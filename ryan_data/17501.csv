"This Vitamin C includes bioflavonoids and rose hips.  Bioflavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found in plants. They are widely used in Europe to treat diseases of the blood vessels and lymph system, including hemorrhoids , chronic venous insufficiency , leg ulcers, easy bruising , nosebleeds , and lymphedema following breast cancer surgery.  Although it's been claimed that combining Vitamin C with bioflavonoids increases the vitamin's bioavailability, the clinincal studies don't offer much support for this.  Rose hips are the fruit of the rose plant. Although rose hips are high in Vitamin C, much of that is lost when it's processed and added to a supplement.  Rose hip powders may work with Vitamin C supplements to reduce the symptoms of arthritis. Compounds in rose hips called galactolipids may help to prevent cartilage breakdown in your joints. The benefits of rose hips in arthritis may also be linked with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of rose hip flavonoids and polyphenols, according to a 2011 study published in ""Complementary and Alternative Medicine.""While these added ingredients may or may not offer additional benefits--my view is that they certainly don't hurt--this product, unlike most synthetic Vitamin C, also is not made with genetically engineered ingredients, is made in Scotland rather than China if that matters to you, and is reasonably priced when compared to almost any form of Vitamin C.  So all in all, it's a good deal","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMU4D7RLGH794/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6C3GCY#wasThisHelpful","RMU4D7RLGH794","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first aid kit seems at first blush to be a great item to have around.  ""78 pieces""--wow, that's a lot, isn't it?  Not really.  Band-aids account for almost half of that, and they're of marginal quality (you may not realize that poor quality band-aids exist until you try these). Throw in some antiseptic wipes and a few gauze pads and you're almost there.  The tweezers are plastic and won't be of much use to remove a splinter.  The scissors, while metal, are the cheapest possible.  There are a lot of first aid kits on Amazon alone, so I'd shop around, or just find a container and fill it with items yourself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HROPX33OXB50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR57120#wasThisHelpful","R3HROPX33OXB50","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm finding this Samsung Scanner-Copier-Fax adequate, but not exceptional.  It handles every task I've given it well enough, and although the set-up instructions aren't clear and the touch screen could also be more intuitive, it does get the jobs done pretty well.  However, I have two different Epson inkjet printers that both cost much less than the Samsung and will do almost everything the Samsung does, and one of them does more, since it will print double-sided copies while the Samsung, oddly, does not.  The quality of photo printing is noticeably better with the inkjets.  The cost of toner cartridges for the Samsung is quite high, and although they last longer than the inkjet cartridges the cost per page is higher.  The Samsung does have an eco setting to conserve toner.It's often said that the biggest advantage of any laser printer over inkjets is speed, if you do a lot of black and white text printing and don't need high-quality photos.  However, these days inkjets can print almost as many pages per minute as the Samsung (19 ppm).  Lasers also can be more durable than inkjets, so for an office, this might be a good choice.  But for lighter duty, and especially where cost is a factor, I'd look carefully at inkjets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D5CRRLB3V13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQBT3RG#wasThisHelpful","R27D5CRRLB3V13","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like most of the other reviewers I received this device through the Amazon Vine program and there hasn't been enough time to fully test it before my initial review is due, so I'll have to follow up later.  But I've used it three times since receiving it and have noticed the hair is growing back more slowly.As others have noted, and as is described on the box, this device is designed for use only by a limited number of people--blonds, red-heads, African-Americans, anyone with a dark complexion, anyone with freckles--in short, anyone who doesn't have relatively pale skin and dark hair, shouldn't use it and it likely won't work for them.  The reason is simple.  The device works on the principle that the intense light it emits will be absorbed by dark material, just as a black object will absorb more heat from sunlight than a white object.  To use the device, you shave your hair first, and the heat from the light is absorbed by the dark roots.  Over time with repeated use, the hair root will die (or so it is claimed).  If your hair is light, not enough absorption, and if your skin is dark, your skin will absorb it instead.  For the same reason, even if you have pale skin and dark hair you can't use it on moles.That said, in my preliminary experience it seems to be doing what it claims.  You place the unit on your skin, it emits a flash of bright light, you may feel a sensation (there are 5 levels of intensity, and you'll feel more if you use the higher levels), and then you move to the next area of your skin.  Repeat after a couple of weeks.  Over time you supposedly won't have to use it as frequently, and in theory, eventually the hair won't grow back.  I'm not there yet, but as I said, hair growth has slowed.The burst of light is quite bright, and if you look directly at it you'll have an afterimage and possibly damage your retinas, so you really should invest in some good safety glasses.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCTQZP06MDGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JY9CSWG#wasThisHelpful","R2OCTQZP06MDGI","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Frigidaire a/c is about as easy (or difficult) to install into a window as most units.  It requires about 23"" horizontal clearance, or maybe a little less, and if your window is wider than that, it comes with louvers to fill the excess space as well as brackets and other installation hardware to secure it in the window.  (It weighs over 60 pounds, so better get a little help to hoist it into place unless you've got a strong back.)  It's surprisingly quiet, at least on low speed, and it turns itself off when the room hits the selected temperature, so unless the room is getting a lot of sun, the unit will do nothing quite a bit, which is great for keeping costs down.  The temperature sensor is on the remote, so you can place the remote where you want it, and the unit will keep cooling until the temperature is reached wherever the remote is, rather than right next to the unit. (Unless, of course, you leave the remote right next to the unit.)  The unit is supposed to keep a 550 sq. ft. room cool, but it works well in the space I've got which is closer to 700 sq. ft.; it just has to work a little harder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLXRU8QMIWNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7XVNAM#wasThisHelpful","R2RLXRU8QMIWNR","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's one thing this stroller isn't good for, and that, oddly enough, is jogging.  It's not designed for it (for that you need the Summit X3 model), so the brand name is confusing.  That aside, it does just about anything else you'd want a stroller to do, and it does it well.It has to be assembled, but that's relatively easy.  The straps are a little tricky to install correctly and require some patience, but the wheels, the seat, the sun shade all just snap in place.The design is extremely versatile.  The seat reclines at different angles.  The canopy adjusts to different angles.  The seat can be placed to allow you to look at your child, or to allow the child to face where you're going.  The handlebar and foot well are adjustable.  If you want to purchase additional items you can add another whole seat (which can be mounted facing either direction),a bassinet, cup holders, bags, canopies, and so on.  Yes, the cost of the base stroller is high, and adding options makes it even higher, but this stroller will last a long time--it's designed to hold kids up to 45 pounds (per seat), which should take you through the first four years and can be passed on or sold.The fabric is durable and wipes clean easily.The stroller maneuvers smoothly in all directions, without any rickety jiggling.  If you're petite you may find folding it a little more difficult than others might, since you have to reach mechanisms on both sides of the stroller at the same time as you pull, but it's very doable, and it folds up flat if you remove the seat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHBFVFPB1TAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3XREUM#wasThisHelpful","R2RHBFVFPB1TAM","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As so many other reviews have noted, these so-called coffee mugs are really best used for soup or cereal, unless you're an avid cafe au lait drinker.  I use mine for soup and I like them a lot.  They're solid, attractive, well-made (no obvious flaws), and hold a full serving of soup, which I can comfortably sip wherever I happen to be instead of having to eat it with a spoon.  A little harder to store than stackable bowls, but you don't have to carefully avoid spilling soup when you carry it.

"This is a short (6 feet long) and narrow (1 foot wide) putting mat that comes with two balls.  The cup holds only two balls, and the bulge across the back of the mat keeps missed balls sitting near the cup and blocks incoming putts, so you'll be doing a lot of walking back and forth to retrieve the balls.  It's adequate, but just barely. More of a novelty or casual gift than something really useful for practicing your putting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHUYOCOBJF48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQYLZ9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1UHUYOCOBJF48","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to seem to be shilling for a laundry detergent, particularly since I received this bottle for free (although if you check my other reviews you'll see that's no guarantee of a positive review), but in my experience using many different detergents, including most of the big brand names and a number of the supposedly more environmentally friendly ones, Tide cleans the best.  Simple as that.  It generally costs more, but in this case, you do get what you pay for.  As for this particular version of Tide, I can't honestly say it's any different from the others in terms of cleaning power--I usually wash in cold water, and any of the Tide products do a good job.  For some reason many of the reviews on this page discuss the Tide with Febreeze, but that's not this product, and the scent of this one is typical of laundry detergents.  I prefer as little scent as possible, but this one's not offensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDPVNJU4Z0FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ6XEQO#wasThisHelpful","R1GDPVNJU4Z0FL","A3006WHOAYJRLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3006WHOAYJRLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these things! I can never use ice in my sodas because I hate how they get all watery and lose their bubbles but with these cubes you get a cold drink that is still fizzy. The trays also feel really durable, which is probably why they give you a lifetime guarantee on these. The silicone also makes it so much easier to get the cubes out without shattering them into a thousand pieces.

"These look and feel great, I just wish they would fit me a little better. I wear a size 6/6.5 shoe and I just can’t get it to fit right. It’s too loose on my big toe and then my last 3 toes are pretty close together and my pinky toe is pretty much nonexistent it’s so small, so they last hole covers my toe almost completely. I thought I could use these for manicures. I love doing my nails and I do my toes less often just because I have a harder time and the foam toe separators don’t work for me. I can make it work though if I mess with it and make sure it’s pushed all the way back but I’m not sure I’ll want to deal with that either just because I have back/shoulder issues and fidgeting with it trying to push it further back causes some pain. I will still give the Vive toe gel separators 4 stars because they are great quality and would work wonderfully if my toes were just a tad longer.

I’ve used these great chunky sticks so far on my lips and eyes. I didn't have any issues with tugging or pulling; these apply really well, feel silky smooth and are very pigmented too. I added some pictures with swatches of all the colors on my arm but it really doesn't do them justice, you can get an idea for the colors but some of the eye shadow sticks have a really pretty shimmer that you can't really see in the pictures either.

"I am in love with this stuff! The smell is so nice, light and citrusy. I love vitamin c serums and I always use one. I haven’t found too many that I like and right now I was using Ole Henrikson’s version. There is always something wrong though, either the smell is unpleasant or it leaves my skin feeling tacky or too wet, well you get the point, I’m picky. This one has honestly been amazing; I have no issues with it. It smells amazing, it absorbs well, and it feels smooth and creamy. I actually like the fact that it’s a little creamier than most serums out there, makes it easier to apply and it feels nice on my skin. My skin is so soft right after I apply it. I’m looking forward to seeing the long term effects of this serum.One thing I like about the formula is that I was reading about Qsomes that is a patented ingredient for them and it helps more active ingredients absorb into your skin.

"I absolutely love this set! I had surgery on my back in 2012 and I've been keeping up with my physical therapy, trying to get my core stronger, keep it strong and also be sure not to gain any weight since that could impact my back a lot. I had a band that my physical trainer gave to me but it was just a light one so I went looking for a band set like this. I like this style of band so that I can wrap it on my ankles or my wrists. I love that they give you 4 too, all color coded and clearly marked from light to x-heavy. I definitely recommend this set! Great for beginners too since you have the light one included and when you progress you can switch. These are also nice because they are latex free and a little wider than other bands I've tried, really gives me a good work out without me having to lift weights.Couple of exercises I want to recommend to the ladies; put one of the bands around your ankles (hold something for balance if you need to) stand straight, you will keep one foot on the ground and the other foot you will lift to the side, kind of like a side kick I guess but you stand still and only your leg lifts off the ground to the side. Another great one is the when you're down on all 4's you put the band around your knees/right under your knees and then do those side leg lifts. That is already a popular exercise but when it starts getting too easy and you feel like you can be on all 4's for hours, add the resistance band and you'll have an awesome butt exercise.  These are a great combo for your butt and outer thighs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LDF3XW2N283/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI9ZQY4#wasThisHelpful","R39LDF3XW2N283","A5UHRK90VTHT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5UHRK90VTHT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve been using this fantabulous garlic press for a couple weeks now and it’s (you guessed it) fantabulous! My family loves garlic, and no they won’t settle for the premade garlic spices, it has to be fresh, which is understandable because it does give a better flavor. I’ve wanted one of these for a while too, not sure why it took me so long to get one! This garlic press is very good quality and you can tell since they back their product with a lifetime guarantee. It’s dishwasher safe and easy to clean, I haven’t needed to put it in my dishwasher, I just rinse it after I’m done using it, nice and simple.

"I definitely found this book to be helpful. I have some minor knee issues from an old snowboarding injury and then exacerbated in soccer over the years. Well now I can’t do either of those anymore but I would like to reach that point again if possible. I need to strengthen my knees and keep them moving so I don’t stiffen up. It’s a vicious cycle, if you don’t exercise and stretch it will get worse but if you do then you’re in pain anyway. At least with the 2nd option you’re doing something to help get rid of the pain in the long run or at least lessen it. I really like how this book shows you helpful exercises but also explains why they work which I always read and find useful. This way I can identify the exercises that would help me most and I can keep doing those more often than the others.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone suffering with knee arthritis or other knee problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34WKIO3CYP17N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608448436#wasThisHelpful","R34WKIO3CYP17N","A5UHRK90VTHT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5UHRK90VTHT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this as a gift for one of my friends who plays the Ukulele. He’s really good, he sings while he plays to us and over St. Patty’s weekend his strap broke and he lost some picks.  I felt bad and so I wanted to find him something to replace those items. I was looking for the items separately when I stumbled upon this ukulele kit that has the picks and strap I wanted to replace for him and on top of that it has hanger accessories so that he can keep it safe if he’s not playing it or holding it. Plus it was cheaper than buying everything separately too so that’s awesome!

"I absolutely love oils for my face, hands, elbows and feet. I mostly use argon oil from Josie Maran but it’s expensive and I’ve been searching for something to take its place. There are so many things to choose from though and I ended up giving this one a shot because of the ingredients, the fact that it’s made in the U.S., and it’s anti-aging! I’m turning 28 this April and I think it’s time to start with the anti-aging potions and lotions! I have always loved Vitamin C in my serums and oils and this one has 20% so it’s really working well to brighten my skin. I have pale dry skin so it’s easy for it to look dull and so I’ve always used a vitamin c serum to help with that and it really works so I’m thrilled that this contains so much and has such a potent version of Vitamin C. Also, seems like this oil was made for me because I have very dry skin, my cheeks flake and if I wear make-up it literally outlines all the flakes on my cheeks and forehead. So I use my Clarisonic in the morning, then put my oil and moisturizer on, let that sink in and then I can do my make up without looking like a cracked porcelain doll. This will be my skin saver! I definitely recommend trying it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRUXYETVAQKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QB7DNW8#wasThisHelpful","R3GRUXYETVAQKV","A5UHRK90VTHT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5UHRK90VTHT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a favorite Aunt, I’m always looking for something to do with them that doesn't involve the usual of taking them out to eat or the movies etc. I wanted to offer them something more substantial. I was lucky and grew up with the Harry Potter novels, I always loved to read and I want my family to share that love with me. I always read to them when they were young and now that they are getting older (10 (boy) and 12(girl)) I haven’t really been reading to them anymore. Well thankfully this book has changed that for us! I was looking for a good young adult novel that would be full of adventure and excitement to keep their attention. They ended up loving this book; we just finished it together last night when I babysat for my sister. I read it to them over time and wouldn't let them read it on their own just to make it more exciting for them. I personally love books like this so it was fun to read it with them, I hope to see more from this author soon, for now I’ll read them the Maze Runner series and hope they like it.

I had back surgery in 2012 and I just really need to keep up with my physical therapy, get my core stronger, then keep it strong and also be sure not to gain any weight since that could impact my pain level significantly. I had a resistance band that my physical therapist gave me but it was just a light one so I went looking for a band set like this. I like this style of band so that I can keep it steady in my hand and have a better grip in general.  I love that they give you 5 too; all color coded and clearly marked from 2 to 20 pounds of resistance. I definitely recommend this set!

"Brainergy-X has been a life saver for me. I am really sensitive to caffeine and most products out there that promise an increase focus and an energy boost are filled with caffeine. I don’t even drink coffee because of how sensitive I am to it, it makes me shake. Thankfully this only has 100mg of caffeine and when I take one in the morning, I’m good for the day. I don’t take more than that and I never experience any crashes or anything like that. It helps me get moving in the morning since I have never been a morning person and not being able to drink coffee didn’t help either. I feel more productive at work when I take one of these supplements in the morning it keeps me alert and focused; I just feel awake and ready to take on any task my boss throws at me! It doesn’t make me feel jittery or sick to my stomach at all which is a problem I’ve had with other brands. Brainergy-X supplements just make me feel like I’m running at 100% instead of around 70% when you’re beaten down by all the stress in your life that just leaves you in a fog. I just feel like I can control what I WANT to focus on better, instead of letting the stress of life, kids, bills etc. take control because they are always in the back of my mind.Not only are these good for the energy boost and increased mental focus they are actually vitamins aimed at benefiting your brain. This is actually what sold me on these, I have dementia in my family and I worry that I’m going to develop it in the future. The ingredients in Brainergy-X are all natural and the product is made in the U.S which is great. All the ingredients are intended to increase your performance in daily life. I love that not only do these supplements have ingredients like Ginkgo Biloba and L-Tyrosine that play a big role in cognitive performance and memory function, but it also has ingredients that work and benefit from each other like the caffeine and the L-Theanine that improve your alertness obviously but it also works to reduce your tiredness, so you’re not just masking the tiredness with way too much caffeine, you’re actually relieving it. These supplements also have a nice impact on physical fitness if you’re so inclined after work or before work when you take one of these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9X5TPN8OY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MD0MJ86#wasThisHelpful","R1O9X5TPN8OY4","A5UHRK90VTHT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5UHRK90VTHT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great thermometer; it’s compact, light, easy to use and I like the design. All you need to do is lift the ear a little bit with one hand and with the other just put the thermometer in, then you wait for the beep and read your temperature. I was able to do it to myself and to my husband very easily. I don’t have kids so I can’t really say on that but it seems like it would do fine for children as well based on my experience and reading other reviews. I also did a series of tests with the thermometer and all of the readings were in a .1 Fahrenheit margin, so that goes to show how accurate it is. I think people are having accuracy issues because they are not lifting the ear, the infrared thermometer might not work properly if you don’t do this. The only downside to this is that you have to wait for it to reset to do another test but it’s not very long so it’s not that big of a deal.

"I received these goji berries for free in exchange for a review. I cannot give this product 5 stars or give it a high recommendation and here's why:While these goji berries have a somewhat pleasing, if more neutral flavor, and they work decently in baked goods, I have a lot of reservations about this product's origins and the honesty of its nutritional labeling.-The packaging of this product advertises that it is packed with vitamin A and C, yet the nutrition label says it contains 0% vitamin A and C. This calls into question the rest of the claims.-It is advertised as being ""Packaged in USA"", but does not state the country of origin. Nutrition regulations for food products require that country of origin is clearly labeled. I assume these goji berries are sourced from China. There is nothing necessarily wrong with a product sourced in China, as quality can vary from factory to factory, but food very much requires this labeling.-These are not legitimately USDA certified and do not have any labeling to indicate authentic USDA certification.  Morning Pep is not listed in USDA's searchable list of companies that have USDA certification-- they are misrepresenting that they have USDA certification (this is highly illegal and misleading to consumers, subject to massive fines).  [...]-The brand/packaging company ""Morning Pep"" is a business that only recently registered in the state of New York on June 2014. It's less than one year old. The business address that was registered with the NY Dept of State - Division of Corporations is a residential apartment complex. ""MORNING PEP CORP, 382 WILLOUGHBY AVE APT 5F, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, 11205"" . Morning Pep does not list any physical location in their contact form on their website and there is no associated business in Nyack, NY, where they claim they operate out of. Take from this what you will.For these reasons, I am very skeptical and would not bet my health on this food product. Please read up on people's experiences consuming goji berries from questionable sources and then make your decision (may cause gastrointestinal discomfort). Unless I see something to prove that this product has been inspected, I can't confidently recommend this.UPDATE:  They've taken to photoshopping the product photo on the Amazon listing.  The actual product will have a label that says otherwise.

"I've been running WD Green drives for many years, changing models out of production every 3 years.  I've never experienced a single failure out of the 30 or so WD Green drives that I've purchased.  My most recent WD Green 4TB drive is working great.  I ran full HDD health scans on this drive right out of the box, and after I had filled the drive to capacity with random data a few times to ensure the reliability-- no issues with data or speed after putting it through the initial torture tests.I always feel that it's necessary to full test out a hard drive before putting it into production-- run a full diagnostic scan while empty, then another after completely filling it with data.

"Chopsticks are an underrated kitchen essential.  Compared with tongs, long chopsticks are better for quickly and precisely flipping smaller items on a somewhat crowded pan.

"These are good quality shitake mushrooms.  Very clean and flavorful, with no dirt or detritus, which is a problem with some of the other unbranded ones available here.  I enjoy using these to make dashi stocks, and then slicing the caps thinly, so that they can be used as a bibimbap topping.  The caps are a little on the smaller side, but the flavor is still very good, with a very meaty texture that one expects from shitake.Only knocking off a star due to the smaller cap sizes and price.  These are about $12.50 for 8oz ($1.56/oz), which is a little more expensive than Costco's 6oz containers of sliced shitake, with are $7.50 for 6oz ($1.25/oz).

Perfect for cat lovers and fans of Japanese wood block prints (ukiyo-e) or Japanese culture, this art book has cat influenced selections dating from 17th to 20th century Japan.

"This is a fantastic, high quality 19V 4.74A charger. The compact design is incredibly portable and this thankfully uses a standard 2.5mm barrel plug, meaning you can use it for many other 19V devices, like non-Asus laptops. I am very impressed with the efficiency of this AC adapter's design, as despite the small size, the adapter does not get very warm, even under full load. A lot of the inexpensive AC bricks you find on ebay and elsewhere tend to get very warm. Spend the money and get a quality adapter to avoid fire risks/damage to your device.I use this adapter for other laptops that I have that require a 19V source and have the standard 2.5mm barrel plug (5.5mm outer diameter, 2.5mm inner diameter).This AC adapter is good for up to 90W use (19V * 4.74A = 90.06W). To make sure that your laptop is compatible, make sure to read the fine print electrical AC input sticker on the back of your device, it MUST be 19V, and draw no more than 3.42A (althought I suspect this adapter is good for up to 95W for short periods). It is OK to use a higher watt adapter on a lower watt device (ie: 19V 2.1A 40W laptop)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36E6KU7YY4ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9KUVWQ#wasThisHelpful","R36E6KU7YY4ON","A3PNN6W95O5XNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PNN6W95O5XNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Valkyria Chronicles is an overlooked gem of the PS3 era.  It is an extremely addictive turn based strategy game with JRPG/anime themes.  The story is strong, and while there are some points where cutesy ""moe"" style anime  fanservice creeps in, it is kept to a relative minimum.  If you enjoy turn based strategy like XCOM and are ok with anime, you will definitely enjoy this game.  Character and squad customization keeps the game fresh and allows for some replayability and challenge levels.Valkyria Chronicles is a solid title to port, due to the turn based nature of the game.  While it is not a perfect port and some menu interfaces don't work as well as they should, the actual gameplay- which is the title's strongest point- is not affected.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy, even those who aren't fans of anime.  The gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles is just that fun and addicting.  Hopefully, if this PC port does well, other titles in the franchise will be released on PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MEK4C1U4VDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1RDZJU#wasThisHelpful","R4MEK4C1U4VDA","A3PNN6W95O5XNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PNN6W95O5XNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A bit saltier than I am accustomed to and many of the cans had very loosely packed anchovies.  Most of the product's weight is in olive oil.  While the taste of the anchovy is good and worked great with the Italian recipes I used them for, I am disappointed at how little anchovy was in the tin-- it is mostly oil with some anchovy mush and not enough firm anchovies.  When preparing anchovies I prefer to have small filets with firmer texture, which leaves me the option of being able to chop up or cook it down into a smooth texture, like for bagna cauda.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1855C59ALP3PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDQXON8#wasThisHelpful","R1855C59ALP3PZ","A3PNN6W95O5XNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PNN6W95O5XNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These gloves are better suited for home cooking than grilling, since the gloves are pretty short.  I have very large hands and while these gloves fit snugly, there were a little challenging to remove and barely covered my wrist area, which is the most prone to burns on the grill.  One of the nice features of silicone gloves is that I have better tactile feedback and grip on what I am holding, compared with cloth mitts.  On the grip aspect, the grip with these is amazing-- these really help with gripping and fastening/loosening slippery objects.

"Recently, I've been getting into hiking and ultralight backpacking and the offer to evaluate and review this product couldn't have come at a more opportune time.  I want to be very careful to note that this is a product that fulfills very specific usage and is not for everyone-- that is, I feel it is best utilized by backpackers and hikers who want to save weight and space by carrying fewer extra clothing items, want to be prepared for a circumstance where they need to wash their clothes, and have a readily available water source available.  There are other scenarios that this product can be used for, but it is in hiking that the Scrubba is best suited.I've washed clothes using a stream and rocks to beat or abrade caked in dirt out of soiled clothing, but there is a high risk of really wearing down your clothes/fabric washing this way.  The Scrubba's nubs are a non-destructive way of working dirt out of your clothes and it does this job rather adequately.  I would recommend packing the Scrubba when hiking in areas with a readily available water supply, otherwise, you'll be lugging around extra water or using your drinking water supply if a washing need comes up.This is also a great product to pack while out on the ocean.  During a recent sailing trip, I really could have used one of these to work saltwater deposits out of some soaked clothes.Lastly, I can also see a situation where having this in the car can be a good emergency backup if you have a spill emergency while on a road, albeit this is a bit of a stretch.Overall, this is a great, rugged product that is very useful for backpackers-- it can also serve as a spare stuff sack.  If you go backpacking frequently, I would highly recommend carrying one of these along.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKQONTIAH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUI7HFC#wasThisHelpful","RKKQONTIAH4","A3PNN6W95O5XNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PNN6W95O5XNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One will need to meter these candles' use in order to get the most value out of them-- these are not candles that you leave burning all day; they are a touch expensive.  Burning one of the candles for an hour is more than enough to fill one regular sized room with the candle's scent.  All of the candles I received smelled fantastic, my favorite being Olive Blossom, which was more subdued.  Lemongrass and Fresh Linen were pleasing, but a bit strong for my tastes.  None of the candles' scents bothered me or gave me a headache, which was a nice change, as scented candles, plug in glade fresheners, and spray air fresheners usually leave me with terrible headaches.

"It hovers over your hand just like the picture and you can pass it back and forth if you hold it by the yellow stem on top and angle it slightly towards the other person.Made out of styrofoam it can handle crashes without breaking.Seems to take about 30 minutes to charge we've been getting about 10 minutes of flight time per charge.It's fun at first but the kids get bored of it pretty quick.

"This orange band connects to your iPhone or Ipad through bluetooth and makes sounds (from the Iphone/Ipad speaker) when you wave your arm around.Some of the sounds are cool for kids to play like swords or ninja stars but the cooking sounds (like eggs frying) are of very limited use.Making a train sound by waving your arm can get annoying fast.The drum and guitar sounds promising but it doesn't really time the beat of the drum to the hand movement. As long as you keep waving your arm the drum and guitar keeps playing but there is some lag and it's a little slow when you are trying to do air guitar.Also, you need your iPhone or iPad within Bluetooth distance (30-40ft) with the app running to hear any sounds. No sounds come out of the armband itself.You can change the sounds on the app and they keep adding new sounds every week.The band is fun for kids and makes lots of cool sounds likeSWORDNINJA STARTRAINBASEBALLBOXINGGOLFTENNISPERCUSSIONLASERBBQSTARS N STRIPES (GUITAR)ANIMAL (DOG,CAT,HORSE,LION)BOXINGFISHING (CASTING, REELING, FISH SOUND)HERO (VARIOUS JAPANESE VOICES)MAGIC (MAGIC WANDS)GUITARDRUMSCOOKINGThe band attaches to your wrist like a slap band.The band could also work great as a special effects sound device if you were putting on a play or something like that.Setup: The website on the box DOES NOT WORK (moff.mobi/setup)Instead you must download the app from the itunes store then watch a YouTube video to learn how to set it up.The link to set it up is https://youtu.be/_tZDBhh04z4 or just search YouTube under Moffband user guide.You must use the app to connect the band to your phone. Regular bluetooth pairing will not work. You run the app and make sure bluetooth is turned on and the audio is not on silent mode.Then you input your username, age, right or left hand, and you are ready to go.You can have more than one Moff Band registered to each account.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below.

"UPDATE: 11/16/15.I've been using this case for a week and the magnets on the keyboard that hold the ipad in place just fell off (see pictures). Now the case doesn't stay together.I tried superglue to get the pieces back into place but it doesn't hold the same. You need to be very careful when you superglue the magnets back on so that they are in the exact same position!I have another version of this case for my Ipad Air2 and I got this one for my new Ipad mini 2.This fits perfectly only my Ipad Mini 2 and has a nice sleek black look. There are cutouts for all the buttons and the camera lens.This pairs with the Ipad Mini 2 with bluetooth and setup was instant and easy and it has never lost connection.The keyboard is small but fully functional with extra buttons on the top for volume control, home screen, power, bluetooth, and arrow keys.The keyboard charges with an included mini USB cable and the charge lasts for 2 YEARS!!!!I can't verify that but my other Zagg keyboard has never needed charging and I use it everyday.The keyboard is detachable and can be easily removed from and the screen (held together by magnets) and can be turned backwards for use as a viewing stand for the sceen if you don't want the keyboard in the front.Overall, this is very attractive and thin case but the build quality is poor. If you buy this you should add a thin layer of superglue over the hinge magnets so they don't fall out.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs UP below!!!

"In theory this plug is a good idea which would let you use an iphone app and Siri to control a single device or a powerstrip.However, the iDevice switch kept losing the connection with my wifi.Even installing it and the app was painful because it kept resetting when it lost connection with the switch.Even when the switch was working it can only be controlled when you are at home in the range of your Wifi. I could not get it to work when I went outside to my front yard.In comparison, I have a few Belkin WeMo switches which work perfectly and can be controlled when you are away from your home.

"These boots are made in Bangladesh, not made in the USA.I ordered a 10 Wide and the fit is very wide. It's about as wide as a New Balance 10 EE shoe so its perfect for people with wide feet and if you like to wear thick socks.The removable EVA insole that it comes with has a small air bubble at the heel but is otherwise super thin and flimsy and I would definitely change it for a better insole immediately. I went with an Orange Superfeet insole.The boot is comfortable but is more of a boot feel than that of a comfortable shoe like some newer more expensive boots. I would not recommend this boot if you have to walk long distances unless you buy a very comfortable insole to put inside it.The tread pattern is very grippy and the steel toe offers good protection for our feet.There are areas of mesh to allow airflow into the boot but it still gets hot and sweaty inside (it's not waterproof).Overall it's an above average work boot that is perfect for people with wide feet.

"Fit and function: 9 out of 10.  With careful adjustment these fit nicely in the ear. The curved plastic will keep them in your ear if you rotate them backwards so the large part of the curve rests on the back of the ear.It comes with small, medium and large size earpads and a curved plastic piece to fit in the curve of your ear.You can also put the cords over your ear for more stability.These stick out of the ear a bit and the fluorescent green color isn't as cool as the beats colors. Conversely, the beats are less comfortable to wear with glasses and sunglasses.Sound quality: 8 out of 10. Sounds clean and crisp. Spoken word sounds great. Sound quality is good at low volume and high volume. Bass is not great.

The application itself although very basic does everything to capture the data that is needed.As I have stated on previous reviews, Is this a big expensive fitbit?  Not at all but for 1/3rd the price of the normal one it does at least capture everything you might need and or want in a wrist wearable.I could not figure out how to get the picture feature to work with the iphone but I did get it to work on the android.

"Let me start out I was a little skeptical but I WAS SO WRONG!  The process is VERY easy depending on where you look the benefits of this are through the roof.If you just pop this with no oil because its not needed then your talking really only 131 calories for the whole 1/4 cup of unpopped popcorn that you use.  With a Calorie breakdown: 10% fat, 77% carbs, 13% protein. <-- Just googled dataThe product itself.  Very easy to use put the popcorn at the bottom and put in the microwave for 2 min.  Keep in mind my microwave is an 1100 watt (i consider it industrial because its huge) so times varies depending.The popcorn itself when it comes out in my opinion tastes better then the air popped and almost doesn't leave a texture to the popcorn itself.Bottom line... .This is great for a diet person or College student... Honestly This would be great in the office at work also because a container of popcorn is MUCH cheaper then the individual bags that burn!Clean up is very easy if you do it dry then just knock all the seeds out and maybe give a quick rinse.  If you use oil then go ahead and wash it using your normal methods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MHJTIAZQ83S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DRD554#wasThisHelpful","R13MHJTIAZQ83S","A1YJU0ST5LVAD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YJU0ST5LVAD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very roomy pouch, it swallowed up my ham radio with room to spare. The material is softer than Maxpedition gear and didn't care for the tac ties for attaching, seems too loose for my liking, even tried different ways with Blackhawk speed clips but still seems looser than Maxpedition molle system. Even if you tuck the tac ties in and try to use the few rows of molle they don't match up right. Ended up getting the Maxpedition for my pack. This is a nice pouch for the money, roomy, same set up as the pricey Maxpedition version. This pouch really does expand and you can get a lot of stuff in it. I like it but not sure what to do with it now? Looks too bulky anywhere I put it. Dont care for cheap zippers that was an issue for me.

"Great for a emergency or get home bag! Like other Maxpedition bags you can stuff and stuff it, but it will like others bags get more round as you fill it.. There is no rigid or plastic back support only padding so over stuffing will round the back and can make it uncomfortable to wear. This is the perfect size for me, it made me re think my choices of supplies and how to pack them. I was totally shocked at how much this would hold, I started out in a Gregory jade 34 totally comfortable with hip straps but too big for car for my liking. So after removing 2 MRE's I got down to a Gregory jade 28 with hip straps, real comfortable to walk with on as gear is only 20 lbs but didn't like the no organization options that hiking bags offer. So thought I'd give this a shot but didn't think it would work as the jade was 1750 compared to the 1400 of this bag! The organization options in this bag are truly great. The full clam shell opening in the main bag makes it easy to fit your gear together like a jig saw puzzle to use every inch. The smaller front admin pocket takes work and a few different tries to get items to not only fit but be easy to get at. The very front small slip pocket does hold more than you think if used properly and for more flat type items such as maps, zip ties, chem lights etc. Not a huge fan of molle bit too military for me but not so much on this pack its pretty nice looking for what it is. The area under the front pocket with the elastic cord worked great for a rain jacket in a stuff sack, nice and compact and fit perfectly and also holds the bag up. The water bottle pockets are small, I cant get a 1 liter water bottle in it, not the Nalgene kind anyway but my metal one works fine. I did attach a MM dump pouch to one side in case extra room is needed its compact and don't look too bulky on the pack. On the other side I tried a condor pouch gadget 6x4x4 but way too big and didn't attach as snugly as Maxpedition pouches. So I got the Anemone but its a bit small, needs one in between the two sizes to be a good balance. Ill figure something out to put in it I'm sure! The top V strap was the perfect place to store 100' of paracord. The quality of this pack is the usual except I am starting to notice poor stitching on the pack and loose strings which I've never seen before. I love the hard feel of the material it holds up GREAT over time and keeps the bag looking new. The pack works in my car and is a smaller footprint. Very impressed as usual with this gear. I just wish there was a flashlight sheath-phone/ radio holster combo, the tri admin pouch is too much for my needs. Should be a new product, the double duty pouch! This is a very small pack but if trying to keep a small footprint with a lot of room if creative this will work! So you know going into this, it's small, check out you tube videos of people wearing pack to see just hoe small, it's the best way to judge it without purchase. I had to buy and try and it did work for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBJWG4PLPLZLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q5E6YG#wasThisHelpful","RBJWG4PLPLZLI","A2TI79NM4NCEUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TI79NM4NCEUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not too big like my Marine K bar for the wilderness, but big enough for in the car or on the walk home, in an emergency. Its not the most expensive knife or the best quality blade out there, but for the price and for emergency use it was a great deal and easy to keep sharpened. If your a commando or Jeremiah Johnson you might not like it. It's a great knife for car kits or medium duty use.

"I was really surprise at just how full of info and pro tips were in this book. Figured it would be gimmicky but not at all. I have tons of prepper books, best ones by Arthur T Bradley- for home survival and Creek Steward bug out for car or outdoors,  even some military guides and I must say this is a great book. It does not read like an end of the world fanatic book. Its more of a comprehensive book on surviving all different types of weather conditions, how to's and gear ideas, expert tip from the army, girl scouts, boy scouts and other experienced outdoor groups. How to improvise different things like snow shoes, bamboo beds, sun glasses and other really cool things. As much as I like all my books as its fun to get different perspectives, this is a great book if you only want one that covers the most outdoor survival. Aurthur T Bradley is better for home weather conditions like tornadoes and floods and hurricanes and the like. There is just so much information in this book its too much to list.The most important thing other than the great information is it's just plain fun to read, not boring or drawn out at all. It also has great stories of doomsday preppers which are cool and funny at the same time although some may find them over the top in the prepping area but the book itself is less over the top and more practical information. It is a welcome addition to my top book collection. It's also a Great gift idea for friends and family. As I do think more people should be prepared at home and in their car, it's just common sense as murphy's law happens to us all at some point!overall: buy it, great read, better info and really comprehensive in types of environments covered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAFYQIJGLB2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426211228#wasThisHelpful","ROAFYQIJGLB2U","A2TI79NM4NCEUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TI79NM4NCEUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice light weight warm winter boot that don't dig into you calf while driving. Many people at work purchased the bugaboo Omni-heat boots only to return them for leaking in water and for the high stiff fit of the boot as well as the clunky-ness. The liftop boots are really quite good, the mens are a bit clunky looking but are very light. I work outside all day and was surprised at just how warm they are with a pair of wigwam el pine wool socks on in -20 with no toe warmers, as they died 1/2 way through my day, my toes were a bit cold but not frozen!!! So far three people at work have returned their boots trying to get these as they seem far more popular and have sold out quickly. I didn't read anything on being totally waterproof but tested them by walking through snow taller than the boots all day and no leaks! The traction is really very good, my kitchen floor gets one drop of water on it and normally your on your but, not in these, they stuck right to the floor and gave me a very confident feeling outside in snow. Not bad on ice but would recommend glacier chains as their cheap and work better than the rolled spring type. The lacing system on these boots really let you dial in the fit. They feel to me about 1/2 bigger than the size stated but work great with wool socks mid weight and up to thick. The toe box it self is wide but not tall, as to keep the air space to a minimum. You can get one pair of toe warmers in with wool socks on. The toe warmers really come into play when its below zero, haven't needed them above 10 degrees. They have a great feature on the shaft of the boot above your ankle which looks almost like pleated material. The boots break-in quickly and that feature above the ankle takes the pressure off your calf while walking and driving. Other models have complaints on their full leather shaft and rough break-in period. Again it really depends on your use of them and personal preference. I also just noticed they have a liftop Omni-heat version of these and would love to buy them if I could find them that is!! The liftop 2 boots seem to have a stiffer shaft that these, an no pleated look at ankle.Bottom line: Best boot purchase so far! light, warm and easy to get custom fit while tying up. Have recommended multiple times with lots of happy warm feet in my area!! No problems even in the -45 to -30 we've been having. BUY THEM, if you can find them!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X8HXDK9E6PGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LP2SRS#wasThisHelpful","R1X8HXDK9E6PGX","A2TI79NM4NCEUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TI79NM4NCEUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It concerns me that wonderful author G. M. Malliet might get pigeonholed into the ""cozy mystery"" category. I have described her books as such myself, and it's true that her mysteries are ""cozy"" rather than brutally graphic and upsetting. But that does not detract from the exquisite way she plies her craft.Case in point: ""The Haunted Season,"" the latest in her wonderful Max Tudor series. In this outing, we find Max and Awena married (not a spoiler; we know this right at the beginning) and new parents (ditto) to the most perfect baby in the world in his parents' eyes--Owen. Max is blissfully happy and we are happy for him, but as we all know, ""murder follows Max."" Having escaped the world of M1 espionage, become an Anglican priest and happily entered into rural English life, the last thing Max wants or needs is to be solving crimes. But once again, murder finds him--again very close to home--and he cannot help but be drawn in to the mystery.You can change an ace spy into an Anglican priest, but as Inspector Cotton (a wonderful regular from previous books) knows all too well, when there is a murder mystery afoot, Father Max morphs into a crime-solver.I really do not want to explain the plot, because there are so many twists and turns here. I will say that Malliet delivers a hilarious take on the upper-UPPER classes, which adds to the fun despite the gruesome murder Max is investigating. And I will also say that this is the darkest of the Father Max books, and I am not going to say why. Read it and see.HIGHLY recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDFVM3GXVOE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021448#wasThisHelpful","RBDFVM3GXVOE5","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had purchased these stairs for use by our elderly dog (since deceased) and his much younger sibling, who had sustained a bad injury to her leg and was not allowed to jump on the bed. Neither dog took to the stairs at all, no matter how much we coaxed. However, we have two very elderly cats and a juvenile cat as well--and all three love it. The juvenile, of course, does not need the stairs, but the stairs have changed the lives of the elderly cats for the better. They can easily climb up to the spare-room bed, where they like to sleep, and back down again. The stairs are sturdy and handsome, a good buy for sure.

"This is truly one of the most brilliant books I have read in my long (never mind how long) life. A sequel of sorts to ""Life After Life,"" it is nevertheless a standalone book--and it completes Atkinson's utterly masterful narrative of World War II. For those who read the former book, which featured Ursula in the most amazingly creative of ways, ""A God in Ruins"" is about her younger brother Teddy, whom we knew as a favored child and who is now an adult, a former fighter pilot whose memories of the war and his role in it never leave him throughout his life.The characterizations in this book are so rich, so fully drawn, so -- I have to use the word again -- masterful, that the reader becomes completely immersed. I forgot where I was when I was reading this. I was in pre-war Britain. I was in wartime Britain. I was in the air, fearing for my life in daring raids over Germany. I was terrified of a serious health problem (no spoilers here). I was everything and everybody.When I finished the book, I was almost paralyzed with admiration and real grief that the book was over.

These shoes go with EVERYTHING, from dresses to casual jeans to everything in between, and for me, they are very comfortable. They do run small, though. It might be wise to order a size up, just to see. And they do have elastic around the entire rim of the shoe, so if you have a particular foot problem, these might not be the best for you. At this price, I would order and see!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCU46SQIFZOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006X412CC#wasThisHelpful","R2HCU46SQIFZOA","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can I even describe how joyful I was at receiving this collection? After a disastrous move in which my entire collection of demitasse cups went missing (and was never found), I had given up my hobby of collecting porcelain. But I saw this teacup collection on Pinterest, and was instantly smitten. These are full-sized cups and saucers, and oh, so beautiful!The box was almost as good as the cups: A hatbox arrangement, which each cup and saucer carefully packed. I didn't want to remove the cups!

"This is the best scale I have ever used. First, it's extra wide, which means that I am not always shifting my feet to make sure my full weight is on the scale (my husband is a large guy, and this feature is invaluable for him!). Next, the digital readout is large and clear, so I don't have to squint at the numbers. Third, the very thin size and neutral color makes the scale blend in bathroom and bedroom. I had to order this scale again, because my cat peed on the first one (TMI?)! It came quickly, packaged properly, and was put to use almost immediately.

"I first ""met"" G.M. Malliet because my local library, in its monthly e-mails to readers, recommended her Father Tudor series, which I gobbled up. Her St. Just (a police detective) series came first, and as soon as I had finished the last available Father Tudor book, I snapped them up to read on my Kindle. Death and the Lit Chick is the second in the series; an utterly wonderful play on the Agatha Christie novels, with no apologies to the late, great mystery writer.A group of authors meets in an old, supposedly haunted castle in Scotland that is now a choice venue for weddings and other events, and in fact they are all there for a literary conference. We meet them one by one, and what a cast of characters!!!! But the one who draws the most attention, the one whom they all loathe for her sudden huge success and her preening over it, is Kimberlee, the author of a ""chick lit"" mystery that threatens the genre of the mystery novel for the rest of them.Our gallant and handsome police detective, St. Just, is there to give a presentation, not in any official capacity. But that all changes when there is a murder at the castle. Who did it? Why? The plot thickens--and thickens again, before it speeds to its utterly satisfying conclusion. I thought I had the murderer figured out rather quickly...then I changed my mind and figured it was somebody else. I was wrong on both counts. Utterly wrong.Do yourself a favor and cleanse your reading palate with this wonderful book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6HUVXCNF936/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EZZ504#wasThisHelpful","R2L6HUVXCNF936","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, PUHLEEZ!!!!First, let me state that I love Mary Gordon, have read many of her books, and admired them all. But I had a very strong urge to hurl this one across the room, and in fact it took me many weeks to finish, as I could not stomach more than a few pages at a time. Why did I finish at all? Because of my respect for Mary Gordon...I grew up in the era when the two protagonists were growing up. I knew Miranda and Adam types, and I probably was more a Miranda than an Adam. But two more unlikeable people I could not describe. Yuck! I will not belabor the plot, as so many reviewers have done so, so I'll cut to the chase. Decades after their torrid but doomed love affair, two older people meet by chance in Italy, slyly brought together by a long-time friend of each of them. They meet at first in the villa of the friend--whose over-the-top mother with dementia gives an impassioned and deplorable speech praising Mussolini. OK, then. WhatEV, as my daughter says.Fast forward to the two ""old friends"" meeting for coffee. Each is happily married, each is secure, but the unspoken ""unfinished business"" between them hangs heavily. And so we embark on several days of their meetings in Italy, each more pretentious and boring than the next, where this reader came to loathe Miranda first--and then Adam. OK, Miranda, you were a dedicated left-winger in the 60s who actually went to global trouble spot to help save the world. Good for you. Adam, you were a dedicated and promising pianist who hid all your emotions and responsibilities behind your music. Bravo.Eventually, we have flashbacks to when the two were lovers, and the young Miranda is no more likeable than the old one, and Adam is a caricature. How can I say this: I didn't care. I didn't care if they met again, if they slept together again or not, if they lived to be 100, I cared not at all about either one of them. I did not see the point of the book, and if there was one, my feeble mind simply missed it.Much as I truly love Mary Gordon, and much as I will continue to read her books as long as she writes them, I cannot recommend this to anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZLMIILNF4V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307390322#wasThisHelpful","R3SZLMIILNF4V8","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this series, and this one was the best. For those who can't understand a nod to the past--genteel ""country"" mysteries with a nod to modern technology thrown in, I am sorry for you. Everything about these novels is delightful, and Malliet has a way of telling tried and true stories with a new twist. Besides, who can resist Father Max?In this outing, things at home are tranquil and lovely as Max and Awena await the birth of their first child. This romance alone is worth the price of the four current books! Max is busily wading through his daily life: sermons, competing singers for an upcoming church musical and so forth, when once again he is called to investigate a crime, this time a suspected poisoned fruitcake! Can the otherworldly and gentle nuns at the nearby convent really have tried to poison the odious Lord who lives nearby?Max does not want to leave his parish and his pregnant significant other, but his Bishop insists. So off Max goes to the convent--where he uncovers centuries of secrets.Loved it, loved it, loved it!

"It takes a fine author to keep a recurring character fresh, interesting, and--well--""in character,"" but wonderful Sujata Massey has done it. What a joy to encounter enchanting, fey, quirky and utterly unique Rei Shimura again, as though she has been a very real friend all these years, and not simply a creation on a page!Rei is now living in Hawaii with her husband Michael (this is not a spoiler; we know this almost immediately), and is so happy that I found myself smiling for and with her! All is well until the horrific earthquake and resulting deadly tsunami hit her beloved Japan. In her anxious, nerve-wracking efforts to reach her friends and family, Rei learns that her beloved mentor, the antiques dealer Mr. Ishida, has gone missing--right in the heart of the area hit hardest by the tsunami. And Rei being, Rei, she defies every obstacle in her path to go and find him.It is here that Sujata Massey again shows her marvelous talent, as she weaves the doings of Rei, who will NOT be daunted, as we all remember so well--with the horror and grief of the aftermath of the tsunami. I remember when the tsunami hit, and I read every press report I could get my hands on, as well as donating to relief, but I don't think my concern touched the surface. As Rei searches for Mr. Ishida, volunteering for rescue work, we can see, smell, gasp and suffer along with the people who had their homes, their neighborhoods, and loved ones snuffed out by the relentless water.Massey adds many details: the stink of the myriad dead fish in the mud; the horror of dead bodies; the misery of those who survived but have no place to go; and the shining hope of a little girl whose father and beloved pet dog are missing.Add a strange mystery about the whereabouts of a blue-haired girl to the mix, and you have a perfect mystery that only Rei Shimura would attempt to solve with every obstacle, literally and figuratively, in her path.Brava, Ms. Massey!!!(Free copy of book supplied in return for an honest review.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARTX1YPN6DRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5SCT34#wasThisHelpful","R1ARTX1YPN6DRQ","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sigh. What can I say without being cruel to the author, who began her Three Pines series with such promise? Let me say this: The first three books in the series were brilliant. The last several have been less so, and this entry had me very badly wanting to throw the book against the wall--except that I would have broken my Kindle. Myriad reviewers have described the plot and the familiar characters--many of whom have become idiotic caricatures (think Ruth). So I'll just add my thoughts:1. The existential, ""out there"" prose and poetic warbles drove me absolutely insane. They came off pretentious and silly and meant nothing. And I do mean nothing.2. I am tired of the main characters being dirty (unkempt, horrendous hair with bits of food in it; dirty hands; etc.) and being loved for it.3. I am VERY tired of every character we came to love in the first few books having ""secret"" and unsavory pasts.All I can say is: GOODBYE, Three Pines! Don't call me.

"Sherryl Woods really cannot write a bad book. It would be so easy for her to rest on her laurels and coast for a few books, as many authors in her position have done (I won't name names; read my reviews!), but she never lets the reader down.Seaview Inn is a charming story that on its face has been told many times in many books: Divorced mother of college daughter returns to her home town that she fled many years ago. College daughter, doing well at Stanford, suddenly takes a leave of absence from college for very emotional reasons. Grandmother wants to keep the inn that has been in her family for generations; daughter believes she should go in assisted living. Trouble Iraq War veteran comes to his birthplace to sort out his soul.OK, if that were the plot and there was nothing more, I might have given this book a whirl--or maybe not, as I have read so many similar books. BUT... we have more to this story.First, we have a poignant and realistic look at the anguish an adult child feels when her parent or grandparent can no longer continue in the life she loves. What should be done? Is assisted living the answer? Or is it unspeakably cruel? Next, we have a very realistic look at a recent breast cancer survivor who, having watched her own mother die of the disease, cannot believe in her own future. The terror is very real and beautifully described. And then we have the bitterness of a wounded war veteran who comes home to find that his wife has dropped him for his best friend.It all sounds so very melodramatic, but it isn't--not when Sherryl Woods is writing the book! Her compassion, her honesty and her very real wisdom shine through on every page. I've already ordered the next in the series, and I can't wait to read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T92QK6BROQ6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB3FIWC#wasThisHelpful","R3T92QK6BROQ6A","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just discovered Liane Moriarty this summer, first with ""The Husband's Secret"" and next with ""Big Little Lies,"" I decided to read her earlier works as well, and ""Three Wishes"" was next on my list.My first thought was, ""Oh, this isn't quite as polished and brilliant as her latest two."" Well, maybe not--but I couldn't put it down. Moriarty has such an amusing and fresh way of ""outing"" real, and very serious problems, in a deceptively breezy, fun, ""frolic"" (I dislike that overused word, but it really fits in this case) that the reader scarcely realizes that she is coming face to face with terrible truths--in this case, mental abuse, which can be as serious and life-defeating as physical abuse--and that is the point of this story.But it's all wrapped up in a funny, original tale about 30-something triplets (two identical; one fraternal, and boy, has THAT been an issue all their lives!) in suburban Australia whose somewhat ordinary lives are anything but. Told with tremendous wit, this story introduces each triplet in turn, and with great sympathy, the author shows us that all is not what it seems.I won't do any spoilers here, but I will say that this is more than a beach read, and well worth reading. Is it as good as Moriarty's later works? No...but it's a preview of her brilliance to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTRRJJ1R14O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014H32E4#wasThisHelpful","R2UTRRJJ1R14O4","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How easy is it for an educated, upper-middle-class, successful wife and mother to become an addict? All too easy, and the slope is more than just slippery. It has an elevator!!!Here is the story of likeable, suburban working mom Allison Weiss. She has a difficult but loveable child, her marriage is a bit iffy but not something that can't be fixed, she has the usual worries about her aging parents, and her daily routine is over the top--but not more so than most of today's ""I can do it all"" mothers. Except Allison can't keep up--not with her impossible expectations of herself, not with the equally impossible demands of the uppity private school her daughter attends; not with the children's birthday parties that are akin to a major wedding; not with the competitive achievements of her wealthy neighbors. So Allison gets help--in the form of prescribed pain pills that she can rationalize away because ""after all, they are a prescription!""The scary and very real story of how Allison's ""just one pill to get me over this hump"" behavior ends up with 60 (SIXTY!) pain pills in two days, is well told, and so very, very real. While falling deeper and deeper into addiction, Allison fools herself (I am NOT like addicts; I am a successful working wife and mother! I am educated! I know the pitfalls! This is under control!), her husband, her mother, and everybody else...until she winds up lying in her own vomit.What is so frightening about this book is that it truly CAN happen to anymore. So, so, easily. And that is the point of this book. It's a warning of sorts, but told with such sympathy and such empathy that any person who has thought longingly of that spare Xanax in the medicine cabinet, or the Percocet left over from a wisdom tooth extraction, or whatever else is hanging around, can react with a twinge of fear.I haven't read Weiner in a very long time, and I'm glad I came back to her with this outstanding book.

"Liane Moriarty is an author you can't take for granted. She has the enormous skill of delivering cogent truths in disarming, seemingly lighthearted stories that just skip along--until the ""Pow"" of the underlying plot hits you smack in the face.Like ""The Husband's Secret,"" ""Big Little Lies"" is a book within a book within a book. Let's begin with the fun romp that forms the plot line. In suburban Australia, in a beautiful beach town, several ""mums"" meet and form alliances on the first day of their respective children's kindergarten. Any mother who has experienced the first day of school with her child will find herself smiling--who hasn't met the ""blond bobs,"" the helicopter parent, the smug parents of ""gifted"" children? I found myself laughing aloud.The main characters are simply wonderful, and so finely drawn! Madeline is an over-the-top, in-your-face hilarious woman who seemingly has no other interests than shoes. Shy, shrinking Jane, the youngest mother, has some obvious problems and needs to be taken under somebody's wing. Celeste is so gorgeous that she stuns anyone who looks at her, and she's wealthy too. Is she happy? If not, why not? Renata is a caricature of every bossy, smug and nasty ""power mother"" we've ever met.On this level alone, the book is a fun, fast, marvelous read. But there is more. Oh, so much more. Beneath these aptly drawn and right-on caricatures is another story entirely, one that is deep, frightening and all too true. And that's where Moriarty's talent lies. She can make you think, and think hard, at the same time that you are enjoying what seems to be a bon bons-and-champagne beach book.We know almost on page 1 that there has been a murder, so I am not introducing a spoiler here. But who? Why? What could possibly have gone so wrong in a group of largely upscale, well-meaning parents?The answer will stun you.Brilliant!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZYFF6KZ5XFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167064#wasThisHelpful","RWZYFF6KZ5XFF","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many reviewers have said that this is a book about ballet. And that is true. But it is SO much more, so multi-layered, so intense, that I cried at the end of the book, not because of the plot, but because of the absolute brilliance.Yes, this story is certainly about ballet. And since I was a roaring balletomane in the time period in which this book takes place, I loved the references. I loved figuring out who was who (Balanchine? Check. Nureyev? Check. A bit of Baryshnikov thrown in? Check. Suzanne Farrell? Check. In fact, the story of the ballet master picking a perfume for each ballerina based on her personality is straight out of real life: Balanchine did that for his dancers as well, and at the time (in the 70s), I thought it was the height of romance.So I loved the plot. I loved the story of the dancers: their competitiveness, their obsession with their bodies, their constant need to be better--and most of all, LIFE LIVED IN FRONT OF MIRRORS.It was only at the end of the book that it hit me between the eyes: The mirrors are fun-house mirrors. The truth and reality reflected back at the dancers has a hidden, dark side. A VERY dark side. And so I have to ask: Was this just a lovely novel about the world of ballet? Or was it an absolutely tour de force...a plot within a plot that reveals a sinister underside--a reality so upsetting, so diabolical that it puts an entirely different twist on the story.SPOILER ALERT:Was Joan indeed a Frankenstein, as her poor husband Jacob says toward the end of the book? Did she actually create and mold a human life to complete her own failed fantasies? And if that is true, is she a devil? Is she evil? Or is she simply a misguided, self-absorbed person with, as she herself says (in different word), a vague, unplanned agenda? We do not know. We will never know.

"This second in the charming Lowcountry Summer series was better than the first (""The Summer Girls""), and kept my interest from start to finish.First, let me say that I am an intense fan of Mary Alice Monroe, have read everything she has written, and look forward to every book. I felt that the first in the series was a tad slow, but this one enlarged upon the characters, gave us something to hold on to, and as always with Monroe's books, made us care about a wild species, in this case, dolphins.We first met Delphine the wild dolphin, a viable character in her own right, in ""The Summer Girls."" Spoiler Alert if you have not read this one: Delphine meets with a possibly fatal accident due to the carelessness of humans. Enough said. In THIS book, there is quite a lot of information about dolphin conservation and care, and I ate it up. It was secondary to the plot, but melded in beautifully, just like Monroe has melded in her stories of wild turtle conservation in so many of her previous books.Yes, Monroe has an agenda, and that is the preservation of the Low Country's creatures, beaches, environment, and charm. And yes, she preaches her message, but unlike other authors of the same ilk, she draws the reader in without lecturing or badgering. Maybe that's because she always weaves her tales around such interesting people, and this book is no exception. The main characters, five women in different stages of their lives with different problems and agendas and yet bound together by family, are well drawn and totally believable. Each has to solve a problem on her own, some very serious life-altering problems--but each has the love of the others to keep her strong.This book left me very anxious to read the last in the trilogy.

"I don't know whether it's the combination of these particular authors, or what, but this new NYPD Red series reads like the old Patterson before he was writing a book a week! I couldn't put it down.In this second in what I hope is a long series, our elite ""Red"" team goes after a serial killer/vigilante who may be the most diabolical yet. The embattled incumbent mayor wants the case solved NOW so he can win reelection. His opponent (both the mayor and his opponent are hilarious caricatures of the real thing--but quite believable) may be tampering with evidence so that SHE can win. And then, just to add some spice, we have a Mafia family worthy of the Corleones. Put them all together and you have a fast-paced, thrill-a-minute, perfect summer read. Does it all make sense? Who cares?I am not going to pretend that this is great literature, but it sure is a fun read around the pool, at the beach, in the shade--or in my case, hunkered down in the AC while the heat simmers outside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CTE4HRX09FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316211230#wasThisHelpful","R13CTE4HRX09FO","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am probably the millionth reviewer of this wonderful book, but I loved it so much that I felt I simply had to add my two cents.First, I had never read Moriarty before, because I had a snobby, stupid sense that she was ""merely"" a ""chick lit"" author who would bore me. I have read and loved my share of ""chick lit"" (I hate that phrase) in my time, so don't get me wrong, but at this particular time in my life, I pick and choose very carefully. And I did NOT choose ""The Husband's Secret."" Until I said, ""What the heck, it's been on the best-seller lists forever; I'll check it out."" And I did.And what I found was a truly well-written, well-phrased, ingenious story that held my interest from start to finish. The Pandora's Box premise reminded me strongly of Kate Atkinson...the idea that one act can change not only a single person's life, but fan out to change myriad lives in ways one never would have, or could have, predicted.I found the characters believable and sympathetic, and I was constantly surprised--especially at the end. Things certainly are rarely what they seem to be, and Moriarty tells her tale with compassion and skill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QVGGV9FJQYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159347#wasThisHelpful","R27QVGGV9FJQYS","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for a friend of mine, a dedicated chef whose entire culinary efforts revolve around her food processor. Her ancient Cuisinart had bitten the dust, and she was devastated. I read the reviews of many food processors, and this one was in my price range and seemed to be a good replacement. I sent it as a surprise and waited with bated breath to see what she thought.She LOVES it. This is a serious cook. She cooks for a hobby, and her life is trying new recipes, almost all of which require a food processor at some stage. She says this one is ""a dream to operate,"" easy to use, meets all her needs, and is a revelation to her after using the clunky Cuisinart she had thought was the be-all and end-all.Now I, who rarely use a food processor, am looking forward to ordering my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4KD6AWNV3JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002V8RNH2#wasThisHelpful","R1S4KD6AWNV3JC","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, gosh darnit, every single time I think that Patterson could not POSSIBLY write anything worth reading anymore, he surprises me. And this book was a major surprise.I had purchased NYPD Red on the way to a quiet summer vacation on the river...nothing to do but read pulp fiction and veg. So I expected very little, and that was fine with me. I have read enough Patterson to know that he will always at least entertain me, and I can check my brain at the door. But THIS book grabbed me!These days, a good serial killer yarn is hard to pull off, as the market is so saturated, and God help us, the REAL-LIFE serial killers are bad enough. And yet, I don't know why, maybe it's his new coauthor's ""fresh blood,"" but Patterson managed to create a serial killer who not only held my interest, but with whom I could almost sympathize! I found myself at times hoping he could pull off his next horrendous murder!!! (No, I am not a serial killer wannabee.) It was just that interesting.So here's the verdict: If you want a fast-paced, riveting page-turner with a hero/heroine set of police partners to love, and a villain to hate, here is your book. If you are looking for insightful, brilliant crime writing like Deaver and Baldacci consistently deliver, this is not your choice. But for me? I'm already reading NYPD Red 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3APQ0YFYJJTDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455521531#wasThisHelpful","R3APQ0YFYJJTDQ","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know what to say...But I'll try. Let's start with the Good.No matter what, Dorothea Benton Frank's love for the Low Country, which I have never seen in person but feel I know so well from her books alone, shines through each and every book, and this one too. So, too, does the fact that she is a nice person. Nothing in her books is ever snarky or mean, and this one is no exception.How about the plot? To me, it made very little sense: Eighty-year-old Maisie has a 65-year-old live-in boyfriend. Possible? Yes...but could I believe it for one second? No. Absolutely not, for so many reasons, and not because I have any prejudice against 80-year-old women, believe me; I hope to become one! Her daughter, fifty-something Liz, is the quintessential put-upon Southern housewife--and yet she is also a high-powered fund raiser for battered women. I couldn't buy it, and every time the author went on a diatribe about battered women, a cause I FULLY SUPPORT, mind you--it made me impatient and more than a little bored. Liz as a mouthpiece took some suspension of belief! Then there is Ashley, portrayed as a strong, modern woman--who blindly falls in love with an almost cartoonishly abusive man because she has a fantasy of becoming the next Jackie Kennedy.Whew.Here's the thing...The reality and heartbreak of battered women is real, frightening, and horrible, and I applaud Ms. Frank's desire to champion their cause, just NOT in the middle of what is a beach read, plain and simple. Her plan backfired. My reaction was to become more and more impatient and negative about the cause in general. I'm sure she did not intend that reaction!And, how could I forget this: Liz and her husband Clayton kept reminding me of Les and Wes, the identical couple in ""The Last Original Wife."" I kept forgetting which book was which!OK, all that having been said, I have loved Ms. Frank all these years, and cannot imagine giving her up. I feel guilty even giving her a ""meh"" review. As others have said, and I agree, authors these days are expected, and I expect it's in their contracts, to produce a book a year, whether they are ready or not. And the quality goes down exponentially with each book. ""The Hurricane Sisters"" is no exception.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H0A45B8D5R6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062132520#wasThisHelpful","R3H0A45B8D5R6O","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Anne Rivers Siddons since her very first book, and have loved them all, some more than others, but each was a pleasure to read and a thoughtful and well-written story. Until now. I found this terrible book excruciating to read, and it left me literally crabby at the end.OK, the premise is the usual pro-forma story of gal pals (I HATE that moniker, and use it here for a reason) who have vacationed together each August for 20 years, through thick and thin, yada yada. Gotcha. So now they are going to a largely uninhabited island, courtesy of the young trophy wife of their friend Teddy, who has remarried after a tragic car accident that killed his wife, their dear friend and contemporary. So, like the mature, 40-ish woman that they are, they have it in for the trophy wife, named ""Baby"" (I'm not making this up!)Fast forward to the car, where one of the women rips the cell phone out of Baby's hand and hurls it out the window, because she doesn't like her texting. REALLY? I hated this character for the rest of the book. Once they get to the island and the gorgeous family home that Baby is extending to them for their vacation, they snipe at her right and left; they ridicule her behind her back (and often in front of her); they drink enough alcohol to kill the average person, and they snipe, snipe, snipe away.Oh. And there are some ""heartfelt secrets."" Of course.And on top of that, nothing in the story rings true, nothing makes sense...I paused so many times to say, ""WHAT?"" Oh, my God, this book is a train wreck. It hurts my heart to say it, because I love Siddons, but she had no business publishing this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WJE8KQQXADS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446527955#wasThisHelpful","R6WJE8KQQXADS","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this on vacation, and absolutely gobbled it up. Is it great literature? No. Has Thayer written better? Yes. But who cares? The story held my interest from start to finish and was perfect for a lazy, hiking/swimming/reading break from all life's cares. One of the main characters in this story (I won't say who) reminded me a great deal of a character in Susan Wiggs' Lakeshore Chronicles series, but that was not a bad thing and it didn't bother me at all. I only mention it because I had the thought so often while reading the book.Thayer's obvious love of Nantucket shines through the story and in my case, makes me want to move there immediately. I won't belabor the plot, because so many reviewers have already discussed it, but the love between the two female protagonists, from childhood through life's pain and cares to adulthood, rang true and was very touching. OK, maybe the idea of rich girl/poor boy is a cliché, but the characters were so likeable and the tale so beguiling that it worked for me.I really don't have a negative thing to say about this book. If you are looking for brilliance, it probably won't appeal to you. If you want a nice, good read for a lazy summer day, this is your book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RVUZ96YIX80F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545486#wasThisHelpful","R1RVUZ96YIX80F","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see I am in the minority here, and I don't want to ruffle any feathers, but this book made me crazy. First, let me say that I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club series, and have read every single one. And it seems to me that the women get more and more stupid with every book, and the plots get more and more off the wall. Yes, I kept turning the pages, because Patterson does know how to hook the reader--even me. But I found myself getting increasingly annoyed.We'll start with my beloved Lindsay Boxer. She has a beautiful baby girl, whom she actually sees awake maybe 10 minutes every three days. She not only has to work late, to which all working mothers can relate, but when she CAN get home, she goes out instead with her girlfriends. Her mothering is confined to a kiss on the head and warm, fuzzy feelings--and oh, yes (spoiler alert): taking the baby out in the stroller when she knows there is a psychopathic serial killer after her.Then we have Claire, the ME, whom I always have loved...and SHE (another spoiler alert) is sneaking alcohol into the hospital room of her badly injured friend, because, being a doctor, it would never occur to her that alcohol might not mix with the pain killers and other meds that her friend is taking. REALLY?And Cindy, the Journalist Extraordinaire. She decides all by herself to single-handedly stalk one of the most dangerous psychopathic serial killers (see above) in the world. She puts herself in infinite danger, for a story. OK, we know she has an ego and wants the Pulitzer, but she has been a lot smarter than this in all the other books, and her navete is infinitely annoying.Yuki is Yuki, and I love her. She seems to have stayed true to type.Now let's go to the over the top plot(s). There are three intense plotlines going at once. That's fine; lots of authors of this genre do that. But each ONE is completely and totally off the wall, and to have all three going at once is like having one dessert too many...a type of sustained, out-of-body experience. Two of the plots are suddenly and quickly resolved. One is not, so now we know the subject of Book 14, which I WILL read, no matter what, because despite my criticism, I still like this series. Go figure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTJI24DCCVBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031621129X#wasThisHelpful","R3QTJI24DCCVBK","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, how I loved the Claudia books in my early years. I can't even remember how many times I took them out from the library, reading and re-reading, loving them to death. And they stayed in my memory for decades. So very recently, I decided to see if I could find them again--and I did, right on Amazon, and was lucky enough to get an original copy, published during wartime (World War II)--complete with a plea for War Bonds on the back flap! Wonderful.And then I started reading, with great anticipation. And soon I was very, very sorry. First, let me say that I know the original stories were written in 1938, a far different time in so many ways. But the pompous young husband, whom I IDOLIZED when I was young, and the airhead young wife, who doesn't even know what a mortgage is, but has to have her Godlike husband explain it to her--do we really want to return to those days, if they ever existed?With mounting disappointment, I kept reading--while Claudia proudly glories in the fact that she was so ""bad"" that her husband David had to turn her over his knee and spank her--""just like a caveman,"" and wasn't she lucky to have such a masterful husband?Ew, Ew, and Triple Ew. This ""ideal"" actually helped shape my early views of marriage and womanhood, and thank God I got over it!I kept looking in vain for the lovely charm that I remembered from these books, which, I must reiterate, I truly loved. But I could find no charm at all, only stereotype after stereotype, from the stolid, fat German servants to the ""intellectual"" sister-in-law (who of COURSE cannot have children) to Claudia and David themselves to just about everything else.Oh, how I wish I had left this book in my memory.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IFEJ9U1PQNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LOD3VC#wasThisHelpful","R38IFEJ9U1PQNA","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just a sweet and good book, a reminder of an era gone by, when people still had sensibilities, when there was no Internet, when life was handled without cell phones and texting--and when religion was a very serious part of life.This gentle story of a recent widower, a devout Catholic, and the nun at his church who is questioning her vocation could be cloying and over the top. But it is not. It is written with such love, and such respect, that it is peaceful to read. The subject matter could be offensive to some readers, but I do not see how. The nun who is questioning her vows is so good, so deeply troubled by the thoughts she cannot pray away, that it is impossible not to be in her corner. Ditto the man whose life is shattered by the untimely loss of his young wife, as he struggles to come to grips with his still alive virility and his desire to be a good man and a good father.This book takes place in the time before Vatican II, when life could be very rigid for devout Catholics, so the anguish these two protagonists feel is very real and very palpable.I had never read LaVyrie Spencer before, and I am so glad that this is the book I chose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKA1FLWX5A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515150770#wasThisHelpful","R1SKA1FLWX5A2","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I devoutly hope that this is not the last John Puller novel from Baldacci.I am no stranger to Baldacci ... I have read all his Camel Club books, all his King and Maxwell books, one Robie (and soon to start another), and more. I also discovered ""Zero Day,"" his first John Puller novel, and liked it--and the character--very much. So I ordered ""The Forgotten."" And not only did I fall in love with John Puller all over again, but I was so ensnared in the plot that I could barely tear myself away!I am reviewing this after 3,000 people have gone before me. So it's ridiculous to even discuss the plot in any depth. But I will say this: It is hard to keep my interest. I am an editor by trade, and I read all day long, and by the time I have time for personal reading, I'm somewhat burned out and my attention span is not what it should be. But I was hooked from page 1.First of all, unlike many other popular authors of this and similar genres, Baldacci writes well. He truly does. So I do not find myself exasperatedly ""editing"" the sentences as I go along. Second, no matter how much I think I know what will happen, and even when I am RIGHT about what will happen, Baldacci never fails to surprise me. This book had me on the edge of my seat, especially in the last 100 pages--and I stayed on the edge of my seat until the last word of the last sentence of the last page of the book.Did Puller survive? I wasn't sure that would happen. Did the heroes survive? Did the bad guys get their just desserts? Maybe--and maybe NOT. You'll have to read it to be sure.

Seemingly mundane in nature (a loved-hated developer, who has a lot of opposition in Trafalgar, is found brutally murdered and everybody and nobody is the suspect), the plot proverbially thickens until just about everybody is a suspect.I just loved the combination of love and humor Delany uses when describing Molly's over-the-top mother and other hippies who don't know what year it is--having lived in that generation, I could relate!Excellent novel; on to the next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLX9D7WEJTB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590585585#wasThisHelpful","R2MLX9D7WEJTB8","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While a fast, competent read, as are all of Siddons' books, this one is full of unremitting distress, broken by some oases of happiness that are as over the top as the distress, making the reader dread the next chapter.Our heroine and narrator, Thayer, is a very likeable woman, from childhood on. She is strong and vibrant--and yet seems unwilling or unable to resist the unspeakable cruelty of her mother, even though she knows from a very early age what her mother is, and what she is capable of. So when Thayer goes repeatedly into a type of psychic trance every time her mother attacks (and in one memorable scene, attacks in a way that will leave Thayer damaged for life), it is hard to believe. She didn't see it coming? She didn't figure it out? WE did...over and over and over.There is magic, both imagined and maybe real; there is madness; there is true cruelty; there is some laughter and love...and through it all, Thayer floats around with a ""bubble"" around her, protecting her from all knowledge of what is going on. It's the way she survives--or maybe not.I did not understand the ending at all, and still don't. It was told in metaphors and allusions--and I didn't get them. Am I alone?I love Siddons, have read everything by her, but this was very strange and very unsatisfying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RAMCX7S6LIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446566950#wasThisHelpful","R36RAMCX7S6LIK","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, let me start out first by saying that, flawed as this book is, it held my interest during one heat-wave-plagued weekend where I was forced to sit reading in the AC or melt. I hardly put it down. So obviously, the book is not a complete dud.However, the more I read, the more I said to myself, ""Oh, another disaffected Catholic book""; I've read many, and that was how I saw it and it got on my nerves no END. That having been said, this book is NOT funny, NOT lighthearted, NOT a breeze read. The main character, Alice, is one of the most hateful protagonists I've encountered in a long time, and despite her guilt over her long-kept secret, I had no sympathy or understanding. She was simply hateful.Her daughter and granddaughter were interesting, if not cliched...surprisingly, the only woman in the book I felt sorry for and interested in was the ""goody-two-shoes"" daughter-in-law, Ann-Marie. My heart broke for her on many different levels, and I felt she was more finely drawn than the others, more believeable, more likeable, more real.I can't say not to read this book, but do not expect what the blurbs say, and do not expect a resolution or any kind of meaningful wrapup at the end!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2040UBHJNPIZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307595129#wasThisHelpful","R2040UBHJNPIZB","A18M68DE1Y6W51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18M68DE1Y6W51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles Ives--while never quite invisible--endured a long period of relative obscurity.  As his centennial approached in the 1970s, interest in this unusual composer began to increase.  Young musicians found a kindred soul.  More established musicians found good reason to program Ives's music (this was before the days when orchestral boards demanded pablum). This was the time that I first encountered Ives. His music has been an occasional companion ever since.It should be said that a little Ives can go a long way.  He was prolific and perhaps not particularly disciplined as a composer, and left us many pieces in varying condition.  His style--a casserole of sentimental music, layered with abrupt changes and discordances, often makes it hard to distinguish one piece from another.  But among all of this music are some real gems.  The Piano Sonatas and the 4th Symphony are solid and serious pieces.  So is ""Three Places in New England"".  The St. Gaudens movement (inspired by a powerful bas relief on the Boston Common) is a slow march of ghosts.  There is supreme irony in the use of ""Old Black Joe"" as primary material.  ""Putnam's Camp"" gives us a tangible feel for an army campsite, with marching soldiers, campfires, caissons and onlookers.  ""Housatonic"" interweaves long horn and string lines with the fog of string tremelos.  This is really effective tone painting.  The second orchestral set, also on this CD, is less successful although the opening movement has much to recommend it.I've often thought of Carl Ruggles as something of a one-hit wonder.  But oh what a hit!  ""Sun-Treader"" has one of the most breathtaking introductions of any piece I know.  It's a fortissimo timpani beat with a searing brass crie du coeur.  After decades it still makes me sit up straight. The overall sensibilities of the piece are quite German. It is a sonata form, but virtually all development is contrapuntal.  There are inverted canons, retrograde canons, bits of counterpoint long and short.  There's a quite logical sense of the long line throughout these 15 intense minutes.  The coda mixes the original material with a powerful recitativo in the strings.  This is a stunning piece of music.Ruggles wrote only a handful of pieces and destroyed most of those.  The other piece included on this CD is ""Men and Mountains"".  While it has its moments, the dissonance feels gratuitous and the form is disjunct. It feels like all of his other music pointed the way to ""Sun-Treader""There was a pleasant surprise for me on this CD.  That's the ""Andante for Strings"" by Ruth Crawford (Seeger).  I'd heard the String Quartet from which this movement was derived, but it made little impression on me at the time.  I'm going to have to rethink that.  The Andante in its orchestral form has a pulsating and needful urgency.  If you were told it was Ligeti or Lutoslawski, you wouldn't have any trouble believing it.  It's a single phrase that builds to a logical peak and then dies away.  Ruth Crawford had just begun to make a name as a composer when she turned away and began editing collections of folk music.  That is our loss.This CD is twenty years old, and I'm sorry I'd missed it until now.  Dohnanyi gets to the core of the music and the recording is quite good. These are essential pieces for any collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTXTAAT4BJO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000042D4#wasThisHelpful","R3FTXTAAT4BJO0","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had many years of experience as a bass and guitar player. But I've always used a traditional 4-string. I needed a 5-string for various reasons, but I wanted to start out with a minimal commitment. I've had previous experience with Ibanez and always felt that the brand gave a satisfactory experience for reasonable dollars.That's the case here. There are few obvious places where corners were cut.  Knobs and machine heads aren't top of the line--but they're serviceable. Pickups might be improved, but those are really very personal choices for a player.  And the finish won't knock you over with beauty.  But the positive attributes outweigh the negative by a long shot.  The neck has a fairly flat profile and is easy to get around on. It's actually quite straight--I've see far worse necks on more expensive instruments. The whole instrument is quite light.  This may mean that it doesn't hold up in gigging situations where it gets knocked around.  But it's a spare studio instrument for me and will be treated tenderly.The thing I like least is the active pickups. There's a knob that goes from flat at one end to a hypered bass/treble boost at the other.  Gain and distortion go up as a result.  You're far better off managing the EQ in your amp.  You can find simple plans on the web for bypassing this circuit, and that's the route I'll take when I've got a little time.But again, you've got to think about what you're paying (which isn't much).  This is a value instrument for either a starting player or for someone who needs a spare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UI03ZPYZU9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWIRU1A#wasThisHelpful","R10UI03ZPYZU9G","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are perhaps two primary targets for this work center.  General contractors will set it up somewhere on the job site and cut framing all day. Then there are homeowners with limited room in their shops.  I fit squarely into the latter category. I seem always to be setting up temporary tables or even extending my saw table to hold a workpiece while I drill, cut, sand or whatever I'm doing.  For my needs, there are many very good ideas in this stand:First of all, the legs fold up underneath without requiring disassembly. The wheels allow you (if you're very careful) to roll the stand into a corner for storage. The outrigger extensions will hold large pieces fairly steady, with a decent amount of height adjustment.  The built-in power strip is tremendously welcome, and the gooseneck LED light--even with a too-narrow beam, helps to illuminate key areas of the piece you're working on.The most notable feature is the pair of extension locks.  These clamp on to the main frame very easily, and hold your miter saw, drill press or other tool.  They should also be able to hold any sort of jig you might need to make for pipe-bending or some other purpose. There's an easy hand grip on each arm that makes attaching and removing a snap.But there are some serious fit-and-finish problems here as well. There are adjustment knobs to hold the outrigger extensions--basically just a bolt with a plastic knob.  One had molding problems and came apart in my hand.  The other looks like it will soon follow suit.  The ""tool storage"" area is laughably small with a plastic door that's waiting to come apart.  There are cross-braces for the legs that are clearly an afterthought.  They provide minimal stiffening and must be removed in order to fold the legs into the body.  But the biggest issue I encountered is the support T's that slip into the outrigger extensions.  The fit is so tight that it's almost impossible to move the T's up and down.  Both T's had this problem.  I inspected them carefully to try and find any sign of shipping damage, but there were no bends or distortions.  The rough finish of the T, combined with the low tolerance hole, means that the thing is simply too tight.  I'll probably try a bit of graphite first, followed perhaps be a silicone lubricant. But I have doubts as to my success.  It took a rubber mallet to get one of them to move and the other wasn't much better. The operator's manual could use a bit more detail as well.I think that Porta Mate has the bones of a very good product.  Whether the problems I encountered are design, manufacturing or quality-assurance problems, I simply can't say.  But I think they're addressable and I hope the appropriate steps are taken.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLD7M2U4CY7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUZA7CE#wasThisHelpful","R2DLD7M2U4CY7U","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're under the sink dealing with a balky flare joint, you will sometimes need an extra hand to hold a nut in place or to loosen it. A locking plier of this type might be the answer.  This trio covers most necessary sizes, and has a nice wide maw to get the tool into place before clamping down. The Vise-grip style lock is sturdy enough to hold sufficiently for most cases.I do wish the set was better-built though.  The business-end--the jaws that hold the nut itself--is a little rough and uneven.  It's enough that you might find yourself needing to replace the nut after a use or two. Welds at the angled portion are also crude.  I think they're more than solid enough, but they just don't look like quality.I will commend the manufacturer on simple packaging--a cardboard box and acid-free paper around the tools.

"Once upon a time, a laser printer was a luxury item. Those of us who couldn't justify the cost found ourselves first with dot-matrix and then with inkjets.  While it's true that a high-quality inkjet will now give better overall results than a laser, it comes with a high cost for consumables and a certain level of fussiness.  That cost isn't always justified when you're printing primarily documents or drafts.This very nice printer from Brother now brings all the advantages of laser printer at a very low cost. It's impressive right out of the box. There are no flimsy plastic extensions to manage paper flow.  The paper tray is internal (it looks like it will hold a full ream) and the paper output sits nicely in an internal tray.  This should help keep dust from accumulating on paper and going into the printer mechanism. It's clear this is a monochrome printer--the documentation steers you toward ordinary bond paper and away from all the coated papers you might use with a photo printer. The print quality is quite readable.  It's not as black as a good inkjet black, but I was able to print at 5-point resolution and easily read the result.  And a very big plus is the ability to do double-sided printing without swapping paper around.  Just specify double-sided output, queue the job and that's what you get.  Nice.  It's a little on the loud side: not terrible, but noticeable, and you will need to be prepared for a slight whiff of ozone when you print.There are two ways you can set this device up--the touch-screen display and a browser interface.  You'll find yourself gravitating toward the latter choice.  The color touch screen is bright and attractive, but it's also quite small.  It's almost impossible to enter text there.  My fingers were simply too large, and I could barely get by with a small pencil eraser as a substitute.  Good enough for running a copy, but that's about it.  The browser interface on the other hand is quite nice.  Using that (and a temporary USB cable--not included) it's very easy to set up your wireless networking and to perform status checks at any time.Copying and scanning can be done easily enough from the front panel, but scanning is more easily done from the host.  Windows software is included and support is built into the Mac. Scanning quality is good (up to 600DPI), but it's not photo-scan quality. Colors are a bit washed and detail is a little soft.  But as a document scanner it's perfectly sufficient.Additional kudos to Brother for providing a real printed manual.  It's not the complete manual (that's available online), but it's a lot more than the two pages of cartoon drawings you get with most hardware these days.I'm using the device wirelessly.  It goes only to 802.11/n --no C--but it does receive on both popular bands. I'm using a Mac, running Yosemite.  In setting up the wireless connection, I encountered a bug.  Strangely enough, that's one of the reasons I'm recommending this printer strongly.  The bug appeared in the failure of the device to wake from sleep (it goes to sleep after a minute of inactivity, unless you change that value).When testing a device like this, we don't always get the chance to comment on the quality of customer service. Most problems don't appear until later, so followup comments in reviews may never be seen.  So it's always a positive to be able to report on the experience that a few users will invariably encounter.  I contacted Brother's customer support (available in several modes--I chose chat) and described my problem.  I did not identify myself as a reviewer.  The representative was courteous and professional and knew her stuff.  We walked through a set of tests and procedures and never once did I sense impatience, even though we took well over an hour. When it appeared there really was a problem, she escalated the call and told me I would hear back within 24 hours.  She was as good as her word.  I was contacted by technical staff the next morning.  We went over a number of things and finally settled on a workaround.

"This is the movie that begat a whole stream of very funny movies from a great ensemble cast.  Rob Reiner got the ball rolling with Spinal Tap, and then Christopher Guest kept it going with Guffman, Best in Show and several others.Heavy Metal rock is often an unintentional parody, which explains the fact that many original viewers thought this was a documentary.  And the fact is that it's only a slightly enhanced version of the truth.  My business puts me in contact with a fair number of old rockers, and this movie could have easily been about many of them.  From the unenlightened lyrics to the woozy sophomoric philosophy, this captures an age.It looks great in BluRay and the bad music sounds--perhaps not 'great', but clean. If you're of a certain age you'll see things you remember (and possibly see yourself)--if you're able to see through the tears of laughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDYN0A3E4IQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y5JFN4#wasThisHelpful","R1TDYN0A3E4IQ3","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the residents of my household is a medium-sized parrot.  He's had one of these for years and it's a favorite toy. He alternates between guarding it and rolling it out for a game of toss.  I can say that it's taken a beating, but has still held up for all that time. It's a good-sized toy for medium/large parrots.  They can easily pick it up and shake it, giving the reward of the bell inside.  If you know birds, then you know the more noise, the better.We've picked up a second one as a reserve.

"George Van Eps is a name known by guitarists--even without knowing his music.  It's not far off the mark to describe him as one of the progenitors of modern jazz guitar. Before Van Eps, the guitar was a resident of the rhythm section and rarely stepped out to the front of the band. Van Eps--along with his 7-string guitar--envisioned a guitar that could be an equivalent to piano.  And he got there.  It's hard not to hear his chord passages as an antecessor  for the later work of guitarists like Wes Montgomery or Howard Roberts. Although he lived a long and productive life, his playing never had the prominence of contemporaries like Charlie Christian or Montgomery.  But he deserves a listen and the listener will be rewarded.The recordings on this CD are all from the late 1940s, and most sound like they were transcribed from 78s.  They haven't gotten--and may never get--the sort of detailed cleanup that many vintage recordings deserve.  You'll need a first pass just to get through the technical limitations.  But after that, you'll begin to to hear what Van Eps was doing.  His chording is firm and precise and his lead work is restrained and always tasteful. There is no slop in this playing. His guitar sound is basically acoustic, with just a bit of amplification (a guitar sound that's still never been surpassed).Most of the performances are here in multiple takes, and each take is rather different from the others.  That's jazz. Enjoy.  It's a treat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOFZL3LU0WQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000254Y7S#wasThisHelpful","RXOFZL3LU0WQP","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been through a few routers in my day.  All have strengths and drawbacks and this unit from Belkin is no exception.  But the strengths outnumber the drawbacks and many users will find this does a great job for them.The first thing you'll see on starting up (like all routers, it provides a browser window) is an attempt to hook up to the web.  Before you start that, you'll need details from your ISP, including the communication methodology (PPPoE, etc) and any passwords. Some ISPs require a specific MAC for the router (mine does), so you'll have to bypass this automatic method and go straight to the control panel. Once you're connected, you'll be able to fine tune the router.  You'll head to the control panel for this as well.The control panel is pretty easy to navigate, and you can find and adjust the features you need pretty easily.  If you've been around routers, you'll have few problems.  If not, you'll get less help than you need from the user guide (downloadable PDF). It's incomplete and doesn't begin to describe the capabilities of the router.  This is an area where Belkin needs to apply some effort.  I was happy to find that the default security settings were pretty strong.  You can tighten them up by restricting known phishing sites and so on.  I do wish that the default for SSID broadcast was OFF, but maybe that's just me (This is the point that someone invariably posts a comment that SSID broadcast doesn't matter.  I don't disagree when you're talking about the creep in the coffee shop who knows his way around Wireshark.  But most of these systems will be in residential areas where you're just worried about a neighbor grabbing some free bandwidth for something he shouldn't be doing).  I also wish that Guest access was off by default. Naive users tend to leave these things on, and that's not the right thing to do in a world where security takes on increasing importance.Wireless performance was quite good.  My ISP gives me about 60 MB/s and I had no trouble getting that performance a floor away. When I was a floor away and about 40 feet laterally, it fell to about 20 MB/s.  Another very good Buffalo router (802.11/n) falls to just over 2 MB/s at that same distance. The antenna is inside the case, and you don't have to twiddle with external antennae (that's usually a pointless endeavor anyway).There are two USB connections on the unit.  One is USB2 and the other USB3. You can connect a media drive to either of these and use the included Twonky DNLA server software.  I like Twonky a lot: it's easy to use it as the heart of a media center.There is one drawback (in addition to the poor user guide).  This unit does not support reserved DHCP.  I have an unusually large network for a residence, since that network is also supporting two businesses.  I prefer reserved DHCP for many devices in this network because it lets me easily save links to the control panels of devices on the net without having to slog through network logs to determine the current IP address.  I think that Belkin could improve this in a firmware update and I hope they do.  This drawback keeps me from using this as a replacement for my Buffalo router.  However, it still works very nicely as a wireless access point, so I've connected it that way and still improved the overall performance of my network.Belkin has come some distance from their starting point of cheap cables and hubs.  This is a nice step along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCOF6VXWS29Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U6NS5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1HCOF6VXWS29Z","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LED lighting has come a long way in just a few years.  The first generation showed promise, in a dim sort of way. But they're now ready for prime time. Many users are now replacing unloved CFLs with cooler and safer LEDs.  Most of the fixtures in my house have made the transition, and just about all that's left is a few long 40-watt fluorescents.The first thing you'll notice is the relatively small diameter of the tube.  The next thing you might notice is a label claiming 32 watt equivalency (hold that thought). A minute on the stepladder and bulbs were swapped.  That 32-watt equivalency turns out to be noticeably brighter than the 40-watt it was replacing. I was also pleased at the nicely-diffused light.  Those earliest LEDs tended to be very directional, with hot spots and lots of shadowy areas.  These Sylvanias have a perfectly smooth pattern.

"I've long enjoyed Michael Shermer's one-page essays in Scientific American.  For that reason, I looked forward to spending time with this book (it's a big book, so you'll spend lots of time with it). Having said that, it took me some time to warm to the task.  It started out feeling rather like a compendium of information I already knew--with particular debt to the work of Steven Pinker. But it picks up steam rapidly and ends as a quite worthwhile experience.You can't have a book about morality without defining your terms.  For some, morality is a set of dictates from a bearded man in the sky somewhere. For others, it's simply a group of rules created ex nihilo--with the aim of controlling people. Shermer spends a good amount of time showing the evolutionary roots of morality and how we can still see those early forms at work in the animal kingdom. He defines morality a number of times, but each shaded definition feels much like the old Golden Rule. Our actions, if they are to be moral, should be felt as fair by the recipients of those actions.No discussion of morality is complete without talking about religion. In recent years, a number of writers (Dawkins, Harris, et al) have written strong arguments against religion.  There's a certain ""rah rah"" nature to many of these books, and I don't find a hint of that here.  At the same time, Shermer shows clearly that religion has always been a clear reflection of culture--pro-inquisition, pro-slavery, anti-female, anti-gay--until a changing culture drags it along, usually kicking and screaming.  Religious readers may not be comfortable with this section, but it's written fairly and without anger. Moral behavior is concerned more with actions than with belief.One cannot speak about moral behavior without talking about IMMORAL behavior.  What do we do about it? Leaving aside issues that may be contentious, we would all argue that stealing and violence must be controlled in a successful society.  Shermer's chapters on justice constitute the real heart of the book for me. He defines types of justice.  Of those, two stand out:  Retributive justice (lock 'em up and throw away the key) satisfies our baser instincts, but often leaves little satisfaction and no compensation in the hands of the victims.  Restorative justice (there's a great example from New Guinea) shares the aim of punishing the criminal while still trying to give reparation to the victim and strengthen the society.The final chapter is given over to speculation.  Where might we go in the decades, centuries and millennia to come? Will our current bloated nation-states wither away?  Will visiting aliens be moral or Conquistadores?  Shermer is an optimist (probably more so than I am), and his thoughtful book provides a persuasive argument that we're on the right course.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26M2F329VK89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096914#wasThisHelpful","R26M2F329VK89","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's always an element of adventure when heading to a new format. For me, that's the H.265 codec.  With less-than-ideal bandwidth in my media center, lowering the bitrate can be helpful.  Of course, H.265 is a new codec and continues to undergo development.  It was with full knowledge of this that I decided to try this: one of the earliest devices to support H.265.I could deal, if only barely, with the terrible excuse for English in the user interface and the user guide.  The device is made in China, but there are plenty of Chinese who speak excellent English.  Perhaps this company should consider hiring one.  My excitement faded further when I saw what an absolutely impenetrable mess the user interface is.  It's covered with ""apps"", most of which I'd delete--if I could.  Doesn't seem to be permitted. The UI always seemed to go to the wrong place.But where they lost me was the wireless hookup.  I try to keep my home network secure, and one of the things I do is hide my wireless SSIDs.  This device offered no way to type in an SSID, so the ID had to be visible.  I turned on SSID broadcast on my router and eventually got connected.  Reasoning that the SSID would stay in the device's memory, I then turned off broadcast.  No dice. The player disconnected.How was the H.265 playback?  Fine, but that's because it's a new chip that's available to any manufacturer.  I'll wait for it to appear elsewhere.  The Tronfy was rushed to market and it shows.

"Over the last few months, I've had the opportunity to test a number of headsets which are supposedly targeted at gamers. While there may be a few elements of industrial design which appeal to a gamer's sensibilities, in the end these must pass muster as headsets. They need to sound reasonably good.  They need to have decent microphones without significant breath or handling noise. And--perhaps more than anything else--they need to be wearable for hours on end.These phones satisfy those requirements better than most.  The sound is nicely balanced.  There's low end without being too exaggerated. Highs have presence without being painful. They don't have the presence of true high-end headphones, but they don't have the price either. The microphone does a good job of eliminating breath noise, and has a good enough sound for talkback or podcasting.  I also like the way that it slides back into the ear cup when not in use.As far as the final criterion--comfort--these are among the best in this category.  As with my very high-end AKGs, these are supported mainly by a flexible sling that passes over the head. There's very little actual pressure (I've tested headphones that felt like clamps).  Combined with the overall lightness of the set, you should be able to wear these for hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8UE8F4CIATS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O06ZMD0#wasThisHelpful","RF8UE8F4CIATS","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Donald Hall no longer writes poetry and that's our loss.  But he shows considerable powers as an essayist in this concentrated little set. There's a nice circularity here: he begins with a description of his day--compressed into just a few small rooms of his old farmhouse. He then takes us through a group of set pieces, a newlywed drive through Yugoslavia, illnesses that stole a wife, honors (and dishonors), and then increasing infirmities that bring us back to life in the here and now. There are moments of great seriousness, but just as many that show a wonderful dry wit (his one-sentence description of Mick Jagger is worth the entire book).At most times, Hall maintains a certain distance: just as he did in his poetry.  He's not dispassionate, but instead he's leaving room for the readers to experience their own emotions--to inhabit the world with him.  This is not what you might expect from a valedictory, but it shows a real generosity.  He's not preparing to die.  Instead he's learning to live in a smaller world.I'm now at the boundary between late middle age and whatever we might call the next stage.  Most of Hall's experience of old age lies in front of me (let's hope).  But much of what I see in my ancient parents and their diminishing circle is well-described here.

"One shouldn't expect caviar on a peanut butter budget, and this headset is no exception.  The phones are functional, and actually don't sound bad.  Ergonomically, they need some work.  Even though they're lightweight, they still don't sit comfortably: in order to get a reasonable seal around the ear, they feel clamped-on.  I couldn't wear them but a few minutes before I had to take them off. The microphone would also benefit from a wind-screen. There's no way I could eliminate the sound of the wind stream from my nostrils. Other headsets have success in this area, and it seems that Turtle Beach could do some work here.  While targeted at gaming, these things are often used for multiple jobs: this would not be a good choice for Skyping or podcasting.I did appreciate the connection flexibility.  There's a mini-phono connection for use with smart phones.  There's also a USB adapter (with volume control a a bit of bass-boost) for use on a regular computer. But for me, these positive attributes were outweighed by ergonomics.

"In my house there's a small table by the door.  It seems to be the place where all devices go to charge.  There always seem to be more devices than wall outlets, so oftentimes it's one device after another. This little multicharger is a handy way to charge things all at once. The power cable is quite robust--it actually looks like it could carry considerably more current that would really be needed.  I can't say I've had all four outlets in use, but I have been using three--bluetooth earbuds, iPhone, iPad--and there doesn't appear to be a penalty for multiple simultaneous charges.  I do have to note that the iPad 2 will charge slowly.  It will claim that it's not charging at all, but it will be accumulating a charge.  This is an issue with most chargers and appears to be specific to iPad.It's a small point--but it matters to me--that the charger comes in a minimal package.  It's a simple cardboard box and is only what's needed to get the box from Amazon to you. Easy to open, perfectly protective and a bit easier on the environment.

"This is an interesting bit of technology that needs a little more work to make it a solid recommend. Let's talk about what I liked first.  The sound is excellent.  Bluetooth streaming tends to have a lower bitrate than wired headphones and that's often noticeable.  While these buds won't replace my Shures, they sounded quite good--unforced with just the tiniest bit of midrange honk.  They also do a good job of measuring heart-rate and of pacing a workout.  The hear-rate measurements themselves were very good and the buds also managed a pretty good approximation of the pseudo-distance I covered on my treadmill, coming within about 10 percent of the number given by the treadmill.  I can only speculate about how this works.  I assume there's a built-in accelerometer that works in conjunction with the height I type in on the personal information.  I wasn't bothered at all by the small deviation.I was more surprised by the variance in calorie burn.  The Jabra system gave me only a fifth of the calorie consumption computed by the treadmill.  Of course the treadmill knows that I put it on the ""straight uphill"" setting and the earbuds have no way of knowing that.  Still, it was a very large variance.  If my workouts were targeted at calories, I'd be concerned that either the earbuds or the treadmill was way off.The physical design of the earbuds is pretty nice--they stay in place because of a soft rubber tine that nestles into the ear.  I've had lots of earbuds slip out when I get sweaty, but these weren't a problem.  However, one of those rubber pieces must be moved out of place to slip in the charging cable and it can easily fall off the earbud and get lost.  I think this needs addressing.Of course to get any of this stuff working, you need the software.  It was easy to download (free) on my iPhone, but I've got to say the software is something of a mess.  The first piece you get is a music app--completely unneeded on an iPhone.  From there, you download the sport app which can track your workouts.  Unfortunately, some of the features (like resting heart rate) are recorded in the music app.  This is nonsense.  Why the sport app can't be completely self-contained is beyond me.But my biggest concern is privacy.  This is an app that connects to the cloud, and the potential for abuse--either by Jabra or by people who hack Jabra--is high.  There is not a statement about privacy with the software and there are no preferences that allow you to control where your information goes.  It's an absolute black hole.  It may be that absolutely no data leaves your phone.  Or it may be that you get data-mined in every way possible.  It's a total mystery and I hope that Jabra will comment on this review and clarify what's going on.  I'm concerned enough about the potential for abuse that I'm likely to forgo the many positive characteristics of these buds and remove the software.  Perhaps it will integrate more directly with the built-in Apple software in future.  There's absolutely no way I'd trust these apps on an Android system.So it's a tough call.  If your concerned about security, then I'd wait for a definitive statement from Jabra.  if not, then it's a pretty nice little system.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQ4IDGO0D9YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2359DU#wasThisHelpful","RPQ4IDGO0D9YV","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was just over a year ago that I review this device's predecessor, the Ambient Weather WR-111B Emergency Solar Hand Crank AM/FM/NOAA Digital Radio, Flashlight, Cell Phone Charger with NOAA Certified Weather Alert & Cables.  Very little has changed, and that's a positive. The two models are externally indistinguishable and basic performance and battery life are about the same.  There are two very minor new features: There's now a siren mode (it really sounds more like an electronic phone ringing) and an emergency light blink.  There may be a few cases where this is useful. But since the siren doesn't sound like a siren, it may not really summon needed assistance.  There's also a mode in which the radio is permanently connected to power.

"There's really not much to say about an entry-level switch.  This one works with no diminution of speed (compared to my primary switch) using a NAS drive.  It couldn't be easier to use--plug it in--so it's a nice choice for a small office or simple home setup.  There's no port prioritization, so there are likely to be better choices if a media server is part of your system.  But it's dirt-cheap and does the job.The biggest problem is the wall wart provided with the switch. the plug-end is configured so that it will take up three spaces on your surge protector.  A simple 90-degree change in the orientation of the plug would have made a big difference.  So if your surge protector is close to filled up, you may need to budget for another one.  That makes this switch just a bit less of a bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WS0SJ4VEAJPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFD0SEA#wasThisHelpful","R2WS0SJ4VEAJPY","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what science fiction is all about.  It's not about intergalactic princesses, bug-eyed monsters or dogfights in spaceships.  It's about us. It's a story that could occur in a possible future (not too far away) and brings us face-to-face with a number of ethical dilemmas.  It forces us to consider our growing power in biology and it shows us a whole new kind of slavery.It's almost all Sam Rockwell, who has only the voice of Kevin Spacey and himself to play against.

"This review was originally very positive.  I really liked this keyboard for quite a while.  Then...The keyboard began to have battery-charging problems after a few months.  After investigating online, I found that this was a fairly common problem with this keyboard.  So finally in late August of 2014 I contacted the Logitech service department.  The technician was friendly and walked me through a set of questions.  In short order, she promised me she'd have a new keyboard sent to me.  In just a few minutes I received an email requesting sales receipt and a snapshot of the serial number.  I sent the information right back to them.  So far so good.  But I received no shipping information and contacted them through the service account.  I was once again asked for the receipt, so I sent it again.  Then I stopped hearing from them.  I received no further reply to numerous emails and requests for information through the support account. The case appears to have disappeared from their online service department.  At this point I can no longer log into the service account, and the ""reset your password"" results in no email being sent to me. It appears that my account has disappeared. This is not how you treat your customers.I've nursed this keyboard as far as I'm able, but it's now time to purchase a new one.  It won't be Logitech.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AZ91CK92HTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005L38VRU#wasThisHelpful","R4AZ91CK92HTP","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are few things that rival the excitement of a delivery truck arriving with a large power tool.  This saw comes well-packed, in 3 containers, with perhaps the largest chucks of polystyrene padding I've ever seen.  First look at the saw is impressive, but my ardor was cooled a half-hour into the build.  Let me say right here that the saw cuts nicely, but what I experienced during assembly was enough to concern me about the longterm prospects.  I'll also say that the ""control"" saw was my 30 year-old Craftsman--a saw that still cuts beautifully.Among the first things you do when the saw is still in the inverted position, is to attach casters and leveling feet.  Here's where the first problem arose.  While one foot went in easily, the second could only make 3-4 turns before it would go no further.  A careful inspection revealed that the hole had not been fully tapped, or perhaps that the threads had been badly crushed (I think it was the former).  I had to retap the hole.  A tap-and-die set is not part of every woodworker's kit, but I was glad I've got one.After I finished assembly of the base, it was time to flip the saw rightside-up.  The table is absolutely drenched in machine oil.  While the argument could be made that this preserves the saw from rust, other manufacturers manage to clean this up before shipment.  You'll have to be very careful to remove all this oil before any wood touches the saw table.  It was during this cleanup that I was snagged by the second gotcha--literally.  While passing a rag though the guide groove for the miter fence, an edge sliced right through the rag and into my fingertip.  Can't somebody do the final stage of polishing off their machining?  After a week, the finger was healed up, so it's back to assembly.At this point it's time to remark that the assembly portion of the sparse user guide is absolutely terrible.  Illustrations are miniscule and there are no exploded diagrams of key assemblies.  Everything, whether a bolt or a screw, is called a screw.  There's a difference.  On top of that, the bolts/screws described in the assembly section don't match what's in the parts list.  It's also a mix of SAE and metric sizes.  Why?  I'll gladly admit that someone intending to do woodwork should have basic assembly skills, but this is inexcusable. But the real kicker is attachment of front and back rails.  The rails are drilled with more holes than this saw needs (perhaps because they're used for multiple saws), but you're really on your own figuring out which holes to use.  The back rail is shown upside-down from its intended assembly position.  I stood there for the longest time before I realized the manual should be ignored in this regard.The wooden extension table has a vinyl veneer on a low-quality plywood base.  A little pre-drilling would be helpful here, but you're on your own.  Be sure to start with a pilot hole (the manual recommends going right for the 1/4 bit) so that the plywood doesn't splinter.  And when the leveling tool is used you'll find that the feet for the extension are too short (yes I had the feet on the base at their lowest position).  Plan on keeping a chunk of wood around to place at that end of the saw.But I finally did--after far too much time--get the saw assembled and aligned.  My first project was a cabinet.  The included blade is pretty generic, so I removed it and went for my fine-toothed blade.  I was actually pretty happy with the result. Miter cuts were accurate, the gauge on the rip-fence is spot on (you can actually cut on either side of the blade).  I also appreciated the fact that a plastic pusher tool was included.  Even when ripping a 1"" slice, the guide was narrow enough to safely push the work piece through.  I'm a stickler for saw safety, and I really do appreciate this.  The extended table is also nice for setting up work.I've gone back and forth about whether to go with three stars or four for this review.  The saw cuts well (but no better than my 30 year old Craftsman).  Setting up a series of cuts is smooth, and the vacuum attachment is appreciated.  But the initial quality was much lower than it should be, and my overall impression is that it's a little thrown together without a top-down sense of what it should be.  I have no idea how long the motor's going to run.  If it's still going several years from now, I'll gladly come back and tack on the extra star.  But based on what I've see thus far, I can't give it the benefit of the doubt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ALP8S5K3QBIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHUWABO#wasThisHelpful","R2ALP8S5K3QBIH","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last few years there have been quite a few entrants into the category of 'gaming' headsets.  It's a little difficult to determine exactly what qualifies headphones as 'gaming'.  Perhaps it's the presence of a microphone or its ability to connect to an Android or IOS device.  Go figure.The first peek at this headset was not overwhelming--it's over-packaged in a box with lots of throwaway plastic and the industrial design is an angular throwback to the 90's.  It didn't fit my definition of beautiful. Two cables are provided--one very short single-connector cable and a slightly longer cable with dual-connectors.  The single-cable connector matched with my iPhone, so that's the way I tested.  Unlike many headsets of this nature, the microphone isn't on a boom.  It's on one of the cups, so it stays out of the way.  There's a little toggle switch to mute the mic.The phones are quite lightweight and fairly comfortable.  The over-the-ear design doesn't quite seal you off from the outside world, but it works well enough for most situations.  There is a volume control on the left cup.  Unlike some devices, this does not control the level on the iPhone itself.  It simply modifies the level sent by the phone.  You'll need to set a max level of the iPhone and then tweak from there.  The microphone button works as you'd expect. Press it to take an incoming call.  Or press it to summon Siri, from there allowing you to set up an outgoing call or a voice memo or whatever you'd like.  Music playback is paused and muted during this period.The sound is OK, but not particularly compelling.  There's not a whopping bass boost or brain-frying treble, and I really appreciate Mat Catz restraint in that sense.  But the overall sound is a little distant and veiled. Fine for gaming, but not quite there for serious listening.There are many headsets to choose from.  These are fine if the look works for you.  But there's nothing particularly stand-out about them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3HQNDEBPKYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF1EC1W#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3HQNDEBPKYE","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took Amazon quite a while to find this CD: it's surely been long out-of-print, and the original recordings are over a half-century old.  But my patience was rewarded.  Some of Britten's finest (and least-known) work was done in a liturgical context. While ""Noye's Fludde"" requires larger forces than ""The Burning Fiery Furnace"", it's clearly a kindred spirit.  Here's the ancient story of the flood--a staple of Middle Eastern prehistory--and this setting comes from a Chester miracle play, the same source of much of Stravinsky's wonderful ""The Flood"".Britten's best work is amazingly strange: fundamentally tonal, but highly flexible. The core orchestra of strings, piano and percussion is augmented by a group of bugles and other instruments more frequently heard in the hands of amateurs.  Spoken and sung parts come both from professional soloists and a boys  choir.  The bugles--natural instruments without equal temperament--create an archaic and heraldic sense.  A final processional (I assume it's the animals leaving the ark) is magical, with a oddly fragile combination of piano, handbells and recorders underlying the choir.  This is a piece well worth hearing many times.""The Golden Vanity"" is considerably less substantial.  It's an entertainment piece for childrens choir with much stamping of feet and other comedic effects.  It's probably great fun to perform and to see, but to ears alone it doesn't really offer much protein.  No matter.  ""Noye's Fludde"" is well-worth the price of admission.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS5Q1DCW9956/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IO63#wasThisHelpful","R2GS5Q1DCW9956","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to see a guitar these days without a tuner on the headstock.  For the last couple of years I've used a Snark tuner.  But that was then.  This D'Addario is an improvement in every way.  For starters, it's small and light with a display that has enough illumination to see in a dark venue.  The display swivels easily, but the characters can also be inverted in the case of a very unusual mounting. Buttons are raised and textured so that even calloused fingers can navigate without looking.The tuner itself goes from A-410 to A-480, using increment/decrement buttons.  There's also a metronome (no sound--just a left/right/left/right blink on the display) which goes from 20 BPM to 270BPM.  I'd have gladly traded the slowest rates for a little more on the 'Presto' side. When either of those parameters passes max, it starts again at min (of vice-versa). I'd rather it peg at the extreme value, but it's a small objection.But the most noticeable thing is that this tuner is FAST.  The Snark needs a few seconds to settle in, especially with long wavelengths (low notes).  The D'Addario is almost instant, and the display gives very good hints about which way to go (the sharp symbol ""'#' is a little hard to read).  I tested this on 5 instruments--classical, steel-string acoustic, solid-body electric, archtop electric and even an electric bass.  The tuner was fast on all of these instruments and tuning was a snap.  Any player should keep one in the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPCULYV4CMGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1LLJUW#wasThisHelpful","R3KPCULYV4CMGQ","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have quite a selection of Perky-Pet feeders around the yard, both for hummingbirds and songbirds.  If you know hummers, you'll know they're pretty feisty and it's best to have a selection of feeders spread over the yard (a single feeder will get hogged by the dominant bird). This one went into an unoccupied corner and it took all of 3 minutes to have its first visitor.  We're lucky to have three species--Blackchin, Rufous and Broadtail--and they've all been to this feeder.  It appears that variety is important, so we have white, yellow and red ""flowers"" all around.  I wonder if they taste different to the birds.Perky-Pet has taken many steps over the last few years to make their feeders easier to fill and to clean.  The wide top on this one makes filling a snap.  The base comes apart into many pieces, simplifying cleaning.  But you do have to be careful putting it together and transporting it.

"I'm continually amazed that you can purchase a very nice large screen television for just a few hundred dollars.  Great picture and great features, but usually a little lacking in the sound department.  While this Vizio unit won't turn your home into a high-end theater, it will bring a nice improvement in your experience while taking virtually no room.  It packs decent stereo speakers, along with an amp--and even a clever little subwoofer--into a package that you just place underneath your TV.There are few televisions that won't connect to this unit.  If you've got a digital out (either coax or optical) or even an old pair of RCA connectors, you're ready to roll.  The package comes with all cables, so there won't be an emergency trip to the box store to get overcharged. The user interface is simple--perhaps just a bit too simple--and consists only of a row of lamps on the front.  A small remote comes along.How does it sound?  Not bad at all.  While I'm not sure it really gets to the claimed 101 dB, it's more than adequate for a small or medium-sized room.  The little sub does a decent job of give some depth to the system, but it begins to show the strain before the rest of the system does.  The Peter Jackson remake of 'King Kong' has quite a few low tones for animal grunts.  At high level, they were just a bit too much for the sub, which began to break up.  I could improve this by using the minimal tone control (bass/treble with no indication of where the filter frequencies were).  Unless you're pushing it though, the frequency response is well-balanced, lacking a only bit of definition in the high midrange.  But if you're looking for an audiofile system, you wouldn't be looking here.  This is for an apartment or a family room.There are a couple of DSP modes with the unit, provided by DTS.  There's a dynamic range compressor--useful for late-night viewing.  There's also a pseudo-surround mode that impressed me more than I expected.  There are a number of acoustic tricks that go into making surround without surround speakers, and I usually dislike them.  But this was a pleasant surprise.  You do have to be close to the centerline, but there was a nice overall sense of space.  Airplane flybys were pretty convincing, too. My hat is off to DTS for this one.There's a remote mode mentioned in the manual for those with Vizio televisions. I assume it means you'll be able to use the TV remote in place of the little one in the box.  I have a Panasonic in this room, so I wasn't able to test that feature.  It's likely to take some fiddling around with remotes and codes, but with some luck you'll be able to do some consolidation and keep this remote in a drawer.Inexpensive HD TVs with week sound have spawned quite an aftermarket for soundbars and auxiliary systems. This is a nice entry in that arena.  It's unobtrusive and sounds quite nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235Y0F6HRWKCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KONCCW2#wasThisHelpful","R235Y0F6HRWKCM","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no secret that I'm a fan of Western Digital network drives.  I use a pair of high-capacity RAIDs as backup for my business and I've long used the MyBook series as media servers.  I didn't need much persuading to try out this new drive.The first thing you'll notice is that WD has been moving their look from black to off-white.  While my drives typically live out of sight in a machine room, this is still an attractive enclosure that will look decidedly less ""techy"" if perched beside a television or in another visible location. Basic setup couldn't be simpler: plug in the network cable (provided) and attach the external power supply.  The power cable is a little longer than you'll see with many systems and that's much appreciated.  You can install a provided application that will then help you find the drive, or you can simply look for the IP address in your router log.  Once that's done, all setup and maintenance can be performed from the web browser of your choice.As soon as you connect to the device, you'll be given the opportunity to register and create a My Cloud account.  Then you're taken to a main screen that provides basic status, firmware version and a few panels that will give access to more common functionality.  While it's true that I have expertise in the network area, I still appreciate how simple WD makes this device--over the years I've seen steady progress.  The first thing I do with a new NAS is a system diagnostic (that takes several hours) and a speed test.  Even over gigabit ethernet, this won't set any records.  Average read/write speeds were 77/31 respectively.  That's not likely to be a problem with the applications that My Cloud is targeted toward.You can create user accounts as needed, whether for family or employees, and you can divide the disk into some number of shares that can be private for each user or can be shared in whatever fashion you need.  You can attach USB drives of any sort--either to extend the amount of space or provide a backup area.  Setting up cloud access is relatively simple unless you're a complete tech novice (in which case it's time to buy a beer for a friend and ask for a little help).  You can then see files on the device from any remote location as long as you log in properly. You CAN see the files from a web browser but WD recommends against it, for the security problems inherent in Java.  They provide apps (I tested on a Mac and an iPad) which are somewhat more secure.One place where Western Digital really excels in in DLNA (a core technology for home media service).  With a device like this on the network and a TV-Live beside the television, you can encode in just about any format you like.  There are few--if any--NAS devices from WD that can't act as DLNA servers. Another nice feature is the notification feature.  You can have the device email any address(es) whenever an update is available, or whenever it's powered up or shut down.  This can be helpful if you float among several computers.  Unlike many of these devices, you DON'T have to enter your own account information to enable this.  The device contacts WD and WD contacts you.There is a question you should ask yourself, and that's whether or not you should put your information on the cloud. I don't think it's always a good idea, since it provides an attack vector into your system.  Still, if you're careful with passwords and maintenance, it can be a great way to share family photos and such with at least as much privacy as commercial alternatives.  There are many companies making NAS drives, but Western Digital is always my first choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJRGLQRFWDDWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVVGAC6#wasThisHelpful","RJRGLQRFWDDWN","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Time is kind in many ways when we think of Beethoven.  Errors have been well-corrected in the majority of his scores so that we have a good chance of hearing the notes he intended. The greatness of most of his pieces is reflected in the frequency of performance, with hundreds of recordings available stretching over nearly a century.  A good student orchestra can manage a few of the symphonies and his piano sonatas are staples of advanced recitals all over the world.But time has taken away many things as well.  We're no longer surprised or angered by his key changes or his protean forms.  We don't get many of the jokes embedded in his pieces.  After over a century of equal temperament we don't even hear the underlying reasons for his choice of keys.  And when we look at his many portraits we don't see the face considered to be ugly in his own time.  It's just Beethoven. At the worst, Beethoven has become comfort for many--a pleasant set of tunes that let the listener avoid musical challenges. How wrong that is.Jan Swafford has done much to take us back to Beethoven's own time: to know the man and to know the music. As a composer in his own right, he's well positioned to explain the true nature of the music.  And he's at less risk than most when he delves into the thinking behind Beethoven's choices. The reader should be warned that this is a book for musicians.  There's much to learn and enjoy in learning about the person, but there's also a lot of shop talk here: musical examples and musical terminology.  There's a helpful appendix, but if you don't read music you'll often be missing the point of what Swafford is saying.Because the book itself has a dual purpose, it might be worth taking some to to divide the review.  So let's take a look at the man we find in those pages.  Beethoven was the son of a mediocre tenor (and drunkard) and the grandson of a kappelmeister (another Ludwig).  In those days a musician was just another servant--poorly paid and dispensable.  By the standard of the day he was a man of low birth. His town of Bonn still felt the last gasps of the Enlightenment, but that was really more lofty talk than anything.  Ludwig surely felt every slight, and over-reacted at every opportunity. The patterns of his life appeared early on.  He loved humanity in the abstract, but in reality was misanthropic and narcissistic.  He managed to alienate every single person he knew, whether friends from childhood, other musicians, or nobles who could do him some good.  He courted many women (at least in his own mind), all unavailable in some way.  They may have been put off by his appearance or by the knowledge that he'd have made a miserable husband.  A few loyal friends stayed with him, enduring his paranoid rants, but he still managed to find a lonely life for himself.  It's the current fashion to provide a psychological diagnosis in many biographies (however misguided that might be).  Swafford wisely ignores that, providing the facts as best shown in accounts and correspondence.  Of necessity he interpolates on occasion, but he's clear in those cases.  This is neither a hatchet job or a hagiography.  Instead it's a sensitive account of a life that would have been painful to live. As bad as being around Beethoven could be, it must have been terrible to BE Beethoven.One thing that struck me throughout was how astutely Beethoven built his reputation. He moved to Vienna (a town he hated) when Mozart and Haydn ruled supreme. While he admired them both, his relations with them were wary.  He knew that Mozart ""owned"" opera and Haydn owned the string quartet and symphony. So he began building his composition reputation with cello sonatas--a form unexplored by his seniors. He moved into larger forms gradually, when he thought his pieces could hold the stage alongside acknowledged masterpieces.  And every challenging piece was accompanied by something gracious and accessible.  I found his sense of musical place both calculating and admirable.Interspersed along with the biography are a great many musical details.  In an early section, Swafford discusses tunings.  The equal temperament we've known for the last century was not widely in place.  Keyboard instruments of the day were still tuned in various forms of ""just intonation"".  Swafford goes into a brief explanation of this and demonstrates why intervals are strikingly different, depending on key.  Remote keys, like D-flat, were considered barely usable by many.  Beethoven chose his keys precisely because of these tuning aberrations and was consistent throughout his lifetime.  While there are a few musicians who still tune their instruments in this way, the opportunity to hear the ""Emperor Concerto"" in a true E-flat is denied to most of us.  The real shock of a Beethoven modulation can only be inferred, not experienced.At several points along the way, in pieces Swafford considers uniquely formative, there's a more complex analysis.  So you'll find score examples and in-depth discussion of the 3rd and 9th Symphonies, the Missa Solemnis, the late B-flat string quartet and others. This is the place where some musical training is critical.  One can't help but be reminded of the essays of Donald Francis Tovey. Swafford's passages here are equally concise and informative.  Swafford does a creditable job of avoiding flowery language when simple technical terms will do. But there are places where he can't conceal his excitement and the occasional high-flown phrase is completely forgivable.I must admit to mixed feelings about the form of the book.  While each analysis is placed chronologically where it belongs, there's a bit of a jarring feeling when jumping from biography to analysis and back.  As well as it works in its current form, I still wonder if it might find a wider audience if divided into sections for biography and essay.  It's a small quibble.I haven't begun to touch on the scope of this book--Beethoven's recurring health woes, his abortive guardianship of his nephew, the bright and talented women performers who were the backbone of his early reputation, the hangers-on who created a romanticized view that prevailed for a century.  I haven't mentioned the mechanical amplifiers on his pianos or the terrible performances that plagued him.  I haven't even mentioned his deafness.  But it's all here, in a book that's both sensitive and compelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTI9CYKTYU34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061805474X#wasThisHelpful","RUTI9CYKTYU34","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had quite a few A/V receivers over the years--several HK units, along with a number of Onkyos.  This is my first Denon, and the differences were immediately apparent.  This thing simply SOUNDS better.  A lot better. I'd passed on Denon a few times when considering a new receiver.  While the sound was always highly-rated, Denon always fell a little short on the system control feature list.  That's no longer the case.  There are more than enough HDMI inputs, along with a pair of outputs for mirrored monitors. To that array of inputs you can add several flavors of Internet radio, along with Apple Airplay and Bluetooth streaming and even a direct iPod connection.  Up to 7.2 can be supported (in my test room I have 5.1).Perhaps it's because I've been at this for a long while, but I tend to do setup without consulting the user guide.  I like to see how intuitive operation can be, and I'll only consult the guide if I'm really stuck.  I got a long way and only had to hit the guide for a few more esoteric things.  Unfortunately Denon follows the practice of providing the guide as a PDF on a CDROM (C'mon Denon, don't cheap out with the manual). Upon power-up, assuming you've plugged in the monitor, there's a quite thorough setup walkthrough--even down to individual speaker cables.  The back-button on the remote will get you out of this so that you can set up at your own pace.It's worth pointing out that the remote is nicely organized, with the important MUTE button in a sensible position. If the phone rings, you can quickly cut the sound without hunting all over a crowded remote.As with any high-quality receiver, Denon provides a calibration microphone and an automatic room EQ program.  Kudos for Denon's practical sense of humor.  For people who don't happen to have microphone stands, Denon includes a stand made of several folded pieces of cardboard.  When assembled it looks like a toy rocket.  You'll chuckle, but it works.  Clear instructions are displayed on the monitor for microphone positions and other aspects of the procedure.  I have to say that the calibration on this receiver is much more successful than on many others.  Additional tweaking is usually required, but this unit was ready to go.  And it really sounds nice.  There's a tremendous sense of integrated surround with good source material, whether on BluRay or satellite.  The orchestra stays clear of the screen and gives a lovely sense of being out in the room.  Effects pans move smoothly from speaker to speaker without jumping. You can tweak if you need, but that's only for the fussier among us.  Dynamic range compression works smoothly and unobtrusively.  There are four basic ""Sound Modes"" accessed by dedicated buttons on the remote--primarily for film, music and games.  Denon can't resist a couple of those awful reverbs for those who want the sound of a stadium or nightclub.  I'd rather have an accurate representation of what the mixers did in the studio.  Thank goodness that's there in spades.Network setup is quick and easy.  I have a wired network in this room, but Denon will support either wired or wireless.  A firmware upgrade was available, and installed smoothly in about twenty minutes.  There's an interesting menu entry that hints at additional bits of software--apps, I suppose we'd have to call them--but nothing is yet available.  The network supports internet radio in several forms and a nice favorites page will let you save the stations you like.  Denon also supports audio-only DLNA.  It did strike me as a little odd that there's no video DLNA support, but almost every receiver or TV does a terrible job with it.  I'm happy to stick with an external DLNA box.There's still more if you happen to have other gadgets floating around.  Apple's Airplay is supported.  As soon as I started streaming from my iPad, the Denon began to play it back (there's a bit of optional EQ to get around the worst artifacts of lossy compression).  I then used Bluetooth to pair with my iPhone and was quickly able to play back from that device.  Unfortunately, you'll have to control playback with the iPhone itself--there's very limited menu control in the Denon.  And finally there's a free app in the iTunes store that will let you use your IOS device as a remote.  I tested it and it works, but it's really hard to see the point of it.  The remote that comes with the receiver works perfectly well.While HDMI control between devices is an option, I should say that I had a few issues here.  I'd like to set up the system so that turning on my TV will also turn on the receiver, or vice-versa.  That works, but a little too well.  I've set a predetermined start-up volume on the receiver so that I don't wake up the house when I switch on the early morning news.  That works perfectly, as long as I turn on the receiver first.  But if I turn on the TV first, the TV will also ship its own volume level (maximum) down to the receiver in addition to the turn-on signal.  This is NOT pleasant and resulted in my turning off HDMI control.  I hope that a future Denon update allows a simple on-off-only mode for HDMI control.In summary, Denon's done a good balanced job of providing rich features along with very high quality sound.  I've got a receiver graveyard in the basement, but I don't think Denon is going there any time soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4BLCEDQ6M7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXTVPOE#wasThisHelpful","R1X4BLCEDQ6M7N","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never had a problem attractive hummers to a Perky-Pet feeder.  The streak continues with this midsize model.  I filled it and hung it up.  Within 5 minutes the Blackchins were investigating.  In another 5 minutes they were fighting over it.Assembly is quick, and this model follows the example of recent units in that the lower part disassembles easily for cleaning.  The wide-mouth top fill is a welcome addition and means that the sugar solution goes into the feeder instead of down the side.  The ant trap is also effective, but will need to be filled daily in our dry Western climate.I have only the smallest complaint.  As with other feeders from this maker, there's a little wire hanger taped onto the inside.  This is far too small to hang onto a typical cast iron feeder stand.  A larger wire loop would be a better choice.  Other than that, it's quickly become a popular addition to the back yard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0AGGO966LLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRJOVSY#wasThisHelpful","R1D0AGGO966LLA","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a gamer, but after decades in the field of audio I know my way around headphones.  I've been looking for an extra set of courtesy phones, so I thought I'd give these a shot. As phones for gaming or perhaps podcasting they're more than adequate.  For more serious listening they do fall a little short but that's not their intended market.  They're a little pumped in the bass and at the high end.  The bass is far from taut--it's a bit flabby--but for FX it's fine.  The midrange is a little on the murky side, but considering the price I've heard much worse.Gain on the microphone was surprisingly low and I had to raise my voice to get reasonable levels.  On the positive side, it did a good job of resisting wind noise, pops and sibilants.  I had no difficulty using this headset with my iPhone and iPad--devices the headset is intended for.  I must admit to a small amount of surprise that USB isn't supported, but as long as you've got a mini jack you'll be fine.The headset is quite light and should be wearable for a fair amount of time.  There is some questionable copy associated with the headset--""Acoustically Angled Speakers"" is a phrase with little meaning--but for general use these should do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MZSXETA56L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJGYA60#wasThisHelpful","R19MZSXETA56L7","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced a pair of accent floods with these LED lamps.  A few things were instantly apparent when I flipped the switch:  The color temp felt just a little warmer than the 2700K specification.  This is not a bad thing at all.  The lights were also a bit brighter than I expected--more lumens per watt.  And finally, the light didn't have hot spots.  With a number of LEDs, the light isn't well diffused and illumination is uneven.  With these, the illumination was quite smooth--perhaps even a bit better than the incandescent bulbs they replaced.It's encouraging to see LED quality going up at the same time prices begin to come down.  CFLs were a temporary solution that few of us will miss.  These bulbs are a good step in the right direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCIL4KHD4UBNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDZGFFQ#wasThisHelpful","RCIL4KHD4UBNN","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've just had the interesting opportunity to compare two different SSDs in the same system.  One--this Seagate--is ready to go.  Just plug it into a USB3 socket.  The other was a OCZ bare drive, which I placed inside a Thunderbolt enclosure.The test subject was my Mac Mini (vintage 2012).  This small machine is hampered by a 5400 RPM hard drive that really hurts its otherwise exemplary performance.  Using the Blackmagic disk speed test, the Mini's hard drive comes in with R/W speeds of 89/85 MB/sec respectively.  I applied the same test to the Seagate, which gave me read/write speeds of 418/398 and faster. This was appreciably faster than the OCZ unit, at the same time demonstrating that USB3 can easily perform as well as Thunderbolt in many situations.  It should go without saying that this little Seagate SSD has now become the system drive of the Mac Mini.For situations where large storage is needed, an SSD is not likely to have enough capacity.  But it's plenty large enough for system, applications and basic user data for just about any user.  And the difference can be quite surprising.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1USEG1T51PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6CVPVC#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1USEG1T51PR","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solid-state memory is rapidly taking the place of small-medium capacity rotating memory. This has given many users the change to upgrade the performance of existing machines without reverting to replacing the whole system.  Case in point is my Mac Mini (vintage 2012).  This otherwise very capable machine is hampered by a 5400 RPM hard drive that makes molasses look fast.  Using the Blackmagic disk speed test, the Mini's hard drive comes in with R/W speeds of 89/85 MB/sec respectively.I placed the OCZ package inside a Thunderbolt enclosure (made by Seagate) and connected it to the mini.  Read/write speeds jumped to 367/357 MB/sec--no small improvement.  I immediately moved my Windows virtual machine images to this drive.  There's no doubt about the improvement.I did not test the included Acronis disk-closing package.  I already have Carbon Copy Cloner (a very solid package) so I had no need to install even more software.In the review title, I mentioned that the speed--however great--doesn't break records.  On this particular mini, a Seagate SSD (USB-3, yet) bests the OCZ by a noticeable amount.  Still, you can't overstate the improvement that comes from chucking the old HD and popping in the OCZ.  It's worth mentioning that OCZ provides an adapter for installing this into 3.5"" drive systems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7FUEXGCMHBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4E2J32#wasThisHelpful","R2I7FUEXGCMHBS","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New Balance has quite a pedigree, going back to the original running craze of the 70s.  I've tried them from time to time, generally having some trouble with fit.  Although the shoemaker's 'last' is probably long gone, there is still a model foot that these shoes are built for.  They've always run a little on the narrow side for me.  With this 'D' width, I'm getting a better fit than I have before.The shoe is obviously built well, even though it's unfortunately following the garish clown-shoe look of recent years.  This is not an improvement over their older and more-restrained appearance.  Although I rarely run these days, I'm an inveterate walker.  A few miles on these shoes has not convinced me to change over from my Asics.  Lateral stiffness and support just aren't there, and the shoes feel a little squirmy.  Although there's no guidance on the product page, there's a distinct inward push on the front of the foot.  This would indicate that the shoe is more appropriate for over-pronators.  My pronation is pretty neutral and I found myself fighting the shoe with every step.I'll happily wear these shoes as general-purpose sneakers, but the absence of good lateral support keeps me from recommending them to runners or serious walkers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0PVWBJ29NV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8J6AFO#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0PVWBJ29NV2","AOMEH9W6LHC4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOMEH9W6LHC4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For Johnson, this book is a bit like an autobiography of her life as a reviewer.Johnson details her interests and strategy as a reviewer.

She clearly is devoted to this almost as if it is was a job, which I guess for her is kind of an apt description.As a coherent book, there are a few problems here. It seems like parts of the book are a little disjointed. She has some parts that explain her habits and thinking which are the strongest parts, there is a list of different milestones, and other parts are like a web FAQ where she answers questions.

"Disclaimer: The manufacturer provided this product to me to evaluate.This is an interesting and even a pretty fun product, but understand its limitations.The iGearPro USB Voice Recorder looks almost exactly like any other USB drive you have ever seen, and few would notice its extra features unless you pointed them out, or examined the device closely. If you look carefully you can certainly see that something is different but few will ever do this.The device functions as a regular USB flash drive. However, in several tests I found the write speed to be just over 1MB per second (this is quite slow). But that isn't why you would purchase this device, it is a very compact voice recorder and could work well as a simple tool to have in your pocket when you want to make a quick voice dictation for later. You simply flip the single switch, the device begins recording and stops when you flip the switch off.To play back your audio, or charge the internal battery, you just plug it in to any USB port on a computer and can access all of your recordings in WAV format easily loadable into almost any audio player.The device will work as a drive and for playback on a Mac (which I tested) but the simple utility program which sets the date is a windows only application. After a bit of time off of the charger, you have to rerun this utility again to set the time and date if you want this to be part of your recording. Otherwise all of your recordings were in January of 2000!The Sound quality is pretty good if you are holding the mic right to your mouth like a typical microphone, if you have it sitting on a table a few feet from you or from whatever you are recording, you get kind of a muffled sound. You can hear things, but they become less clear, and you'll need to crank up the volume on your device.Pros-Small stealthy recorder-Builtin rechargeable battery-Works pretty well for dictation-Compatible with many computing devicesCons-USB transfer speed is very slow, don't buy it for this!-The microphone is not great for noisy rooms, or many people talking, lots of room noise will be picked up-Needs to be recharged, probably daily if you want it to be ready to goRecommendation: If you need a simple always available voice recorder this is not a bad solution at all, just hold it close to your mouth. Alternatively, if you have a young teen or pre-teen that fancies himself a James Bond Junior, this could be a really fun gift. It is small, subtle, and easy to use.If you are looking for a high quality general recorder, or want to record music, you should look elsewhere and you will probably need to spend quite a bit more to get something good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BMS3AI01J1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZL75TG#wasThisHelpful","R7BMS3AI01J1V","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book may be a bit complex for those that are new to investing or don't want to get too far into the details. But if you want to understand how markets and investing work, and want to build a simple, sound, and low fee portfolio, the answers are here.Much of my love for economics and investing topics came from reading this book when it was originally published. I set my portfolio up using the principals outlined here and have made very few adjustments since. The advice I implemented has both saved me huge amounts of money in fees and earned me a market return that I am very pleased with.Some principles outlined in the book:-ALWAYS buy your investments through a very low fee investment firm (Bernstein recommends Vanguard, and I agree)-Did I mention that HIGH FEES WILL KILLL YOUR RATE OF RETURN-Most of your investments should be in highly diversified index funds-There are a few tricks you can implement that will make very slight improvements in your return (e.g. occasional portfolio rebalancing)-Active managers will win some years, maybe even several in a row, but they will never beat the market over an entire career, therefore you won't either-Getting a market return is a WIN-The guy on the other side of the transaction knows more than you do, you are playing with fire if you think otherwiseThe advice and concepts that Bernstein advocates are certainly not completely unique. He has been very influenced by Malkiel, John Bogle, and others. And much of the advice has become common wisdom now and followed by many. But there are many pitfalls for the amateur investor, Bernstein will help you to avoid them.I actually enjoyed reading this book, it is not just that the advice is important, it is well written and impactful. The book may seem a bit technical for some, but if you read and implement it, you will be  a much savvier investor than almost anyone else that you know. I could not recommend this book more and even though it was written in 2002, its advice is just as worthwhile today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHI87SEUL1Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071747052#wasThisHelpful","RYHI87SEUL1Y3","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DISCLAIMER: This product was provided to me by the manufacturer in order to allow me to review it. With that said, I was not compensated in any way for this review, and no promises were made that I would either review this product, or review it positively after receiving it. Please see my profile for more info.Product: ECSEM Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo EarbudsGeneral Impressions: The product is well packaged and probably looks pretty good on the shelf if you were to buy it in a store. It has a number of accessories, the most important being several sizes of rubber or silicone earbud covers so that you can size them to fit your ears. The biggest surprise to me is that functional bluetooth headphones can be produced and delivered for such an inexpensive price (on sale for $11 at the time of this review). They seem like an incredible value and the price point makes them barely more expensive than wired earbuds.The product also has an interesting design with the two pieces attached by a short cable that i have not run across before. It actually works quite well from a design perspective.Quality of Product: The quality is OK, it is not great, but not bad either. They seem like they would last a while, although one never knows how easy it would be to lose the rubber cups that fit in your ear or break the wire until it happens.The biggest issues for me with a product that I will be wearing in my ears for potentially hours is the comfort of the fit and the quality of the sound. I found both to be acceptable, but not great. Earbuds can have problems developing enough bass response to sound good, and these really lack a clear bass sound. They seem pretty tinny to me, very strong high pitches, pretty weak bass, and so so middle. There is also the issue of comfort. I listened to these for several hours straight listening to several familiar albums. My ears felt a little fatigued after the listening session.Issues: I have used a number of sets of Bluetooth headphones over the years, one issue that often comes up is the Bluetooth connection cutting out between devices. I had this issue come up a few times with this product.

Build-wise and sound quality-wise these are better, but they also cost three times as much money. I won’t be getting rid of my Buds, but I also wouldn’t loan them out to a teenager. I would have no problem buying this set of earbuds and giving them to a teen and not worrying what happens to them!Pros:-These are an unbelievable value.-They do the job, and would make a great gift for a teenager, or to have available as a backup set of earbuds.-Bluetooth pairing went very smoothly.Cons:-They don’t seem “expensive”, but of course they aren’t!-Somewhat more expensive headphones have a noticeably better sound quality and more comfortable fit.-Occasional Bluetooth connection drops.Protip:-Turn down the volume of your device before you start playing your music, it was shockingly loud at first until I could turn down the volume by about 30%.Final Verdict:I struggle with how many stars to give this product. In comparison to my Motorola Buds,these earbuds just aren’t that great, but they are SO INEXPENSIVE. The value angle is the main thing that ECSEM has going for them here.

"DISCLAIMER: This product was provided to me by the manufacturer in order to allow me to review it. With that said, I was not compensated in any way for this review, and no promises were made that I would either review this product, or review it positively after receiving it. Please see my profile for more info.Product: ECSEM Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo EarbudsGeneral Impressions: The product is well packaged and probably looks pretty good on the shelf if you were to buy it in a store. It has a number of accessories, the most important being several sizes of rubber or silicone earbud covers so that you can size them to fit your ears. The biggest surprise to me is that functional bluetooth headphones can be produced and delivered for such an inexpensive price (on sale for $11 at the time of this review). They seem like an incredible value and the price point makes them barely more expensive than wired earbuds.The product also has an interesting design with the two pieces attached by a short cable that i have not run across before. It actually works quite well from a design perspective.Quality of Product: The quality is OK, it is not great, but not bad either. They seem like they would last a while, although one never knows how easy it would be to lose the rubber cups that fit in your ear or break the wire until it happens.The biggest issues for me with a product that I will be wearing in my ears for potentially hours is the comfort of the fit and the quality of the sound. I found both to be acceptable, but not great. Earbuds can have problems developing enough bass response to sound good, and these really lack a clear bass sound. They seem pretty tinny to me, very strong high pitches, pretty weak bass, and so so middle. There is also the issue of comfort. I listened to these for several hours straight listening to several familiar albums. My ears felt a little fatigued after the listening session.Issues: I have used a number of sets of Bluetooth headphones over the years, one issue that often comes up is the Bluetooth connection cutting out between devices. I had this issue come up a few times with this product. It worked pretty well, but had a few noticeable dropouts during several hours of listening.Comparisons to Other Products: My main set of headphones is a set of Motorola buds. Build-wise and sound quality-wise these are better, but they also cost three times as much money. I won’t be getting rid of my Buds, but I also wouldn’t loan them out to a teenager.

"January 11-2015 Update:So I have had these cables for about six weeks. I started with a 4 star. Today I am dropping the review to a two star. I have five cables, two are in varying states of not really working anymore. They look great, but I have bent the micro side on one to the point that it no longer works and the second one will not stay in my phone, even though there is NO reason it shouldn't. Going forward I will look elsewhere for USB cables. Too bad, these are really cool looking cables. Oh, I should mention, I am not someone that is hard on my electronic equipment and cables, things usually last a long time for me.Original Review:Nice cable, could use a manufacturing tweakI both like and am a little annoyed with this product. I will elaborate on both. Build quality seems excellent. They are really nice looking and I love the retro braid in the cable. The thing that annoys me is the micro side. I have ordered a number of these and have got what appear to be quite different versions and I can't tell you why because I don't know why. If you look at the attached picture you will see three different Micro B connectors. The one on top is a generic cable. The two on bottom are both 9 to 5 cables. As you notice the bezel on the two is substantially different in size (the smaller bezel is a 6 foot, the larger is a 10 foot, I also have several 3 footers and they all have the larder bezel). I have four different 9 to 5 cables ONE is small the others are all the larger bezel. In some devices, especially with a protective case, you will find that this larger bezel might prevent your device from charging. This is a potential issue and you just have to try it and see. I would prefer it if all of the 9 to 5 cables had the smaller bezel.Pros:-Cool Retro Look-Nice build quality-Usually works as it shouldCons:-May not fit your device well if there is not enough space where the USB cable connects or you have a case, cover, or bumper attached","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5334BRM89Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7HJZFA#wasThisHelpful","R3E5334BRM89Q3","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been watching Boardwalk Empire since the series began. This is just a great story, told by an amazing writing/directing team, with top notch actors.Sadly this is the last season and a somewhat short one at that. Eight instead of the usual ten episodes. This season fast forwards into the future a bit over season four, but also offers some insights into Enuch and Eli and their childhood origins. Very interesting stuff.The show is great but one criticism I will offer, I normally purchase the standard definition versions on Amazon Prime. They are both cheaper, and I have never yet noticed a single artifact that made it obvious that there was a difference. Not so with this one. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the HD version. There are many noticeable and obvious artifacts in the SD version. I cannot tell you if this is HBO's fault or if it is Amazon's, and I should also say most people won't notice, but I did.One positive I will give HBO here. I love several of their series, but it is often very difficult to purchase an HBO show in a timely manner. I still had to wait until the season was over, but the whole season was released just a few days after the season ended. I would still prefer to get these weekly as the show is played, but the current situation is much better than waiting a full year which has been the prior pattern.It is a little baffling that HBO and so many other companies have been so slow to recognize that people will purchase their shows with real money instead of pirating them if they are just given the opportunity to be honest. So this is an improvement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYTPW2OJ9O73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPIXKG4#wasThisHelpful","R1HYTPW2OJ9O73","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BoxWave sleeve does the job it is intended for, but feels a little cheap (well it actually is cheap, so I guess that makes sense).Background, I have had my Nexus 4 for almost two years.

Things were going along swimmingly until our last ride on Space Mountain at Disneyland where the pressure from the seat restraint cracked the back of my found in a lovely spiderweb pattern.

"Tiny, affordable, fast. This is a high speed Class 10/UHS I card that I purchased to go with my new GoPro camera. The most difficult part of buying flash memory is understanding the speed of the cards and what the designations mean.In the older speed system cards were measure on a class 1-10 basis with 10 being the highest. Added in to the mix is the new UHS designation which has to do with the bus speed. Many UHS-I cards are available, and I am starting to see UHS-II cards too. All else being equal, I would recommend always buying the fastest card you can for future proofing. Memory has become pretty cheap which is great, it wasn't that long ago that I can remember people bragging about their 1gb flash drives! Now it seems to be a race about speed, and while you may not think that this is important, HD video is becoming a very common video format, this format eats up space, and demands speed. Many cameras will not work with slow memory, or your burst or recording format options may become very limited.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8VN1NK258VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVPU7AO#wasThisHelpful","R1H8VN1NK258VL","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is a Keurig, and works as expected.Three things you should know about Keurig's:1. The newer versions have some kind of detection system designed to prevent you from using NON-Keurig K-Cups. Personally, I find this behavior in a company abhorrent. I chose this model because this new ""feature"" wasn't included.2. Keurig coffee is INSANELY EXPENSIVE. It is, without exaggeration probably 90% cheaper to buy raw coffee and use a non-K-Cup coffee maker.3. The coffee is good, but NOT great. In taste tests around the internet you will discover that the coffee produced while ok, is not by any means great. Keurig's are not for someone who is a connoisseur.For great Coffee go in this order: 1. Good quality Espresso machine, 2. Coffee Press, 3. Good quality drip coffee machine, 4. Everything else including Keurig.So why buy a Keurig? They are convenient and easy to keep clean. I purchased this device for use in a staff lounge to allow many users to utilize it, so far it works great.

"Love this device. Synology has by far the best webmin interface I have every used. It is practically like running a full desktop, yet runs completely in your browser. Their software is top notch and VERY fast.This is the first Raid I have owned, but I have owned other NAS devices before.I did a great deal of research in choosing which Raid to purchase. Unfortunately, I missed one little thing that was important to me. There are other Synology Raids that are aimed at media/video serving roles. These models have a somewhat more powerful processor so that they can transcode video. They also allow for the installation of the Plex Media Server which is way better than the standard Synology media server. All of my video is pre-transcoded, so I didn't feel the need to spend the money on the more expensive media version. I didn't quite catch that Plex would not run on this version. This is at least partially my fault, but it is a bit hard to tell when reading about on the web. My solution which is working fine, is that I do have my Synology holding and serving all of the media files, but I have continued to run the Plex server on my Win7 machine. This adds a bit of network overhead no doubt, but it has run beautifully. I would love it if they would deliver a version of Plex that ONLY serves files and does not transcode.If you are planning on doing a lot of video serving, your should probably go with the more powerful Synology devices.The device is built well, the software is top notch. I do feel that it is pricey, but I was willing to pay it for the security that adding a Raid device adds to the protection of my files. I have files on my computer going back almost 20 years. I have a cloud based backup, but I really wanted a second backup that I was in control of, the Synology provides this backup as well as serving media files.I have Mac, Windows, and Linux devices on my home network. The setup process is quite different for each, and so far it works well with all three. I will tell you there is a bit of a learning curve here, and it wasn't always obvious how to go about making connections between devices. If you are on Windows download the Synology Assistant which makes adding network drives MUCH easier. There is a version of this app for OS X, but it seems to be less featured, and connecting to my Mac was much more involved than the Windows setup. I would like to see some more work on this app.PROS:-Amazing Webmin interface-Once setup works very well for backup and file serving-Small and convenient to hide in a closet-High quality case and hardwareCONS-Kind of expensive-Arm version does not support Plex-Setup is not for users who do not know what they are doing-I get some dodgy connections with my Macbook (it works then it doesn't, no explanation why)I would buy Synology again, and probably will, though doing it over, I would probably get the more powerful processor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWKN8GO1C28E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6PCTCG#wasThisHelpful","R1UWKN8GO1C28E","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This didn't come with anything but the bracket which I guess is fun, but most mounts come with bolts and accessories, this one doesn't, be prepared.The other surprise I didn't expect is that my SSD did not really fill out the bracket. The bracket is really designed for a regular 2.5"" HD, not what most SSD's actually look like.So how to solve these problems... Zip ties and washers. It doesn't look super pretty but it is solid and works fine. I could not have used actual screws because my SSD and the brackets holes were not lined up, but the zip ties made that point moot.

"I have done concrete before, and if you haven't the first thing that you should know is that working with concrete does to your body something like what a professional boxer does to a punching bag. It is a lot of lifting, kneeling, being on your knees, and generally feeling like you've been thoroughly pummeled. If you have never done it before, seriously consider asking an experienced friend for help. If you can afford to hire this out to a pro, you will probably be glad you did!That said, with careful planning or doing a little bit at a time, you can make this work. As others have said if you are doing many of these, either borrow, rent, or buy a concrete mixer. They are not that expensive and are well worth it for making the job more tolerable. If you are just doing a handful, a shovel and wheel barrow will do fine. I already own a cement mixer, and I am putting 80 of these in, so you know what I am using!Concrete will set up differently based on the amount of water you put in, and the amount you ""work"" the concrete. While I have put in several slabs of concrete, I have never poured it into molds, so this is a bit of a new one for me. The molds work great, although they are not super strong. We broke one before I poured the first square, fixed it with a piece of duct tape which is still working fine!If you follow the directions on your concrete mix it will probably be too dry and look very rough. You will likely need to add a bit more water, but go easy on it, it should be wet but not soupy. If it is too wet, it will not hold up on its own once you pull out the mold. If you are doing many of these, I suggest that you start in the place where the look is least important and make a few till you get the technique down, then go gangbusters. I find that I can do about six of these in 90 minutes, if someone else is helping.When we are done we will acid stain and then seal them. They should look very nice and last many years. My only regret right now is only buying two. I wish I had at least three if not four, but I am making a lot of squares!Update: October 15, 2014So we are done with the project now (except the final acid staining and sand). It went pretty well, but there is definitely a learning curve here! The ones that I liked the least it turns out are the squares that were a little on the dry side. It was hard to get them to finish right and I had to redo some chunks that crumbled. By the end of our project I was pretty good at this and could usually get the look that I was going for.Figure out a process that allows you to be productive and quick. I did the following:1. Level my molds (stick an old piece of tile or something flat underneath the edges of two or more molds, so that they are level.2. I would mix two bags, pour them out into the molds and spread the concrete.3. Mix two more finish filling the first mold.4. Mix two more, flatten the tops with a trowel, take the first molds off, and set up for the next set of molds.5. After your concrete is starting to setup I would use my trowel to smack the molds to give the concrete some texture.6. Repeat until you are done pouring for the day.7. About 20 minutes after I was finished pouring I would use a broom to lightly wipe the tops of the concrete to give it a little broomed texture. This looks nice and decreases your chance of slipping when they are wet.Pro-tip: If you are doing a lot, have your local home store deliver the concrete. It doesn't cost that much and will save you MANY trips to load and unload the concrete yourself. I had two pallets worth dropped in our front yard and wheel barrowed them in three at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32V2XSL25SMMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KKR8ZK#wasThisHelpful","R32V2XSL25SMMD","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PLEASE SEE MY SIX MONTH UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEWI want to give this five stars, but I can't. I pre-ordered this from Roku the day it was announced. It is pretty much exactly what I wanted, most of the features of the Roku 3 (which I LOVE), but in a small package that can be hidden behind the TV and powered by the USB port. You may know that Roku took an earlier stab at this with a device the required an MHL port (kind of a super HDMI port), this meant it only worked with some TV's and the device never took off.I don't know if the very inexpensive Google Chromecast was the push that Roku needed to try to get the Roku Stick right, but sure enough they are back with a device very similar to the original stick but that uses USB and HDMI, instead of the MHL port. So far so good... It should work with any TV that has an HDMI port, but there is no Ethernet so make sure your Wi-Fi is solid.I received this in the mail today and immediately started setting it up. This process took much too long compared with my setup of the Roku 3 a few months ago which was easy and FAST. I had some trouble getting the device to connect with the remote (I think it was confusing my Roku 3 remote and the newer Roku remote, I finally took the batteries out of the older remote to ensure they didn't stomp on each other).With the remote connected, I moved onto Wi-Fi, it connected to the Wi-Fi but would not connect to the internet. After going through all sorts of attempts and settings, I decided to hotspot to my phone to see if that would work, and this allowed me to run the Roku updates and load in the channels. After the software update was complete, I connected back to my regular house Wi-Fi and all was well! So this must have been some kind of issue with the combination of the initial Roku Stick software and my network.After the network was updated then it was on to setting up the individual accounts (Netflix, Amazon VOD, and iHeartRadio being the important ones for us). So I would love to know why Roku does not store the login information and transfer it to all of my devices? (UPDATE: In the comments to this review it was mentioned that Roku does not store ANY of your account information to protect your identity. This is plausible and likely true, but it would be nice if setting up a new device was simpler.)But no, you have to do this manually. Going through this process brought me to the thing that I am really worried about: the response of the remote sucks, it sticks, it lags, and sometimes you are waiting a long time for it to catch up with you. I cannot EVER recall waiting on the Roku 3, at least in regards to responding to commands from the remote.The last concern I have is the size of the stick and it's fit in the TV. I didn't imagine this would be an issue, and hopefully it won't turn out to be, but when I installed it in the back of the TV, the fit was very tight and there was noticeable pressure put onto the USB cable and the HDMI connection. I am hopeful that this will not cause any issues going forward and I may look at moving it to a different HDMI port to see if there is a better fit, if you encounter this problem, you may want to look at getting a short HDMI extension to avoid putting undesirable pressure on the device.The Good:-Roku's software and interface are the best I have used, and this is exactly like the Roku 3-Streaming quality seems to be very good thus far-I've tested all the services we use, and though the setup was tedious everything works and the quality is excellentThe Bad:-The installed software that needed immediate updating has issues-Initial setup was NOT smooth (I have done this before, so it should have been!)-Device response to the remote can lag a lot (this may be the thing that ruins the stick for me)This device is BRAND NEW, so I am willing to be a little patient with Roku, hopefully as they roll out more updates in the next few weeks some of the issues will be worked out, the remote lag is a MUST fix. People will abandon a device that seems flaky (this is why I am getting rid of my Apple TV's). I am kind of surprised that all of the reviews so far have been almost completely positive, at this point I am a bit disappointed when comparing this to my Roku 3.After a few weeks and hopefully some updates, I will revise this review, I am hopeful that I will be able to add more stars, but the jury is out on that until I have lived with the device for a while.UPDATE: October 15, 2014 My Almost Six Month UpdateI have not quite given up the device (we still use it all the time). However, if I were making this purchase now I would not buy the Roku Stick, I would buy another Roku 3. It turns out that the Roku Stick has a MUCH less powerful processor than what is in the Roku 3 (a device that is almost a year older). The specs were not released until after the device was on sale as far as I can tell. Were this device to have the power of the Roku 3 (maybe next year!) I would recommend it.A few issues and work-arounds:-Start-up is SLOOOOWWWWW. I initially had it powered by the USB port on my television. This meant waiting at least a minute from turn on time to watching a show. Way too long. What I have done instead is powered the Stick from a regular power outlet and the USB power supply. This means as soon as you turn on the TV it is ready to go.-It has periodic crashes, mostly this just means it won't do anything. So at least weekly restarts are required. While many people are used to this these days it shouldn't be this way. I restart most of my computers at most once a month and often I go months between restarts. The Roku should be less fragile than it is (the Roku 3 IS less fragile).-The Netflix app, in my opinion, is too demanding for this device. This is particularly noticeable when rewinding a video (at least at 1080p) which is essentially impossible. It just doesn't work. You lose control of the remote and the rewind just doesn't work. I am considering moving this to a 720p TV, it may work better with a smaller fire hose of video attached.-Amazon VOD in contrast to Netflix works pretty well on the Roku Stick. I have far fewer issues with Amazon, so if that is your primary video source, maybe this isn't such a bad idea.-I use this on a 1080p TV with a FAST connection to the internet. Once the video is playing, the quality of video and audio is EXCELLENT. It looks great, and once it is rolling everything is fine as long as you don't want to do a quick rewind (which won't work).-I had an issue with the device not fitting well into an HDMI port. I switched it to a different port, fortunately my TV has several, and it fits fine there, in the comments several people mentioned that you can buy (and maybe request from Roku) a small HDMI extension cable if it will not fit in your TV. I didn't need to do that, but some people might need to do so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWCQ5DYDZF2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INNP5VU#wasThisHelpful","R3TWCQ5DYDZF2O","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We plugged the device into our home network, registered, and ported our number, that did take a few days to finalize and we have been going strong ever since. We did pay a bit extra for the upgraded package, this works out to around $13 a month. Call quality is excellent, at least as good as the phone company. We would highly recommend this to anyone, so long as you have a reliable internet connection. One weird thing that I noticed, when you answer the phone there is just an ever so slightly long delay before the person can hear you. I usually say ""hello"" twice, they hear me the second time. After that there is never any perceptible delay that I have ever noticed. The voice mail feature is outstanding and you can have it forward voicemails to your cel phone, e-mail, etc.The Great:-Call Quality is Excellent-You can use all of your old phones and wiring-It is MUCH CHEAPER than the phone company-Call forwarding-You can take the device with you and plug it in to any network (My in-laws do this multiple times per year)The Not So Great:-You really need a decently fast and reliable internet connection-Short delay on beginning of a call-You probably need a bit of networking knowledge to make the install go easy","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167PE7K6K34HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O3W4LE#wasThisHelpful","R167PE7K6K34HA","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems indistinguishable from the Apple original. We purchased this to replace a misplaced original charging cable. So far it is working perfectly and we couldn't be happier.

"Installed this on a rental. We are probably just at the edge of the usable range for this antenna to the local TV towers, and yet once installed it worked perfectly to bring broadcast TV in in all its HD glory. This was an easy install that we attached to an eave on the side of the house so that we could take it down later (which we already have done after moving).It was a very easy install, just a couple of screws. If you don't have existing wiring probably the hardest part will be running the COAX to your TV. We had wiring to piggy back on so the install was a piece of cake.

"We were doing a construction project, so what the heck, lets add a wine cellar too.After doing a bunch of research it became clear that Gold's book was the best choice. It was recommended by many reviewers. I read the book thoroughly and incorporated a cellar into our construction plan. Reading the chapter on the vapor barrier and insulation are critical if you are going to pull off a passive wine cellar. Moreover, I wouldn't even try to go passive unless you are building mostly below ground.It is fairly obvious that the cooling systems that are available for non-passive wine cellars are problematic and extremely unreliable, so passive is best.In our situation we had a mostly below ground basement level. We bumped up the insulation on the inside and added some outside as well since the building was already trenched. We also added a vapor barrier. The room so far stays very cool even though we aren't quite done. There is also a whole chapter about how to construct the perfect door. It turns out that it is almost impossible to buy an adequately insulated door, but it is not that hard to build one yourself if you are handy enough or can hire a contractor.If you are looking for a prestige wine cellar to show off and impress people with, be warned that Gold is pretty negative about these, and won't help you much there, this is about storing and protecting wine, and Gold doesn't care too much about impressing people. He does offer some great advice about how to build your own effective shelving system and how and where to buy wine that are quite insightful.If you are building a wine cellar, get this book, and maybe one for your contractor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7C2PLAWKDIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024FB1H0#wasThisHelpful","R1P7C2PLAWKDIT","A167OM57QB4H2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A167OM57QB4H2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(This review is based on the uncorrected/unformatted PDF version from the author's site, along with the Kindle preview of the finished book as I'm still waiting for my physical copy to arrive)For anyone starting to learn about biology, getting a grip on the spatial and temporal dimensions of things going on in cells can be a challenge. Some things happen incredibly fast, others are surprisingly slow. And even after you come to know the names and functions of many of the molecular species found inside cells, there are lots of questions about numbers that suggest themselves. Just how many ribosomes are there in a typical cell? How long does it take to transcribe DNA to RNA and then translate it into protein? How many photons does it take to make a cyanobacterium? etc. Along the way we learn other interesting facts such as that there are estimated to be 100,000,000 times as many virus particles as there are human cells in the world.The authors have been compiling interesting numbers about biology at their web site www.bionumbers.org for several years. Now they've produced this book which explores many numerical properties of cells. How many, how fast, how much energy, how big, etc. They perform back-of-the-envelope calculations and walk you through coming up with answers to many fascinating questions.This book would also serve as a good, if somewhat less formal, introduction to the field of physical biology.In any case, it's a fun and enlightening read that will have you thinking about cells in new ways as you begin to attach some concrete numbers to the conceptual ideas of traditional molecular biology. I very highly recommend this book to anyone learning, or simply interested in, the workings of the cell.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0J5P2N9DF3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176VY3UI#wasThisHelpful","RZ0J5P2N9DF3U","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is horribly designed. In order to get the physical product to work (rather than the in-app-purchase version) you have to hold a paper ""passport"" card up against the screen. Yeah, you heard that right, not hold it up to the camera, but up against the screen of the phone itself! How is this even supposed to work? Of course nothing happens, there's no feedback, and according to the View Master site, it may not work at all with phones that are in a case and/or have a screen protector installed.I'm sorry, but I'm supposed to destroy my screen protector and disassemble my case in order to try this? I don't think so.Fortunately the other reviews suggest that the experience isn't all that great even if you do get it to work.IF you want to try out this product then *don't* buy the physical version. The in-app-purchase version is the same price and you won't have to jump through the impossible security hoops. You won't get the AR feature, but honestly that seems rather pointless anyway since it's VR not AR that is the goal here.Disappointing.So far all my phone-based VR experiences with Google Cardboard or similar have been horrible unpleasant blurry/grainy pixelated experiences.G.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TI3CQQUJIWRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EG5HII#wasThisHelpful","R1TI3CQQUJIWRR","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work really well. I used one on a really dusty car dash and it ended up looking like new!The fluffy part does have a sort of pocket into which the handle inserts, so the plastic isn't scraping on everything you're dusting.They absorb quite a bit of dust and dirt, but I don't find them that reusable so they're not cheap but they are very effective and for many of us that will justify the cost. You pretty much just run them over a surface and ALL the dust is cone in one swipe.The refills seem dry, so I think there's less worry about them drying out the way the Swiffer floor products can over time or if you don't get the lid back on.The separately available extension arm is highly recommended for getting at all those cobwebs, but then you'll be able to use it everywhere and will probably go through a lot more of them!

"After buying an OtterBox Commuter for my 6s+, I've now had a chance to try both the Defender and this Symmetry model, as well as the Symmetry case for the regular 6s.The Symmetry cases are nice because they're a single piece made of two kinds of plastic molded together. This gives them the benefit of a more protective rubber frame and internal structure, plus a harder plastic back that supports the whole thing. As a result they're the thinnest/smallest of the OtterBox cases that I've tried and the dual-material molding is a more advanced technology than their traditional multi-part cases. The back of the case is solid plastic with no opening over the Apple logo as their other cases have.The Symmetry case has no flaps over the connectors, with openings for speaker, mic/headphone, lightning, and the silence switch. The up, down, and power buttons are covered by the rubber case which has raised rubber areas to push and requires slightly more force than the bare phone would.Installation is pretty easy, just a matter of pressing the phone into the case. Getting it back out is a bit harder due to the rigid back of the case that makes it hard to bend away from a corner of the phone. All the OtterBox cases seem to like to hold on tightly to your phone so you really don't want to have to swap cases frequently.No screen protector is included with the Symmetry cases (the Commuter comes with a very basic plastic stick-on protector and the Defender has a thicker plastic screen cover that's part of the case).It fits the 6s+, and supposedly is newly designed for it, though it feels almost like this is still a 6+ cover that happens to squeeze in a 6s+ well enough. Once in the case, the rubber case edge ridge is only a millimeter or two higher than the surface of the screen. It's ok face down on a flat surface but you would want to be careful with any rougher surface. I'm not as impressed with the fit of this case on the 6s+ as I was with a Symmetry case for the smaller iPhone 6s. The Symmetry 6s case is my favorite so far for that phone, but on the 6s Plus, it doesn't fit and look as nice and I really think the case needs to be just a bit thicker. Much of this may just be the proportion differences on such a very big phone. On the smaller 6s, the Symmetry cases feel awesome, but on the big 6s+ proportions are such that it doesn't feel as adequate.It's still very nice and should provide good protection for a very slim case. I had higher hopes though for this one though, and I've put my phone back in my OtterBox Commuter case for now. If you have a 6s, then the Symmetry case is an absolute winner. On the 6s+ however it just feels like not quite enough case for me and I prefer the slightly bulkier Commuter version.I'm going to say 3.5 stars rounding up to 4. As thin cases go it's still nicer and probably more protective than most even if the case does seem just a touch smaller than it should be.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Y55OS77FSRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7TLAD0#wasThisHelpful","R28Y55OS77FSRQ","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The whole family has been loving 3.0 and the Start Wars figures. We have 1.0 but never picked up 2.0, so there's a lot that's new for us and the game really seems more polished and there's a lot more to do now than there was back in 1.0.The 3.0 software lets you play with the 1.0 and 2.0 characters, but does not include any of the older play sets, so you have to start up with the older software versions when you want to revisit the old worlds.These games really capture the Disney experience, and Disney is making the most of their intellectual property now that they own practically everything as you constantly run into mini-characters from their vast and diverse catalog.The 3.0 game would be worth it just for the toy box hub activities and things like your own interior home that can be expanded into a huge labyrinth of rooms, hallways, secret doors, etc. and each room can be extensively customized as you unlock designs and items. This mini-game alone can keep just about anyone occupied for days.Note that there are going to be *three* Star Wars play sets for 3.0 it looks like. One comes with this the regular starter edition.This review is for the XBOX 360 version, it looks and plays great. Maybe there's something in the XBOX ONE version that would make it more worthwhile, but if you're still on the 360 and not planning on upgrading this Christmas, then this is a great game to get and will breathe some more life into your old console.Great fun, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE6WLVHXQNNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ0Z17Q#wasThisHelpful","RJE6WLVHXQNNP","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OtterBox has two relatively new case lines, the Symmetry and MySymmetery. Both have single-piece multi-material moldings with a plastic back and rubber sides that wrap around the front of the phone.This is one of the My symmetry cases where the back of the case is clear, and you can either leave it that way to expose the pack of your phone, or put a patterned insert in the window to give it a different character. The inserts are paper and opaque, printed on coated heavy card stock, and each case only comes with one. I think it would have been nice for them to include an assortment of backs with each case.You can also print and cut out your own customized backs, and you can get PDF templates to help with this at their web site at http://www.otterbox.asia/myotterdesign/The case feels very good in the hand and fits the iPhone 6s well. The plastic back is smooth but not overly slippery, and it has a good tactile feel as it's slightly flexible and not rigid or brittle. The up/down/power buttons are completely covered by the rubber part of the case and rubber buttons are provided which will increase the force required to activate the buttons a bit. The mute switch, headphone/mic, Lightning connector, and speaker are all uncovered by openings through the case.The phone feels well protected. Not as much as the more serious OtterBox cases, but better than your average case. The [My]Symmetry cases are the most compact and give the best look and feel of all the OtterBox models. Yes, there's less overall protection, but the advanced multi-material moldings really help simplify things compared to the older multi-part cases.Note that the [My]Symmetry cases do not come with any screen protector so you'll probably want at least a basic plastic screen protector to go with this case.4.5 stars rounding up to 5.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140DAAJRO4BE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53SX08#wasThisHelpful","R140DAAJRO4BE2","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried three different Otterbox cases for the 6s and 6s Plus so far, two of which I bought, and this one that Vine offered me to test.This is the Defender, the classic Otterbox design that offers the most protection of any of their cases. It consists of an inner two part rigid plastic box that snaps together around the phone which has a sealed window over the hole on the back that you see the Apple logo through, and a sealed screen protector that's permanently part of the front half of the inner case. The hole in the screen protector for the home button is covered with a thin rubbery material to let the Touch ID work while still keeping the display sealed. It's not waterproof as the earpiece/front camera, speaker, rear camera, and microphone are all exposed, but it could save you from drops and splashes that almost all other cases would not.The screen protector is smooth thin plastic that still lets you transmit pressure to the screen. It does unfortunately look like a plastic layer over the screen and detracts from the beauty of the naked iPhone screen (as do all screen protectors to some degree). I've seen some people talk about using a heat gun to remove the built-in plastic screen and using a separate tempered-glass screen protector. But honestly if you want the protection that the Defender provides, then you're already giving up some convenience and aesthetics, so you might decide just to live with the plastic screen. It does not in any way limit what you can see and do on the phone.A rubber shell covers the back and sides of the inner box. Getting this off the first time is a bit of a challenge as it comes around the front and seats into a channel that goes around the front of the bezel so you have to pry it up and out of the channel before you can peel it back around.The rubber shell has flaps that seal the headphone, lightning, and mute switches. The mute switch one is rather a pain to open and get at the tiny switch, so if you like being able to easily switch into and out of silent mode then this may not be the case for you.In addition, there's a large rigid black plastic cover that snaps over the front and serves to completely protect the front of the phone. This has a large plastic spring-loaded belt clip directly in the center that rotates 360 degrees, snapping into 12 detent positions. For the 6s Plus and other huge phones, this ends up being quite a beast of a case arrangement and will be a challenge to wear on a belt without looking completely ridiculous. But if you want a belt case, this is a good option (also check out http://tuff-as-nuts.com/ for really nice custom leather cases, but again it's tough to pull this off with a phone so large).So let's compare this to a couple other cases, the Otterbox Commuter and the Otterbox Symmetry.The commuter Is a two-part case with a rubber inner case that wraps around the phone and a rigic back that snaps around it. It does not have a window over the logo opening on the back (it's open) and it comes with a very ordinart plastic adhesive screen protector with no covering for the home button. It does not have the belt-clip cover. There is no door over the mute switch so it's much easier to access (still fairly recessed though). When you hold the Defender you're touching the slightly tacky rubber outer case so it has a pretty good grip. With the Commuter, you're holding the  hard plastic back on the sides so it's more slippery. Overall it's a lot more compact while still providing much better than average protection.The Symmetry is a very interesting and somewhat more high-tech case than the other two. It consists of a single piece that is molded as a hard plastic back with an inner honeycomb pattern rubber backing which also comes up and around the bezel. It comes with no screen protector whatsoever. It's the smallest of the Otterbox cases and looks and feels really good. If you want a minimal type of case then this one will probably provide more drop protection than any of the typical cheap ""skin"" cases.All three cases cover the Up/Down and Power buttons completely with the rubber part of the case, and require a bit more pressure to activate as a result.The Defender however is clearly among the top choices if you are really worried about damaging your phone's screen, or if you need to use it in a more rugged environment. It's not small and will make an already slab-like phone into more of a brick, but for some that will be completely justified by the added peace of mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP97M957J8AXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SXR0K#wasThisHelpful","RP97M957J8AXC","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Feels very rigid and stable, even when standing on the top step. The size is excellent, giving you about a ten foot reach which is enough for pretty much any indoor task (that you'd want to stand on a ladder for) and even some outdoor work. It's large enough to solve most ladder-requiring problems, yet small and light enough to store anywhere and carry up and down stairs without breaking your back or smashing it into everything.Convenient enough to grab each time you just need an extra step to reach that top shelf, and tall enough to change all those pesky ceiling mounted light fixtures, install and remove draperies and other window treatments, and effortlessly reach all those cobwebs.There's a mostly gravity operated latch that holds the top step down when opened up, and requires almost no effort to unlatch when you're down and ready to fold/move the ladder.

"These are pretty good. Think dark chocolate compressed brownie with some broken pieces of cashew nut pressed into the surface.The pictures on the box show big chunks of dark chocolate and piles of whole or half cashews, but neither are much like anything you'll find inside the wrapper. The nuts looks like they started out as reject crumbs and broken pieces from a regular cashew packaging line. I've never found a piece larger than an eighth of a nut so far. There's nothing like a cashew ""layer"" in these, nor do the nuts seem to be mixed directly into the chocolate flavored bar. It looks like they just sprinkle a few nut crumbs into the bar mold and they end up pressed into the surface of the bar.So somewhat disappointing from a nut point of view.The chocolate part of the bar holds itself together well so it produces a relatively low amount of crumbs when you eat one. However the bars are a bit prone to having pieces of cashew fall off the surface of the bar as you're eating.The taste is fine but nothing I'd reach for as ""candy"".

There are a couple almond ones with a whole almond on top, and one with crushed almonds on top but otherwise no noticeable nut texture or chunks or nut inside.The packaging is excellent, with multiple layers of packaging to open. It came in an outer brown box with a form-fitting insert holding the get and brown slip-case candy box, inside of which was a red-paper wrapped inner package and ultimately a clear plastic-wrapping on the box with a custom tray and a 1/4"" springy paper pad on top of the actual chocolates.The outside of the package has a narrow vertically-oriented booklet attacked with 10 pages describing and identifying each type of candy that's included in English and French.Most of the varieties have two pieces each, but there were about four which were unique.Included were (if my memory is correct):Simply Almond x2 - Smooth dark chocolate praline topped which a whole crunchy roast almond.Avelotte Caramel x2 - Hazelnut cream with a hint of caramel.Velvet Bliss x2 - Hazelnut praline coated in milk chocolate.Dark Lemonnette x1 - Rich cocoa center with a hint of lemon.Gianduja x2 - Hazelnut cream with silky milk chocolate shell.Cocoa Dentelle x2 - Foil wrapped, intense notes of cocoa subtly blend with lightly-roasted nuts and crispy wafer pieces.Almond Caramel x1 - Soft caramel with a hint of salt in a dark chocolate cup with almond crumbl on top.Intense Dark x1 - Intense dark center coated with crunchy dark chocolate shell.Triangle Crisp x2 - Milk chocolate triangle, lightly roasted almonds and crispy wafer.Creamy Cup x1 - Creamy center inside a milk chocolate cup.Excellent.A note on shipping: The box arrived with no protection other than the outer brown cardboard packaging, and was left leaning up against our front door by UPS. The candy was fresh and in perfect condition, but as nothing was done to ensure that it remain refrigerated (or even cool) during shipping, if the sun had been on the front of the house and the package had sat there in the sun for very long then things might not have turned out so well.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLEH7CTWXKOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGKP4#wasThisHelpful","R3SLEH7CTWXKOL","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very interesting survey of the effects, both known and speculative, that quantum mechanics has on the micro-world of the cell and the resulting effect it has on Biology.There are two main reasons I think that people get interested in ""quantum biology"". The first is that at the scale of the cell, QM is going to dramatically affect the way chemistry happens. I think traditionally biologists have tended to just assume that these effects get abstracted into the behavior of the molecules so they don't need to think about them outside of areas like trying to design proteins from scratch and so leave such topics to the quantum chemists to deal with. But the topics discussed in the book suggest that maybe QM is adding into the behavior of the molecules in a way that you can't easily ignore, and that by considering the quantum mechanical effects you will be able to go deeper into understanding the interactions between molecules inside cells and thus reach an understanding that would not be possible otherwise.The second reason people get interested in QM is because they're looking for some ""magic"" to help explain how life is somehow special, or they want to find a basis for consciousness and self-awareness that is magical enough to fit with whatever philosophy appeals to them.There is much that is speculative in this book, but it's all at least grounded in the current science, so it's a fun read and give you a lot of things to think about.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5NRBTKL5TC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307986810#wasThisHelpful","R3F5NRBTKL5TC3","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This seems to be one of the best review books currently for the NCLEX. My wife is going to be taking the test in the next few weeks and has been using the Kaplan review and study materials. She also took the Kaplan four day NCLEX prep class, which was mostly about test-taking skills, but then they send you off with a plan for content review for 6-8 weeks before you take the test. All of the question sources like this and the old NCLEX 4000 software seem pretty good, but she has been disappointed in the reationale contant of the Kaplan online practice tests and rill questions when compared to the NCLEX 4000 software.But until you take the test it's really hard to know what's the most useful.

"This is a complete system that does not require a computer/phone, but will also let you stream video and interact via iOS which is pretty cool.The camera is pretty small and has a very broad pan and tilt range, so it should work pretty much anywhere you can place it on a high enough vantage point.The remote and the camera are powered using the same micro-USB power charger (it comes with one for each). The remote is rechargeable so you can take it anywhere within WiFi range, and beyond that you can use your iOS device wherever you are.The remote display has a fold up antenna (usually seems to work fine without it folded out), and a metal stand tab that folds out from the back to prop it up.Overall the quality feels very good, though not as absolutely rock-solid as one might expect from the Motorola brand historically. The display interface is touch-based and can be a little fiddly. It's got a completely proprietary user interface so it takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, but you can pretty much figure it out by messing around with it. Volume of audio in both directions is adequate, but not booming.If you don't have the remote turned off completely it starts beeping if it loses the signal from the camera.There's a micro-SD card you can record to, but the process to do so is a little fiddly going through the menus.You can (in theory) buy a second camera to work with the system so you can monitor two locations without relocating the camera.Overall the video quality is excellent and the night-vision works well. The pan/tilt response is rather typically laggy and sometimes moves more than you'd like but generally it's quite controllable and lets you get it pointed where you want without too much trouble.There seems to be no provision for an earphone/headphone.If you want an expandable all-in-one monitor this one seems to be about as fully featured as you can get.

"This is another of those breakthrough books that popularizes recent discoveries in science, and in this case it's doubly exciting because it's introducing an area of health science that is directly applicable to everyone, AND it's something that (unlike say your own genome) you can actually do something about today.I would put this in the same category as some of my other favorite science popularization books like Chaos: Making a New Science and The Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease, and Inheritance, books that really open your eyes and let you in on things that are on the cutting edge of discovery.From its cover the book looks like yet another fad health and diet book, but don't let that fool you, this is a science book first, written by two researchers at Stanford who are working to unlock the secrets of the microbes that live in your gut, and they tell the exciting story of our new understanding of their complex behavior and how they interact in very complex and highly evolved ways with the rest of our bodies.They suggest that through our western diets and other effects we have been killing off the diversity of our intestinal biome and that this may well be directly associated with many of the new epidemic health issues like gluten sensitivity, obesity, diabetes, etc.The science is fascinating and you'll discover that there's an entire universe of complex life living inside you that you probably never imagined.While there's far more yet to discover than has been unearthed so far, the authors feel that there are things we can do today to promote a healthier and more effective microbiome in our guts, and to that end they offer practical advice on diet (including recipes) to keep your tummy critters happy and healthy.It's great stuff that everyone should read and I give it all possible stars.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHASG1OP1MO0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594206287#wasThisHelpful","RHASG1OP1MO0W","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice little portable USB 3 drive. It's molded into a reasonably rigid plastic box with a slight texture to it as shown in the product photo. The plastic is not super thick, so if you squeezed the case hard enough you could pinch the drive inside, so probably best not to store a bowling ball on top of it, but otherwise it should be pretty rugged.I was not able to take it apart or otherwise determine exactly which physical drive is inside and whether it's using drive-integrated USB 3 or whether there's a separate interface board. I suspect from the size that it's using one of the newer drives that has USB functionality mostly built into the drive itself.The only opening into the enclosure is the USB 3 Standard B jack. The drive gets power only from the USB interface, and will work with USB 2 or USB 3 ports. It comes with a USB 3 A to B cable that's about 18 inches long. There are basically no instructions or documentation other than a photo of plugging the cable into the drive and a USB port, plus some disclaimers in a couple dozen languages with a note that it you want to know what the warranty is or anything else that you should go to Seagate's web site. The box it comes in is not too much bigger than the drive itselfThe drive was NTFS formatted out of the box, with a usable capacity of 2,000,396,320,768 bytes or 1.81 TiB. The drive comes empty apart from a Seagate setup program that I didn't run because the drive worked perfectly out of the box under Windows 8.1 on my laptop.Doing a full backup of my Windows 8.1 laptop with a 256GB SSD over USB 3 to the drive using Acronis 2015 took about 40m and copied 152GB of  data to the drive for a throughput of about 60MB/sec. Copying a 5GB movie from the laptop by dragging it from the Windows desktop to the drive went at 52MB/sec. Copying it back from the drive to the latop the same way went at 122MB/sec.""Ejecting"" the drive from Windows both unmounted it and powered it off before it was unplugged.It's virtually silent (I can't really hear it at all in a quiet room) and has only a very slight vibration when spinning.There's nothing especially epic about it, but so far it has worked perfectly out of the box and performs well, so I like it.By the way, this drive has a capacity 362,000 times bigger than the first hard drive I ever owned, and per byte it's more than seven million times cheaper.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXMLMVHYWA3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKFEE5S#wasThisHelpful","R3OXMLMVHYWA3U","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This series of toys isn't quite as well done as some others we've had, but it's still pretty fun.The way this one works is that you place Frank against the fence at the top, and then launch the included Lightning McQueen up and around the bend where he hits a lever while going around the top. The third time you do this, the fence drops and Frank rolls forward a few inches to block the track and knock down the ramp which flips into the path, allowing you to launch Lightning once more and he will go up the ramp and jump over Frank (and fly off the back of the set) to ""escape"".You have to hit the launcher button almost as hard as you can to get Lightning to make it around the track. When you don't quite hit it hard enough, he will roll backwards and get diverted around the side path where he causes the little tractor to ""tip"" momentarily.When Lightning does make it around the track he comes down nose-first against the launcher, so you have to pick him up and turn him around for the next launch.That's about all there is to the operation of the set, and after a few times it will probably get boring and the kids will start to explore alternative play ideas, so I think there's limited long-term potential here. This is one in a series that can be connected together to build larger layouts with interchangeable launchers etc. To some degree you can mix and match parts.So 3.5 stars, rounding up to four here.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYG666FV7Z6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYWGFME#wasThisHelpful","RWYG666FV7Z6A","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once broken apart, the edges don't feel like perforation at all. They have a slightly rough edge, but I've had professionally made cards that felt about the same. It's more noticeable when you have a stack of the cards, but when holding one card it feels excellent, and I would have no worries handing these out that they will come across as unprofessional somehow. The thickness is exactly what I'd expect and want in a professional business card, not too thin that they feel like paper and not so thick that you can't fit more than a couple in a wallet.The color ""ivory"" is a light cream that adds a nice touch to the design of your cards. If you want pure white then you want a different product, but if you like a little extra warmth in the result then these are great.I ran them through a couple of Epson all-in-one printers that have a pretty tight paper path and they survived fine, though if your printer has a single-feed / straight paper path then that's better as these are relatively heavy card-stock. Check the back of your printer to see if there's a fold-down single-sheet feed feature as many printers have these, but many people will never use them as they never knew (or forgot) that the printer has this feature.They took the ink fine and the results look good. The ability to print both sides of the cards opens up all kinds of design opportunities. I like to have my regular business card info on the front, and then offer some technical quick-reference information on the back that gives people a reason to hang on to the card and keep it handy.Excellent product.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SWLNZ3QMRXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XPHB#wasThisHelpful","R17SWLNZ3QMRXP","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm comparing this book (MB) to Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC), which is probably my favorite textbook of all time.This one (MB) is not as much of a general cell biology book as it primarily covers only the elements of the so-called ""central dogma"" of molecular biology. DNA replication and transcription into RNA, and RNA translation into protein, plus all the regulatory aspects of those processes (as well as chapters on the cell cycle, DNA repair, transposable elements, and genomics), unlike MBoC which spends more or less the first half of the book on those topics and then devotes the second half to the further biology of the Cell, covering things like membranes, energy conversion, cell signalling, cancer, and the immune system.Both books do a good job of introducing the Biochemistry you need in order to understand what follows. MB has a great first chapter that gives an overview of the book (basically ""Molecular Biology in 30 pages"").Where MB shines though is in its more in-depth coverage of the topics it touches on. It devotes about twice as many pages to these topics as the current edition of MBoC does. MB is also wonderfully illustrated and does a good job of visually explaining things. MB contains lots of ""experimental"" panels that talk about how various aspects of the cell were discovered.Both books include chapters on techniques for manipulating the genetic material in cells. I thought the current edition of MBoC felt slightly more up to date, but both books are very current editions with a good overview of the current state of the art.Both books are quite readable. I would give the edge to MBoC here in terms of ease of reading as MB seems just a bit denser to me. But both are very easily understandable.I can highly recommend this book (MB) to anyone looking for an in-depth coverage of the central themes of molecular biology (how DNA and genes work). It goes pretty deep for a first course, but it does not presume much of any background knowledge so it would be an appropriate book to introduce someone to the subject who wants to understand things very thoroughly.If I had to choose only one or the other I'd still prefer the new MBoC edition due to its much broader coverage of cell biology (it's also 50% larger and twice as expensive though), but this one is really excellent at what it covers. I bought it after previewing the ""Look Inside"" pages and I have not been disappointed.If the mechanics of the functioning of cells interests you then you'll probably be fascinated and really enjoy the depth of knowledge you gain from this book, and it's something you'll want to keep and probably use frequently as a reference if you progress further in the study of biology. If you find the details tedious, then this one might be more depth than you want, and something like Essential Cell Biology, 4th Edition might serve you better.Currently this book is not available as a Kindle ""Print Replica"" e-textbook yet, where the other titles mentioned here are.Really happy with the book, easily a 5+ star experience.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPRNXHT9HVQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199658579#wasThisHelpful","R1DPRNXHT9HVQB","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The salad spinner works well and is not fussy about the lid mating with the basket, etc. There's a brake button to slow the rotation to a stop after spinning. The outer rim of the base has a rubber ring that helps keep it in place on the counter when in use. It works but could be a little grippier than it is.Once spun, you can take the spinner top off, take out the basket of greens, wipe out the bowl, dump the greens into the bowl, and then attach the mandolin lid and use it to add sliced and grated ingredients to complete a salad. The mandolin holder/handle/safetyguard has four prongs to hold the thing you're slicing/grating, but it only pushes down to the last 1/4-1/3"" or so (resist the temptation to run the last couple slices across the mandolin blade without using the handle!). There are three interchangeable blades for the mandolin. A regular sharp mandolin slicing blade, and a medium and small grater attachment. The lid also has a course grater/grinding surface as well that's separate from the mandolin itself. the interchangeable blades are nice, and it allows you to store the sharp blade where fingers won't get to it accidentally (the two blades not in use go into slots behind the slot for the active one).Once you're done you can server the salad in the bowl, and there's a plain lid for the bowl to save the leftovers for later. It all sounded a bit gimmicky at first, but it all actually works pretty well and clean-up isn't too bad.

"I remember back in 1996 or so when Java was new and people had been talking about it for a while but I had yet to put my hands on it. That all changed because of two things. The first was the release of Symantec's Visual Cafe, a $99 Java IDE for Windows that was just incredible, and the publication of the first edition of Java in a Nutshell by David Flanagan. While much of that book was also spent trying to document the (then manageable) Java API, the magic of the book was in its concise description of the Java language and the programming examples in subsequent chapters.Over the years I've bought each edition of the book, but I've always looked forward more to the language description and examples in order to get up to speed with new features than to the quick-reference material, especially as the volume required to cover things even at a high level became unmanageable. So I for one am happy to see them jettison the mostly useless API reference section of the book.Now nearly ten years (seems hard to believe!) after the last edition of the book David Flanagan has apparently moved on, but new author Ben Evans has done a good job carrying forward the legacy and holds true to the spirit of the original.The book is written for Java 8. There's no separate ""What's new in Java 8"" section, so those looking for that specifically might be better off looking elsewhere. But for a new Java programmer or someone wanting an up-to-date introduction to the language, this book remains an excellent choice.I would have no hesitation in pointing someone to this book as an excellent way to get started learning the Java language or to keep for the working Java programmer as the authors describe it, ""sitting faithfully by your keyboard as you program"".G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG1WPWGAVRU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449370829#wasThisHelpful","R1RG1WPWGAVRU8","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my door the only issues I had were that the door did not have the recessed in-cut for the bolt plate (requiring chiseling out the door frame to make it deep enough to fit well) and the new frame-side strike plate also needed a small bit of frame chiseled away, and mounting it was tricky as the old screw holes were just a bit off from where the new plate wanted to be, requiring filling the old holes and then drilling new ones. Neither of these issues reflect badly on this lock set of course.Installation is otherwise quick and straightforward, and everything needed was included (9v battery for example).You can program in quite a few additional lock codes, which makes it convenient to grant temporary access to a new user and then later be able to revoke that access without everyone else having to learn new codes. There's no key (which might be considered a plus) and if you find yourself locked out with a dead battery then there are a couple metal studs on the outside that you can touch a 9v battery to in order to power-up the lock so you can enter your code and get in.The lock/unlock thumb-turn on the inside is actually just connected to a microswitch that connects into the lock electronics. However the inside lever will always open the door, even if the thumb-turn is in the locked position (and opening the door in this way does not change the position of the thumb-turn, i.e. if the door was locked it will remain locked after you exit).The lighted keypad is a nice touch, but there's essentially no tactile feedback from the keypad so opening the lock in poor visibility or with gloves can be a bit tricky. Not a good choice for someone with poor vision I think.There's no access log or other way to communicate with the lock.The electronics are all in the outside half of the mechanism, though the battery goes in the inside half. There's a wiring harness that connects the power and thumb-turn state through the door.The body of the lock is fairly thick, around 7/8 of an inch on the outside, so the door handle will probably protrude more than a simple key lock set would, which you should keep in mind if you have a screen or other door outside the one you install the lock on to make sure there's enough clearance.Overall the look and feel is really nice, and the mechanism feels good when it operates. My only complaints are that the 9v battery backup access mechanism is a bit weird (potentially having to drive to a store and buy a replacement battery before you can get in) but perhaps better than always needing to carry a key as a backup, and the lack of tactile feedback on the buttons could be improved on I think. So 4.5 stars rounding down to 4.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F669GRPNR9QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N12FCOS#wasThisHelpful","R3F669GRPNR9QP","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the ""Problems Book"" that goes with the sixth edition of Molecular Biology of the Cell. Doesn't sound all that exciting does it? But actually the problems book is just as fascinating and informative as the textbook it's a companion for. And there have been enormous improvements over the previous (fifth) edition here too. I've been working my way through the new edition of MBoC and loving it, and just got around to taking a look at this new problems book and WOW.The problems typically start out with an interesting fact and then ask you a question about it that will require some creative thought. The background information provided for each question is often fascinating and goes into all sorts of areas with detail that there isn't room for in the main textbook. Here's an example question from p.6:""1-45: Giardiasis is an acute form of gastroenteritis caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia lambila. Giardia is a fascinating eukaryote; it contains a nucleus but no mitochondria and no recognizable endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus--one of the very rare examples of such a cellular organization among eukaryotes. This organization might have arisen because Giardia is an ancient lineage that separated from the rest of eukaryotes before mitochondria were acquired and internal membranes were developed. Or it might be a stripped-down version of a more standard eukaryote that has lost these structures because they are not necessary in the parasitic lifestyle it has adopted. How might you use nucleotide sequence comparisons to distinguish between these alternatives?""In the previous fifth edition, a CD-ROM was provided with the book that included PDF chapters of the answers for each problem chapter in the book. This was inconvenient at best. But now for the sixth edition all the problems AND all the answers are printed in the book. You get over 400 pages of problems followed by another 400+ pages of answers, so you can read and think about a problem and then flip to the answer to read their explanation. This gives the printed version of the book a significant advantage over the Kindle version in my option, since it's much easier to flip back and forth in a physical book than it is in the Kindle reader app (if only they could provide active links between the questions and answers...)The answers are as extensive as the questions, and provide lots of additional interesting information, history, etc. The answer to question 1-45 above takes up half a page and includes a paper reference.There are several styles of problem. Each section contains one ore more of the following: basic vocabulary (match the term to its definition), True/False questions, Thought Problems (as the example above, and there are lots of these), Calculations that ask you to figure out some (usually fairly simple) quantitative value to illustrate some fact about the spatial or temporal world of the cell, Data Handling questions that present information in terms of experiments and then ask related questions, Medical Links questions that connect the basic science more to human clinical practice, and new MCAT style questions that consist of a passage of text followed by questions.There are plenty of illustrations and diagrams, some repeated from the textbook and others original, in both the problems and answers sections.The book is now printed in color and this greatly improves the usability of the book and its figures, and it substantially improves the look and feel of the book overall.If you want to see more before you decide to buy you can get the first 47 pages or so via the Kindle Preview option if you have a tablet or PC/Mac Kindle reader app. The answers are all in the second half of the book so the preview will just show you more questions as well as the front-matter of the book. The Kindle version is a ""Print Replica"" so it's an exact reproduction of the physical book (like a PDF).Besides the Problem Book's own questions and answers, it also includes answers to all the end of chapter questions from the main textbook.This book is as much a source of new knowledge as it is a way to test your knowledge of the subject matter in the textbook. You can think of it as another nearly 1,000 pages of fascinating molecular biology presented in a Socratic style. Like the textbook itself it's extremely well written and very approachable, and is one of those rare ""wow"" book experiences.It's great if you want to learn and think more about cell biology (and life in general), as well as its applications to human health, and even if you've just been assigned this as an additional book for a class using the main textbook then I think you'll really enjoy it.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTHDZSUQ79GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFMK2HS#wasThisHelpful","R1MTHDZSUQ79GV","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very good functional headphones that also work great out of the box (driverless) in Windows 8.1, which lets you have one pair of headphones that you can use on both platforms.Battery life is good (they claim 10 hours and a micro-USB charging cable included), audio is good as well as voice quality through the extendable mic.Operation is relatively simple without a zillion controls. Power is switched on and off by holding down the center of the back of the left ear cup. This button also serves as a mute switch and there's a red/blue LED in the mic to indicate when you've muted it, though even with the mic extended it's pretty near the edge of your visual field. Pressing the button while wearing the headphones produces a loud physical button pop which is annoying. If you make frequent use of the mute function then honestly I'd recommend you look for a different headset.Volume is a simple old-fashioned knob at the back of the left ear. A Mode button is the only other user-interface control and it switches between two modes. There is a line-in jack for connecting directly to an audio source so you can use it as a wired headset as well.The USB transceiver module is pretty long so you would probably not want to use it with a laptop.The blue lighting is at least a good reminder that you've left them turned on. Otherwise they probably mostly serve to reduce battery life. If you like the look then they look great.Overall they're simple and work well and are more flexible than average in terms of supporting connectivity to multiple gaming and audio platforms. They're in the medium to heavy range for height of headphones, though we've worn them for extended periods without excessive fatigue. I don't really find them to be awesome in any particular way and they're not the cheapest option in this functionality range, but they have held up under heavy use for the last 30 days with no problems at all.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY1UIWM0A2VPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5YYXM#wasThisHelpful","RY1UIWM0A2VPZ","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is based (mostly, see update at the end) on the Kindle edition of the book, which is a ""Print Replica"" edition which exactly matches the printed textbook (it's essentially like a PDF of the entire book). For textbooks, even the most valuable (like this one) that I love and plan to keep for a long time, I now much prefer electronic versions for many reasons, not the least of which is that it's easier to hold up and read a tablet than a seven pound tome. You can also zoom in on text and figures as needed, and the illustrations are almost all in ""vector"" form meaning they stay sharp and detailed as you zoom in. You can also search the complete text of the book, do electronic underlining, set bookmarks, etc.Yes, the Kindle textbooks have DRM that restricts what you can do with it, but I find the Kindle restrictions less onerous than many, and in most cases they give you an option to ""rent"" textbooks for the duration of a class which might be as economic as buying a physical copy and then reselling it when you're done with it. But if you want complete freedom to resell what you buy, or maybe you just like the feeling of holding a real book in your hands, then the printed copy would probably be what you want. Note that I believe the physical version comes with a disc containing the movies and supplemental materials for the book (turns out it doesn't, see update below), but you can also find all of this free on the Garland Science web site if you buy an e-book version.So with that out of the way let's talk about the book! There are basically two groups of people who are likely reading this. Either you've had this book assigned as the textbook for a class or you haven't. If this has been assigned as a textbook, first make sure you're looking at the correct edition. This sixth edition is very different from the fifth (the authors point out that five million scientific papers were written since the previous edition) and you might *not* get away with buying a cheaper used previous edition. If your class is going into enough depth that it needs this book over something like Essential Cell Biology, 4th Edition then chances are you really do need the correct edition. Also the sixth edition is brand new as of this writing, so make sure you're not being asked to get the previous (fifth) edition!This is one of my favorite textbooks of all time. A really good textbook is designed to prepare students to be practitioners in a field, not just to try to keep bored students awake and hold their hands through a class they really wish they didn't have to take. This is a great textbook and it's THE book to get if you want to learn as much about cell biology as is possible from one volume. It's also now entirely fresh and up to date (as of 2014), something absolutely critical in a field like Biology which advances daily. Everything in here is fascinating. If you think this stuff is boring then I feel sorry for you :) Life is cells, and this is ""everything we know about how cells work"" so it's directly applicable to an understanding of every (known) form of life, from bacteria to you and me. Even if your class doesn't go down into the depths and fine details, this is a great book to have for later self-study if this stuff interests you. This can be a textbook you keep for years and refer to frequently.This is also a surprisingly accessible work for those interested in learning about modern Biology on their own. If you're someone who is scientifically minded and wants to understand how life works, then most of what's in here is easily comprehensible and highly enjoyable. Unlike many fields, there aren't years of prerequisites needed to start the study of cutting-edge Biology. If this were Physics, you would need to have had ten years of math and boring low-level physics before you could ever hope to begin to understand things like quantum mechanics or the general theory of relativity. But there's no math requirement for understanding Biology (though it's starting to become more quantitative and newer fields like Physical Biology are growing rapidly). A little knowledge of concepts from Chemistry is helpful, but again very little of the discussion in this book is quantitative so there's generally nothing to calculate, no equations to solve, etc. Cell Biology is much closer to something like computer programming in terms of the mental aptitude needed to understand it. To get started I recommend reading chapter 1 thoroughly, then read chapter 2 but if your eyes start to glaze over then just skip the rest of chapter 2 for now (the chemistry, while obviously fundamental and critically important is not necessary to understand deeply in order to understand the rest of the book, just as you don't really need to understand voltages and transistors in order to learn to program a computer), and then read Chapter 3 thoroughly which is all about how proteins perform most of the work in the cell including acting as microprocessors, motors, pumps, etc. By that point you'll likely be hooked and you can go back and appreciate the rest of chapter 2 when you're ready for it.So how does this Sixth edition compare too the Fifth? Well, first of all it has been seven years since the previous edition, which is nearly forever in the world of Biology, so just on that basis alone the new edition is going to be a big advance. In general the fundamentals are the same, but the fine details of understanding have advanced a great deal.An ongoing problem for the authors is the incredible volume of knowledge that exists and the near infinite and subtle complexity of even the simplest cells. This means the book could easily be three times its current size, a pressure which the authors must find a way to resist if the book is to remain portable and affordable. In the fifth edition, the book exploded past its covers and the standard edition was forced to relegate the last five chapters to PDF supplements (a huge Reference Edition with over 1600 pages was available with all chapters printed, and the e-book versions include all chapters). This was not a popular decision as it meant that even after buying and lugging around a big expensive tome, you still didn't even have all the content printed.The sixth edition now includes the entire content of the book, and there's no need for a ""Reference"" edition. This means however that even though the printed book has gotten slightly longer, they have had to shorten the effective size by about 250 pages! This has resulted in a lot of editing and a reduction in the number of figures. In some cases this means more effective and concise content, but in other places interesting material and in-depth discussion has been eliminated. Taking as an example chapter 4, Control of Gene Expression, the current edition has 79 figures where the previous edition had 115. Also the chapter on Sexual Reproduction has been eliminated entirely (you can download the fifth edition version of this chapter as a PDF, see the update below) though some of its material has been integrated into other parts of the book.I cannot help but wonder if the authors have really made the right decision here. Choosing to reduce the (effective) size of the book by around 15% at a time when knowledge in the field is growing so rapidly seems rather limiting. I would personally have rather seen them embrace the idea that many of their readers will be using e-books where the length has no physical effect, or even consider breaking the book into two volumes as is often done in fields like the study of medicine. But in the end this is still intended to be a textbook, and many students will likely appreciate anything that reduces the number of pages they have to read :)A lot of work has been done to clean up the design, and they have re-created many illustrations in a more consistent style. This edition uses a pleasant blue theme in comparison to the reddish-pink of the fifth edition. It has a cleaner look overall, and I think the changes in title/heading color are a definite improvement for on-screen reading. There are a few places where figures include small areas of white-on-lime-green text that I have to zoom in on to read, but generally the changes are improvements.The content in general has been brought up to date with many sections extensively updated or re-written. Interestingly, as a sign that classic quantitative methods from Physics are starting to creep further into Biology, there's an extended section in chapter 8, Mathematical Analysis of Cell Functions, which gives some mathematical (ZOMG! some math in a Biology book!) treatment to things like gene product equilibrium and gene regulation and serves as a good introduction to the field of Physical Biology, which is another interesting way of approaching the study of life (if you find this interesting then I can also recommend Physical Biology of the Cell which I bought and have been enjoying).Anyhow, MBoC gets all the stars as being one of those magical books that takes you deep into a whole new and fascinating world, one where you'll learn how each individual cell in your body has much more in common with a modern supercomputer than it does with that soggy old frog you dissected in high-school. The practice of modern cell biology is nothing less than hacking into alien computer systems (not designed by the mind of man) looking for technology we can appropriate or adapt to cure disease, reduce world hunger, produce clean cheap energy, and otherwise improve our lives.An exciting book for exciting times.G.Update: I've now purchased a copy of the physical book as well, just because I like it so much. It's a six pound, 13 ounce tome that's two inches thick. It's hardbound, and has the same feel and quality as the Reference edition version of the fifth edition. Paper quality (thickness, brightness) are again similar to the fifth edition. It's definitely not as lap-crushing as the old Reference edition (that extra pound or so makes a big difference).The physical book does NOT come with CD media for the supplemental movies and stuff, so you need to go to the Garland Science site to find them (under the Student tab you can search for the movie numbers from the book without needing to create an account, or you can create an account and add the book to it to make accessing things a little easier). The GS site still seems to be rolling out information on the new edition so at some point they may have a page/site dedicated to the book as they have for some other recent textbooks. They have also now added a downloadable PDF of ""MBOC, Fifth Edition - Chapter 21: Sexual Reproduction: Meiosis, Germ Cells, and Fertilization"" in the sixth edition downloads area. This chapter got eliminated from the sixth edition (the meiosis section in the Cell Cycle chapter was extended a bit to compensate) so this is a useful reference to have.Update 2: I just picked up the new version of Molecular Biology of the Cell 6E - The Problems Book and it's got many VERY nice improvements over its previous version. It should really be considered ""part two"" of the textbook. There's a huge amount of additional knowledge in here and it's great to just read, not just as a workbook.

"The GT1 is a 440-470MHz FM transceiver. It's about the size of a typical FRS/GMRS radio. Small, but not tiny. The hardware feels great and looks good the radio has a very clean design and seems very well constructed. It comes with a drop-in desk charger, a single mono ear-piece with a Mic and PTT blob on the cord, a screw-attached belt clip (plastic clip but the attachment plate is metal as are the screw holes on the radio, so it seems very secure), hand strap, rechargeable battery, and a ""manual"" in a nice box well packaged. It uses two (three contact I presume) jacks for Mic and Speaker (and programming).So, this is a  Bofung, ok ""pofung"" (Bofung seems to be changing their branding) radio. That means of course that the manual is relatively worthless so expect to be on your own to google up what you need to know to use this radio. Actually the manual isn't as terrible as it could be, and manages to cover some of the operaiton of the radio at least.There is no display. You get a green/red RX/TX indicator, a white LED operated by the button below the ""MON"" function button which acts as a flashlight (on) or repeating S-O-S Morse code blinker, MONItor (bypass squelch) button, PTT button (hard plastic, short throw, positive click, feels pretty good), power/volume knob, and a 16-position rotary channel selector knob (which stops at each end of its travel so you can tune by counting clicks if you need to). There's a recorded voice that tells you ""power on"" when you turn it on and will speak a number from 1 to 16 when you change the channel knob. The channel number is spoken only when you settle on a channel, so going from 1 to 16 does not speak all the numbers in-between unless you pause at each one.If there's no channel activity then there's absolutely no way to tell if the radio is on or off without pressing MONI or wiggling the volume knob or something. Easy to forget to turn it off. There's supposed to be a low-battery alert tone and blinking TX indicator but I haven't experienced it yet.Unfortunately (and why I can't give the radio more than two stars) the radio is mostly unusable out of the box because you have no way to program it. You will need to obtain the proper programming cable and software (no indication of which is the correct cable in the manual or where to get the software). Of course if you know anything about baofeng radios you probably already know you're going to need the two-prong to USB cable (in a form actually supported by the operating system you're using which seems to be a tricky issue at the moment) and you'll want the free CHIRP radio programming software, because everyone says the baofeng software is rubbish. Unfortunately as of this writing, the radio is so new that CHIRP does not list it s a supported radio, and neither does the official baofeng software web page as far as I can tell. This is likely to change before too long, but today you may be out of luck accessing any advanced feature of the radio like, oh, I don't know, actually tuning it to a frequency of your choice.The radio apparently comes programmed with 16 frequencies in its 16 channels. What are they? Your guess is as good as mine, since the manual doesn't tell you. (Could they be set to US (or Chinese?) FRS/GMRS frequencies maybe?) Since the frequency coverage is so broad, chances are that some of the channels might be outside the US ham bands, and if so there's pretty much no way to use the radio out-of-the-box without breaking US federal law. Even inside the ham bands, it's probably not legal to transmit if you have no idea what frequency you're on (hardly can be said to be in ""control"" of your station). So if you want to buy a couple of these and use them as walkie-talkies and don't mind the use probably being illegal then they would probably work for that purpose, but you might find you're transmitting on a local emergency service (Fire, Police, etc.) channel and they might not take kindly to that. In addition, the FCC is an agency with little sense of humor and they issue fines in multiples of $10,000, so you really don't want them mad at you.So for many users there's just no way I can recommend this thing. However, if you're a licensed ham, and you don't mind waiting for programming software and the need for a separate cable (that might cost as much as the radio lol) then OMG! It's LIKE $20! They're practically disposable! And once you get over those hurdles you might love the thing.As soon as I get hold of software that can program the thing, I'll be back to update with some actual performance experiences. Until then, two stars, the second only because the quality seems really impressive for the price.Most users would probably be much better off spending the extra $10 to get one of the models with a display/keypad where you at least have some hope of being able to use it without needing additional hardware and software, like the Baofung UV5-RE for example.Update: I found my channel 4 is the output of a taxi dispatch repeater or something similar (GMRS conceivably?), so I can give some reception information. The signal from this repeater is good, though it's not enough to break the squelch of the radio so I have to hold down the monitor button to hear anything. The Red/Green TX/RX led however will glow in proportion to the received signal even when the squelch is closed which is nice. IF you have the monitor button pressed, then channel changes don't take effect until you let go of the monitor button (at which point the radio will speak the new channel number. This is annoying because you can't just hold down the monitor button and click through the channels to manually ""scan"" them. You have to go one at a time, let go, wait for the voice, etc.Audio is good and quite loud through the built-in speaker. Even at its minimum level, the volume is sufficient for listening in a quiet room.Some notes on charging: The drop-in charger has guides that need to line up with and mesh (which they don't always do) with the battery (which allows you to charge the battery either on or off the radio which is nice). There is a green LED on the charging base that turns red when charging and turns off after three hours of charging. The radio itself has no indication (and probably no idea) of charging. The charger is labeled Input: DC 10V, Output DC 8.4V 500ma. The actual input is 120V AC line via a captive cord with an non-polarized plug. There is no (correct) indication of what the actual input voltage range is, and there are no UL or CE registration/certification marks on the charger (you might not be able to take it into the EU with you when traveling if customs should notice, but it might not work on 220V anyway).There turn out to be a few radio functions you can configure via tuning to a particular channel, holding down MONI and PTT, and turning the radio on. The ones documented in the manual are 1-5,10,11,15 and 16, but some others appear to do *something*:1-5: VOX operation speaks ""vox on"" or ""vox off"" alternately (number = VOX gain sensitivity? (guess)) default=off6: no apparent effect7: no apparent effect8: Toggles unknown option, speaks ""on"" or ""off"" (default = off)9: Toggles unknown option, speaks ""on"" or ""off"" (default = off)10: Toggle voice prompts on/off (default=on)11: Toggle ""Emergency Alarm"" feature on/off (receipt of signal from compatible radio triggers alarm? (guess))12: No voice prompt when activated, power on beep, then TX/RX light turns and stays red (possibly transmitting?), no controls have any effect. Powering off returns to normal. Test mode? Baby monitor mode?13: no apparent effect14: no apparent effect15: Change voice prompt language (toggles between English (default) and Chinese)16: turn SCAN on and off.G.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5FAGA49JHJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OR2H01O#wasThisHelpful","R1R5FAGA49JHJU","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is good as a ""missing manual"" kind of book. If you're the sort of person who misses the days when software came with a big printed book that basically listed all of the features of the program and what each option did, then you will love this book.If you're looking for a book that will teach you how to be creative and how to become good at things like retouching photos, then not so much. There's very little creative advice in here. If you know you want to select an area of an image for some reason then this book shows you the tools and options to do that, but it never tells you why you'd want to be doing that selection in the first place.There are a few short sections that lean more towards creative issues, like Chapter 17: Ten tips for Composing Better Photos, but this is simply five pages of really basic photography advice like ""use the rule of thirds"" and it's not even about Photoshop Elements at all.As Dummies books go, it's nicer than average being printed in full color, about an inch thick (~425 pages).As a manual replacement it's probably worth four stars, but not many people these days want to sit down and read a user's guide from  cover to cover. As a ""How To"" book, I would only give it one or two stars, and if you want a book that will really teach you WHAT to do and WHY you're doing it rather than just HOW, then I think you can do a lot better.

"These are very hard and dense and the dog (who normally demolishes every other form of dog treat in about three seconds) has to really work at them for a while. He'll run downstairs with it so you can't watch him struggle with them.They claim that if you give one of these to your dog each day it's the same as brushing his teeth twice a week (at the same time they tell you that veterinarians recommend daily brushing). I really don't have enough experience yet to say whether this is the case, but based on the effort the dog goes through in breaking them up I could believe it, and I'm tempted to get a couple boxes and see what the vet says after a month or two.While various product literature suggests the existence of a ""large"" size of these, only ""mini"" and ""small/medium"" appear to exist currently. These are so hard and dense that I wonder if when scaled up to large they would be just too hard for all but the most powerful dogs. The mini size is recommended for dogs 5-34 pounds.Because of how hard they are, I would hesitate to offer these to any dog who already has dental issues, as I would be afraid they might be too painful to chew.But these are the first ""dental"" dog treat I've seen that really seem like they might accomplish something.Four stars for now and I'll update if we get more experience with them.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPUFB2Q6IS5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTTDWG#wasThisHelpful","RNPUFB2Q6IS5L","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want to know about birds then this is THE book. I've never seen anything like it. If you're a bird fan then just stop reading and buy it, seriously.There are two approximately equal parts to the book. the first consists of nine chapters that tell you pretty much everything you could ever want to know about birds in general, starting with their origins and evolution, 64 pages on anatomy and physiology, flight, food and feeding, bird society and populations, breeding, where do birds live, migrations, and birds and humans.These chapter s go very deep into details and reading through them has answered pretty much everything I ever wondered about things like bird migration, how they survive in winter, and all aspects of behavior. All the little questions that other books never quite went into enough detail to answer. The book is easily worth its price just for this part of the book alone, and is pretty much the ultimate single reference work. I don't know how you could pack any more information into the same space, and it's a LOT of space.The second half of the book is a catalog of all the bird families, and for each family there is a really impressive amount of detail describing the behaviors and other attributes that make that family of birds unique and interesting.Most bird books and field guides are disappointing in that they try to catalog by species since the user will see a bird and want to look it up and read about it. The problem is that there are so many different bird species that even covering just the common or local ones in a reasonable amount of space means room for only a sentence or two about what makes this species different. So you have a big book and look up a bird and you end up with an unsatisfying amount of information. This book however has both the space (318 big pages) and by documenting at the family level you get a page or more (five pages and five pictures for ""Hawks, Eagles, and relatives"" for example) of detailed interesting information that's applicable to any member of the family.There is both a subject index and a bird families and names index that lets you look up birds by common name and scientific name for the individual species mentioned in the book.The author's English has a Welsh and English bent and occasionally uses analogies or comparisons to common British things that may be unfamiliar to those who are not from there. Overall the book is very readable, especially the first chapters about birds in general. In the detailed by-family part of the book the scientific names of all the bird species can sometimes get a bit overwhelming. This is a serious work though one that's highly accessible.The book is well illustrated with many good explanatory photos and diagrams in the general chapters. In the catalog of bird families there are one or two pictures per page showing example species, but the real value in the book is in the information presented in the text. This is neither a field guide nor an identification guide for individual species.If you were building a personal science library and wanted to have one volume on birds, then this would be the one to get, even though it's not a field guide and probably won't have pictures or information on every individual species you'll observe in your area. It will however tell you more than you could ever want to know about birds in general, and for any bird species it will tell you a huge amount about the behavior common to members of that bird family.Highest recommendation.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMX0YMG6R2CF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770853049#wasThisHelpful","RMX0YMG6R2CF0","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, from the picture shown for this item (and even most of the pictures on the actual box), you might think you're getting some sort of Siamese-twin-duo-blender-appliance that has a dual base and can blend two things at once. But that's not the case as this is just a regular single blender that looks like one half of the picture. This is honestly pretty misleading and they need to have something to illustrate that what they're showing you in the picture is two views of the one device and not a multi-headed monstrosity. [Update: At least online here they seem to have gotten rid of the confusing pictures so yay]What you do get is a nice heavy-duty blender with a base that connects differently to two types of container. On the top of the base there are two concentric rings that connect to the containers. The outer lower-speed ring which the regular pitcher connects to, and an inner higher speed (5x faster it looks like) disc that mates with the ""cup"" style containers. The unit recognizes which type of container is mounted and enables only those programs (speed and duration) that it considers appropriate.You get the big standard-blender-shaped pitcher, and a 24-ounce and a 32-ounce bullet-shaped ""cup"". Everything is heavy duty, BPA-free plastic and it all feels good in the hand. You get one set of blades for the two cups, but you get two nice big screw-in caps for them that turn them into something like a spill-proof coffee container that you can pour out of and close.The blades for the cups look exactly like what you expect to see at the bottom of a blender, and when using the cups the system operates most like what you would expect in comparison to a standard (cheap) blender. In fact in the cookbook that it comes with, the 24-ounce cup is used for the vast majority of the recipes. The only real down-side to the cups is that they're small compared to the pitcher and you have to take them off and unscrew the blades to add or remove anything since the other end is sealed. Their size is good for one-two servings of juice.The pitcher is big (72oz+ though they tell you not to exceed 64oz for liquids) and has a somewhat unusual blade assembly which consists of a thick shaft the full height of the pitcher. It sits loosely on a hexagonal shaft that connects to the motor through the base, and the top tip goes into a depression on the base of the lid. Along the lower 50-60% of the shaft are three pairs of food-processor-style blades. You must have the lid on the pitcher in order to operate it, and you can either use its pour spout or you can take the lid off, at which point you must remove the blade assembly before pouring.Everything (apart from the motor base of course) is dishwasher-safe (they recommend top shelf for the blades and lids).It comes with a very nice 128-page cookbook of recipes specifically for this model. It give the majority of its coverage to ""juicing"" style recipes using the 24-ounce cup container. It has a reasonable variety of other recipes (soups, breakfasts, strawberry daiquiri and five other mixed drinks, etc.). All of the soup recipes have you cooling the soup down to room temperature before blending (and possibly re-heating afterwards) so it seems the blender may not tolerate high temperatures, thought the manual does not mention that as far as I've seen. There seem to be a few typos in the cookbook (in one place it calls for an 18oz blender cup for example).There's also a booklet with three-day starter juicing diets (one for men, one for women).The parts all fit together well, and all the parts of the system feel very heavy-duty and robust, though the moving parts deliberately fit together rather loosely. This, along with the 5:1 dual-geared base, make the system a bit louder than a normal blender and definitely nobody will be sleeping while you're mixing drinks :)Overall it's an interesting appliance, but one that's a little bit unsure of what it wants to be. There's a little bit of Juicer and a little bit of Food Processor in there along with a lot of Blender. It tries to be a bit more clever with its pre-programmed ""Auto-IQ"" timed operation modes than it probably needs to be, and that sometimes feels a bit limiting. It's big for a blender, though about on-par for a high-power juicing blender.There's a one-year warranty (though you pay for shipping both ways if you need warranty service).So, 4-4.5 stars I think, rounding down to four. I will come back and update this review after we get some long-term experience as to how it holds up.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A07PD4XGLN33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGV49M0#wasThisHelpful","R3A07PD4XGLN33","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm going to call this 3.5 stars (rounding up to 4). It does pretty well what it claims to, and if the idea of a less relaxed more frenetic version of Pictionary appeals to you and your family/group then by all means give it a try.Requires three AA batteries (and a philips screwdriver) not included. Has a physical on/off switch for when you finally want it to shut up :)It only includes 72 cards, but they have 7 clues on each side so just over 1,000 available clues which seems like plenty. There's no separate kids set of clues as in the current incarnation of the regular version of the game.The timer gadget thingy works fine. It's similar to what a chess clock would be if chess were a FOX sitcom with a laugh-track.It's OMG loud though, even on ""low"" volume (there are two levels selectable while pressing either of the buttons after the pause button is pressed). After a few minutes I taped a 1"" square piece of thin cardboard over the speaker which made a world of difference.You get to select how much time each team gets for the complete game (5 minutes is the default) and the teams take turns drawing and solving clues (you really want 4+ people to play Pictionary). The first round and randomly thereafter are ""all play"" rounds where both teams play at once and the timers do not count down. This means a total game will last significantly more than the 5-10 minutes you'd expect from the default 5m per team setting.I think they missed out on opportunities with this. It would not have been hard to add a few more game modes, etc.The buttons are large and brightly lit, and the game announces via voice who is playing that round (also indicated by which button(s) light up), gives you a ten second warning at the end of the time for a round or the last ten seconds in the game. The first team to run out of time loses.The manual is skimpy so it doesn't hurt it you've played the regular game before.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8RNYJYF3A9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5E4ULC#wasThisHelpful","RV8RNYJYF3A9I","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These appear to be high-quality dog treats. Dick Van Patten is the sort of guy I'm sure would only lend his name to a high quality product.Our one year old lab loves them (but then he loves everything). In a sniff test between these and his favorite bulk Costco dog biscuits (which he will happily sell his freedom for when it's time for a nap in his crate) he seemed more interested in the duck jerky than the Costo biscuit.The idea of ""jerky"" though suggests something that will require some effort to finish chewing, but he is able to pretty much gulp them down in about half the time it takes to say ""Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Immunity Support Duck Jerky"" so they're no good for occupying his time. Probably a (very) small dog would have more fun with them.His regular food is supposedly complete and balanced, so I doubt that he is deficient in vitamins C and E and I really don't think it likely that a little more is going to do much for him. In fact in recent human studies people who regularly took supplemental C and E died EARLIER than people who didn't, so once again our assumption that some part of biology is simple and straightforward turns out to be suspect.I'm not sure where the idea that vitamin C supplements are good for dogs comes from. Humans need vitamin C in out diets because our bodies (unlike most mammals) lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C at some point in the past so we get scurvy if we don't get enough. Dogs however can synthesize their own vitamin C just fine, and if you look at the ingredients of your regular dog food you may find vitamin E there, but they probably aren't adding any vitamin C since your dog is his own little vitamin C factory.So, great quality, trusted brand, dog likes them, possibly questionable health benefits, but if you're looking for a treat you can feel good about giving to your dog then these are great.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CO831QLOFGWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTCW1TW#wasThisHelpful","R1CO831QLOFGWY","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cool toy for younger kids. It comes with batteries (3xAAA) installed (you'll need a philips screwdriver when/if you ever want to change them) and has (thank god) an OFF switch as well as two levels of volume.There are a total of seven interactable components, and there's a light that illuminates both the lamp on the front and the headlight on the tractor on the right side.Every interaction with one of the controls elicits a response, and the package claims ""50+ fun & learning responses"" that it will cycle through.The interactions include:Pushing the blue button on the top flips the cow on the front down to reveal an owl (you could hide a small item inside there).The switch on the front will turn the light on and say ""ON"" and will say ""OFF"" when you turn the light off.The door on the front triggers a response both when you open and when you close it.On the right side is a key that rotates 90 degrees to and plays an engine start sound.On the back is a rabbit slider that can be moved back and forth and plays a response each time it moves.On the left side is a spider slider and a large pony/kitty/duck button.So there's a lot of interaction here to keep the attention of a 6-36 month old (probably with the emphasis on the earlier part of that range), while driving the parents crazy listening to the sounds over and over :)The box makes a lot of claims about its educational value for things like ""learn the names of farm animals and the sounds they make"" but honestly in most cases two or three animals are shown together so if you don't already know that it's the dog that barks and the pig that oinks, you might get a little confused.It seems sell and safely constructed and should stand up to a lot of abuse (apart from immersing it in water say).Good stuff. 4.5 stars.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J339JS244JH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9DI8YG#wasThisHelpful","R1J339JS244JH3","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You're going to need a bigger boat... Oh, wait this IS a bigger boat! It's about 21 inches long and 17 inches tall once assembled. That makes it pretty big for a bathtub toy, but it will be great in the pool as well. Its broad beam means it's pretty stable in the water.The interior space of the model appears to be filled with Styrofoam, so it won't fill up with water and/or sink. It's well designed for real water play. You may not be able to actually fly a Playmobil aircraft, but this boat can be put to real use.Design and construction are first rate as you'd expect from Playmobil. Assembly is pretty easy with the visual manual. It's not quire as foolproof as a Lego manual, but still you'll have no trouble getting it together properly (takes about 10 minutes) and figuring out where the stickers go, etc.Comes with three pirate figures, two functional cannons, a treasure chest, and an assortment of pirate swords, gold doubloons, and a few other miscellaneous play pieces.

"This review is of the device connected to an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1.2.Packaging of the device and its construction are up to ""Apple"" levels of quality and design. They're trying to emulate Apple (""Designed by Marley in Michigan, Made in China"") and the packaging has the same kind of presentation and layering that you would expect from an iPhone or similar Apple device.The speaker itself is solid and heavy. The front consists of a metal grille with holes cut in it, and a double layer of speaker cloth  behind that. There are four ""high-output long-throw 2-inch woofers"" and a microphone (somewhere) for use as a hands-free speakerphone. There's a wood panel on the back with ""M A R L E Y"" laser engraved into it. At either end of that are rubber flaps that fold down to expose an 1/8"" stereo input jack and a micro USB input for charging. The USB input has a small red LED to indicate charging that goes out when it's fully charged (took aboutfour hours fresh out of the box). As far as I know the USB is power-only and the device does not show up on the USB bus when connected to a computer. It is labeled as 5.0V DC 2.0A, suggesting it might make use of high-power USB ports, but I haven't been able to confirm that yet.It comes with a 3' USB A to micro-USB cable for charging. That and the warranty info and manual are the only other things in the box. The manual is 84 pages long, though only four are in English, and two of those are safety and recycling info.The user interface consists of four buttons (power, bluetooth, volume up and volume down). The only of these that needs some discussion is the bluetooth button, as not all of its functionality is described in the skimpy documentation. You can press it for three seconds to enter pairing mode. No password is required and the device will only pair with a single device at a time. Each time it powers on it will spend three seconds trying to pair with the device it was most recently connected to. If it can't it will go into aux-in mode (the logo on the lower-right front illuminates red for AUX and blue for bluetooth).While playing audio, you can press the bluetooth button to pause or resume the playback. It turns out you can also use the bluetooth button to answer a phone call and to hangup a call. If you do this, then the call audio will be directed through the speaker and it will use its microphone providing full hands free capability. If you answer a call from the iPhone, then the call can be moved to the speaker (or back to the phone) using the ""audio source"" button in the iOS phone app.With the volume control on the speaker all the way up, it's proportionally equivalent to the iOS device volume, so it seems like keeping the speaker at full volume and using the phone to control the volume level works the best.So far the iPhone to Liberate bluetooth has been solid, reliably connects when powering on the speaker, has good range etc.One annoyance is that with the speaker connected, all the phone sounds go to it via bluetooth. This means key-clicks and things like the sound the phone makes when you press the top switch to put it to sleep come out of the speaker, and this is especially annoying if you have the volume turned up to the levels needed for reasonable listening. This is probably more a feature of iOS than this particular BT Speaker though. The speaker also has startup, shutdown, and pairing sounds that it makes, so it's not a subtle device :)Also I discovered that it seems to have an auto power-off feature if it doesn't see any activity from the phone for 15 minutes, even if it's plugged into USB power. This means if the phone rings you won't be able to answer it with or through the speaker without powering it on and waiting the approximately 5-6 seconds it takes to power up and connect to the phone. As far as I know, there's no way to adjust or disable the auto power-off.But, you ask, how does it sound? It's fine, and probably pretty good for it's size, but there's nothing about the sound that blows me away. Even up close there's no real feeling of stereo separation (I did verify that left audio comes out of the left and right audio comes out of the right correctly). The experience is basically that of ordinary inexpensive computer speakers placed side by side. Neither the low or high end is anything special, and while it gets pretty loud without distorting, it's really not much of a replacement for a larger boom-box setup. But then it will fit easily into a backpack and can turn a room into a party if you have nothing else available.I watched parts of a few movies with it, and had issues with the dialog volume being too low relative to the music and effects which had me fiddling with the volume a lot. While the experience was much better than using the ""speaker"" in the phone, it didn't sound  as good as headphones would.As a phone hands-free speakerphone again it works fine, with reasonable microphone pickup but again nothing spectacular.So you're not going to get an audiophile experience with something this small, but the design and construction are very nice, the operation has been smooth and reliable, and for a portable, wireless (or wired via AUX-in), rechargeable speaker it pretty much rocks and I would have no trouble recommending it as a model to consider if you're looking for a small portable BT speaker. It definitely feels like a piece of professional audio gear, all metal, cloth, wood, and some rubber, with no plastic externally visible unlike most of its competition.So somewhere between 3.5 and 4.5 stars I think. I'll come and update this review when my opinion firms up a bit more :)G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0ELHA89UK70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC27UF8#wasThisHelpful","RE0ELHA89UK70","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These seem like excellent screen protectors. They go on very easily, and the slightly matte surface seems smoother to the touch than the bare glass screen. The screen definitely reduces glare and reflections off the normally mirror-like iPhone 5 screen.They came in frustration free packaging which is to say a small plain brown cardboard box containing an instruction card with simple visual directions, the four screen protectors each in their own poly bag, and nothing else. No card is included for pushing bubbles out (the instruction card isn't rigid enough really, so have a credit card handy) and there's no polishing cloth included as is with many other protectors. These issues are pretty minor though.Actually each screen protector turned out to be two stuck together, so there were actually eight(!) in the package. I suspect their package stuffing machinery needs a little bit of tuning. So maybe order fast and you'll get lucky like I did :)The protectors come with a protective film on only the adhesive side. The matte top surface is exposed from the beginning (though it's protected in its poly bag). The glossy protectors usually have an extra peel off film on the front as well, but it doesn't seem to be needed here.Their installation technique is to peel off the protective film over the adhesive side of the film, then pinch it slightly and touch the bowed out center line of the protector with the center line of the phone at the camera and home button holes, and this worked very well for the two phones I tested it on. Bubbles were easily coaxed out the edges, and only small particles of contamination resulted in an average of two small bubbles on each phone. I'm not sure what the source of these tiny dust particles was, whether it was something on the protector or (probably more likely) something that landed there between cleaning and applying the protector. When the phone is on they're not very noticeable.They each have five cut-outs, for the home button, speaker, front camera, and one hole next to the camera (proximity sensor?) and next to the speaker (for whatever that thing is there on the iPhone 5S).Comparing two phones side by side, one with the protector and one without, I see pretty much the differences I would expect between a matte and high-gloss LCD display. The protectored phone has much less noticeable reflections and a slightly more diffuse look. I think I like the matte look and feel of this screen protector better than the plain phone, but then I've always preferred matte displays over the mirror polished reflective kind. There will probably be people who would criticize the matte look as ""softer"", so if you're a fan of shiny displays then maybe you won't like these as much. For me I really like it and will keep it on my phone.I have no trouble recommending these to anyone who would like less glare on their iPhone 5/5s, and I think they enhance the look and feel of the phone over the default unprotected screen.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNPQJUMFSJWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQT0Q54#wasThisHelpful","R1KNPQJUMFSJWF","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, so, it's a power strip. And an extension cord. This is sort of an odd combo, since the power strip can't be plugged into the extension cord (the extension cord CAN be plugged into the power strip). It's like I would be going to shop for a power strip and then like ""dang, I need a cheap extension cord too! This is PERFECT!"". Or not so much.Anyhow, the power strip seems sturdy, has a short 3' cord, and a red illuminated switch (with integrated circuit breaker) on the top of the strip (easier to see and access than having it on the end next to the cord). The switch is on a raised part of the case relative to where the outlets are and it's about an inch from the first outlet, so a little bit of protection from turning off the whole strip accidentally when plugging something in. The individual outlets did not require excessive force to plug into (some strips require a lot of force the first time you plug something in) and seem to hold firmly. The bottom includes warnings about indorrs and dry location use only, and a UL listing holographic foil label. It is rated for 15 amps, and 14 gauge heavy-duty cord. Works great, does not take up excessive space. The outlets are all aligned with the ground pin towards the end away from the cord/switch as shown in the picture.The extension cord is a two-wire, polarized, non-grounded cord with three two-prog polarized outlets on the end. It is a 16-gauge wire and 13-amp-rated. It doesn't feel nearly as nice as the power strip. Also, the child-safety covers that you can slide over the outlets that aren't in use really don't work. they don't stay in place and will fall open under only the force of gravity if you hold it sideways.So 4.5 stars for the power strip and 2.5 stars for the extension cord.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X618HGIUOJLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XNSBXY#wasThisHelpful","R1X618HGIUOJLI","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book may be to Data Science and Big Data what Freakonomics was to Economics.The author is one of the founders of the dating web site OKCupid and has spent a lot of time sifting through the vast amount of data collected by user interactions with their website and each other, and he uses this wealth of personal and private information to explore what it can tell us about human social behavior.The writing is excellent and it is a very fun read (I was hooked by the second page of the introduction, finished it in a couple sittings, and was never bored).There's lots of information in this book that will make you think, and a lot worth talking about more. I think it's at its best in the first part where the theme is ""things that bring us together"" and he talks about statistics relating to how people find each other on his dating site. In the second part of the book ""what pulls us apart"" he deals with issues like race and what his data shows about the prevalence of racism in American society, as well as the internet's capacity for rage. The last part of the book ""what makes us who we are"" continues with the relationships theme as he investigates a few more racial as well as gay and bi-sexual issues before covering a few miscellaneous topics like comparing the kind of uses of this data he makes and his vision of using it for good compared to things like marketing and government spying.People who consider themselves Data Scientists may be bothered by the fact that he does not go into much formal detail and actually few of his analyses require any fancy math or a PhD in anything.It's a book that I can strongly recommend to anyone, both as a fascinating look into human behavior as well as an introduction to the sort of things that web sites are doing with all that data they collect on you, and as inspiration for those who aspire to the new discipline of Data Science, both in terms of the sort of things you can accomplish as well as some of the moral and ethical issues involved.Probably the most interesting and thought-provoking book I've read in a long time.G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3215VPZ5YBF5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347375#wasThisHelpful","R3215VPZ5YBF5B","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really neat book if you're interested in becoming an architect or learning more about what architects do. It's most interesting feature is that around half the book consists of Q&A interviews with architects asking about why they got into it, how they decided where to go to school, what they do in their current job, etc.It does a relatively complete job of giving an overview of the stages of an architect's career from education through later professional development.It's written from the pro-architecture viewpoint, and as such is generally positive about the profession. You can see though the interviews that not everyone who enters architecture ends up doing original building design on a day to day basis (in fact very few do) and some end up as ""facilities managers"" and the like, positions that they might have been able to reach more simply than by taking the route through architecture school.If you're considering architecture, then I think this will be a very useful book. I found it interesting and informative and well written (which one can't say about too many architecture related works from my experience).G.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0YNDJAEVJ72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118612132#wasThisHelpful","R3E0YNDJAEVJ72","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our 1yo Lab seemed to enjoy these. ""Long lasting"" is a relative term with an 80lb dog whose major avocation in life is methodically reducing his world to bite-sized pieces. It takes him maybe 5m to consume one of these. It's pretty clean without too many crumbs etc. No strong scent.So far he seems to enjoy them (the Turkey flavor) and they have not had any obvious negative impact on him.They're pretty small (4 1/2"") and only three per package so you'll go through them pretty fast. They're a hard, vaguely rubbery texture and were obviously extruded without any other structure to them. Not terribly ""bone"" like IMHO.They're fine, but I'm not sure why I would chose these over anything else in the premium dog-treat category.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3AVMV0MY1XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WW862O#wasThisHelpful","R1M3AVMV0MY1XP","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Expensive of course, but if you're reading this it's probably because your organization is relatively large and you've bought into the whole Fluke Networks suite of stuff, and I'm not going to base this review on whether this product makes good economic sense or not.The software works fine as a basic connectivity and mapping tool, especially if you have other Fluke Networks software and tools to share floor plan layouts with etc. But it does not do anything more than super-basic packet capture and honestly you could get most of the same capabilities with free open-source tools or less-expensive (but less name-branded) commercial tools.The big reason for the lack of stars in this review however is the horrible licensing process which makes it feel close to impossible to use the software once you actually have it. Creating web accounts, messing with license files, associating the license with a network adapter, having to wait an extended period for license delivery, multiple contacts with technical support, numerous web searches, etc. before I was even able to run the software for the first time (something like four hours invested just to get the thing working). This left such a bad feeling that I would actively avoid any Fluke software-based solutions in the future, which is a shame as their hardware-based tools are always the best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSH2JX5CCDZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INMME42#wasThisHelpful","R2VSH2JX5CCDZV","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using it with a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro, and this is an excellent dock choice for this model, as the Yoga has USB 3, and seems to make good use of the dock's features under Win 8.1. Great for getting additional USB ports including USB3 when operating in a fixed location with additional outboard USB connected peripherals.The stand is surprisingly heavy and provides a good foundation. The Yoga 2 Pro is very stable in landscape orientations either notebook or tablet style, and can even be used in portrait tablet mode if you're not pushing on the top 1/3 of the screen (which might cause the computer to tip over the top of the stand, but the stand itself is still very stable and won't tip). you can also use the slot in the stand as simply a place to store the computer while charging and get a slight savings in desk-space.I have not yet tested and exercised the mufti-monitor features as much as I would have liked to before having to write this review however, so I have no strong opinion yet on its video capabilities.G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QAMISUEHF97F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAO9DPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QAMISUEHF97F","ARADXCOUVBS09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARADXCOUVBS09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They advertise it as being good for soccer, volleyball, etc., and yeah, you can kick it and hit it etc., but it's hardly a replacement for the proper balls for any of those things.It's molded foam that's reasonably rigid. The holes are nice and it feels satisfying to grip. It can be squashed flat with a few pounds of force.

"So this is a really interesting phone with a very modernist design. The handset is very thin, though the speaking end curves forward to point at your mouth which means it's not entirely flat. It looks good, but can be slightly awkward to carry around (you can't stand it on end so hard to place it where you can see the display).The base has a black surface with flush buttons whose presence is revealed by illumination that reveals which buttons are usable in a context-sensitive fashion. The phone comes with a sticker over that surface that demonstrates where the buttons are (since otherwise looking at an un-powered one in a store you wouldn't even know that there are buttons there) and I guarantee that 75% of owners will never see the glowing buttons because they're never going to peel this sticker off.Mine died after only a few days unfortunately (handset went dead).The reason to buy this phone is its design and ""look"", so if that appeals to you then you'll probably be very happy with it. Some people may find the flat handset to be more of an annoyance than anything else and be happier with a traditional cordless phone.There's a default female voice for the answering machine.

"This is a great little tool. It feels rugged and good in your hand (like all Fluke devices). Definitely not waterproof in any way though!Operation is simplicity itself. Plug in a cable and push the button and watch das blinkenlights.

"This is a very dense book with a lot of information.

"This review is for:Jawaytool®6pc Phillips and Flat Precision Screwdriver Set CRV Eyeglasses Watches Electronics Computer Tool KitForget the cheap tools you are used to seeing from China because this is a good set of precision screwdrivers.  They come in a very nice, locking plastic box.  The handles are aluminum with a rotating cap on the end to make holding and turning easy.  The handles are anodized in several bright colors.  There are three Phillips head drivers and three flathead drivers.  The metal that the driver tips are made from is strong and won't strip out when trying to screw something.The screwdrivers are easy to hold and use.  The shape of the handles makes them easy to use.

"This review is for:Pure Sun Naturals Turmeric Curcumin with BioPerine - 120 CapsuleI have fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  I have pain a good deal of the time but due to stomach ulcers, I cannot take ANY NSAID pain relievers for my pain.  So I have been forced to look elsewhere for relief of my pain and inflammation.  The pain is caused by the inflammation and Turmeric Curcumin has been proven to relieve inflammation as well as providing pain relief by doing so.This particular brand has a dosage of 350 mg of Organic Turmeric, 150 mg of Turmeric Extract and 5 mg of BioPerine.  My regular dose that helps me is around 750 mg of Turmeric per day, so two of these capsules provide me with what I need to combat the pain throughout the day.  I am not sure how the BioPerine helps, but this particular brand is better at relieving my inflammation than other brands I have tried.This is a very good supplement for people with pain from inflammation or people who want the antioxidant effect from the Turmeric.** I received this bottle of Turmeric Curcumin with BioPerine at a discount in order that I may try it and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZLSZRUSY6NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLKBLFO#wasThisHelpful","R3IZLSZRUSY6NB","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for:Beef Jerky for dogs - Wizzlers - 7PK Real beef dog treats made in USA - All Natural, 100% edible, great healthy dog training treats from Jack's Premium!These are great treats for dogs that love to chew.  They are especially good for puppies.  You can train the puppy to chew on this and not your shoes.  These treats are HARD not soft.  The dog has to gnaw at it and get it soft before they can get any meat from it.  Once they soften it up, it is just like a beef steak for them to chew on.These have no dyes so they are safe on your carpet.  Our Poodle ate his on light colored carpet yesterday and there were no stains on the carpet.Our dog really enjoyed gnawing at the treat.  He did not come anywhere near finishing it by the time he was tired and ready for bed.  So it lasts a long time. He chewed at it for 45 minutes before it was time for bed.  This morning, he is gnawing at it again.Once dogs learn how delicious these treats are, they will go nuts when you give them one.  These are good for big and small dogs.  If you dog likes meat and likes to chew, these treats are fantastic.  If you know your dog only likes soft treats, they probably won't like these treats because they are very hard to begin with.These are very good treats for dogs.  They allow them to chew on something that is okay for them to chew on and not your shoes.** I received these Wizzlers dog treats at a discount in order that I may try them and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1NBR0T6SX5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011898XCS#wasThisHelpful","RK1NBR0T6SX5U","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for:Snap-N-Store Letter-Size File Box, Black (SNS01533)This is a decent file box.  It snaps together and the snaps are very good, very tight.  It doesn't offer to fall apart, even when loaded with files.  The size is great for our uses.  We needed a file box to put into the closet fire safe for important documents.  This one does the trick.I read some reviews that said it fell apart, came un-snapped during use. I don't see that happening.  The snaps hold very tight.  After reading some reviews I was ready to put some glue on the snaps to make it permanent.  But that was not necessary.  If you snap the snaps properly, the box stays together even under load.  The people that had problems with the snaps holding obviously did not snap them completely shut, because the hold just fine without glue.The lid... it is about an inch too big in all directions.  But I just needed the box to hold files, the lid doesn't really matter to me.  This is an inexpensive solution to file storage that looks good to boot.  4 stars because I like it.  It is not perfect, but it is worth 4 stars and works well for my needs.From looking at the picture in the ad and then my pictures, you can see they changed the product.  Evidently they put better snaps on it and they hold tight now.  But they didn't change the lid, so it is way too big.  But, as I said, it works well for my needs of a file box in the fire safe.  I'm going to use it without the lid anyway.** I bought this file box at full price for personal needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZCVI18UTHJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019TRAFE#wasThisHelpful","ROZCVI18UTHJD","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for:FEINZER Professional Luxury Ceramic Knife Set (3 Piece Knife Set)This is a beautiful set of ceramic knives.  The handles and the blades are black.  Very cool looking set.  The handles are minimalistic, just enough handle to be comfortable in your hand.  These knives come very sharp.  They cut very well right out of the box.  We cut tomatoes, squash, broccoli, carrots and celery and everything cut so easily.  It is great to have sharp knives to use.These knives are as beautiful as they are sharp.  The quality of the edge is very good for cutting.  It has enough angle to remain sharp for a long time and is not too sharp with a brittle edge like a razor.  This set should last a long time, provided you take care of them.  Ceramic knives need special care.  Never put in the dishwasher.  Always wash with dish washing liquid and warm water.  Do not allow knives to contact each other in the drawer as damage to the edge might occur.

" 1:50 MinsThis review is for Koozam Orthopedic Anti-Slip Memory Foam Seat Cushion for Back Pain Coccyx Spinal Alignment Relief with Bonus Velour Cover (Large)Let me start by saying this Large seat cushion is a full inch larger all the way around than a standard seat cushion. (19"" wide by 15"" deep)  This makes it excellent for use in a wheelchair or recliner type chair just due to its size.  The cover it comes with is black velour and it also comes with an extra cover in burgundy.  I pulled the cushion out of the black cover and put on the burgundy cover with no problems.  You can wash the cover in the washing machine, but I would hesitate to dry in the dryer for fear it would shrink some. But you can probably dry it on low with no shrinkage.The bottom of the cushion has these little, rubber bumps that grip your chair so the cushion does not slide around in the chair.  This makes it good for invalids so it is not sliding out from under them in their chair.  But it is good for anyone who wants a little extra seat cushion.The memory foam in this cushion is very comfortable.  I've been using a cushion like this for over a year and this new one by Koozam is much more comfortable.  It really conforms to my body and makes sitting much more comfortable for me.  I'm so happy to have received this cushion as it has become my every day cushion in my office.  I was a little put off by its size, thinking it only would be good in a larger chair.  But it fits in my office chair just perfectly and provides the cushion I need for my back problems.I'm very pleased with this orthopedic seat cushion.  It is very comfortable and fits in my chair just fine.*I received this product at no cost in order that I might test it and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UJVWFEJMU2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZL475Y4#wasThisHelpful","R7UJVWFEJMU2U","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for:Depend Guards for Men, Maximum Absorbency...We bought these for my father, who is 83.  He has been having a bit of trouble with incontinence at night while sleeping.  These Depend Guards for Men are just what the doctor ordered.  Literally, the doctor said he should get these.  Because he's embarrassed about his problem, we had to get them for him and show him how to use them.These are a thick, absorbent product that fits men well.  The guards are shaped like underwear and have an adhesive strip that holds them in place in your underwear.  They stay put well and are absorbent enough to capture and hold almost any accident, day or night.  The package contains 52 guards for protection day and night.  They are not noticeable when worn in the underwear.  They work in boxer-briefs and briefs.

"This review is for the Hydrofeet Dynamic Liquid Massaging Orthotic Insoles.First of all, I'd like to say these insoles are very different than the insoles I have tried in the past.  They are filled with liquid, NOT GEL!  In the instructions that come with the insoles says: 'They feel weird! It's a good weird!""  They sure feel weird when I first tried them. It takes some time to get used to the squishy feeling.  To me, it's like walking on a shallow waterbed. It took me a while to start getting used to it.Secondly, the insoles are thinner than most of the gel insoles that I have.  These insoles says they provide you arch support, cushioning and shock absorption, and soothing massage by moving the liquid back and forth while you walk.  I have to say there is not much arch support due to the fact that the insoles themselves are very thin. But I do feel that the liquid is massaging my feet and provides some cushion to the bottom of my feet.I actually put these insoles between the gel insoles that I have already own and they work out much better than using them alone.  Overall, these insoles are bit thin but flexible.  They provide some cushion and massage to my feet.

When you open it, it is pearl white color, almost clear, gel like liquid.  It smells like bubble gums with coconut ice cream to me.  It's pleasant.  I got plenty of lather by using a wash cloth with the shampoo and rubbing him all over.  It's pretty easy to rinse the shampoo off.  The dog smelled wonderful after the bath.  I can't quite place the scent, but it smells terrific.I have only used this one time for my baby dog.  I noticed he haven't scratched as much after the bath.

I have never tried a wrist blood pressure monitor before so I was happy to test this one.  It is compact, comes with its own little zippered case and works quite well.When you put the batteries in and put it on your wrist and turn it on, it automatically starts inflating the cuff.  It only takes about 25 seconds to get a reading.  I compared the reading to two different arm cuff blood pressure monitors and the results were comparable.This unit is small, so you can take it with you anywhere.  It will fit in a purse or back pack very well.  In the case it is only 3.5""x3""x3"" in size.This wrist blood pressure monitor works well and the readings are accurate.

"This review is for:[Outstanding Outdoor Speaker] Ayfee Wireless Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker, Rugged IPX6 NFC Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with 7W Powerful Drive and Passive Radiator for Outdoors/Shower (Black)This speaker came yesterday and I have had a chance to test it rigorously.  The speaker is all black with a silicone rubber jacket around the sides and a textured, metal grill for the speakers.  On the top are the buttons to make it work, power, track seek forward and reverse, and a phone button to answer the phone and use the unit as a hands-free product.  It has a microphone on top.This product is built well and is very sturdy.  It passed the 36"" counter top drop onto ceramic tile floor with no damage whatsoever.  I splashed it with water in the shower and it was just fine with that.  I'm impressed with the quality of this speaker.  This is a heavy-duty speaker that is resistant to water.  I did not immerse it under water because I like it and didn't want to take that chance and ruin it.  But I used it in the shower this morning and it performed well.It was easy to pair this speaker with iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy S phone.  You just push the power button, hold it down until the unit tells you it has gone into Bluetooth mode and then select the speaker on your device to pair and connect.  It took all of 5 seconds to connect the devices to the speaker.I used it for a phone conversation and the other party could hear me well as long as I was within a few feet of the microphone.  I could hear the caller well with no feedback sounds.The sound of this speaker is amazing!  For a little speaker unit, it puts out a lot of bass.  The bass has punch and the speaker sounds great.  The mids and highs do not get washed out by the bass.  The speaker gets really loud.  But even at peak volume, there is no distortion, even when listening to music with heavy bass.  I listened to pop, heavy metal, hip hop, country, and talk radio and everything I threw at it sounded great through this speaker.The bass response and peak volume are excellent on this speaker.  I am really pleased with the sound reproduction.  This is a great sounding speaker that will work in almost any environment and works well.  It is easy to pair and connect.  It rounds out to a very excellent speaker I am happy to own.  This is my new shower speaker and just plain every day speaker.** I received a complimentary sample of this Bluetooth speaker in order that I might test it and leave this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S85O0FDIB7ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVAR0OA#wasThisHelpful","R2S85O0FDIB7ZS","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for #1 Bed Sheet Set on Amazon - Super Silky Soft - SALE - HIGHEST QUALITY 100% Brushed Microfiber 1800 Prestige Bedding CollectionsThese sheets are beautiful, luxurious, but thin.  I think it's great for summer.  They are not cotton sheets but 100% Brushed Microfiber.  Do not mistaken the name '1800 Prestige Collection' to '1800 thread count'.  They are not the same.  This is my first brushed microfiber sheet set and I did not want to worry about any possible color fading issue after laundry, so I pick a safe color, ivory.  My wife likes neutral colors anyway.  I ordered Ivory, and it just looks like the picture when I received them.I laundered the sheet set according to the instructions: machine wash cold cycle, tumble dry low heat, remove immediately. (This is important if you want to keep your sheets for a long time.)  After one laundering, the sheets came out nice and soft.  I didn't have any problem with shrinkage on the first wash. It fits my queen size mattress just fine.  They came out of the drier almost wrinkle free.*I received this product at a discount in order that I might test it and leave this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KK23B9WNCNLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1SO2Y6#wasThisHelpful","R1KK23B9WNCNLZ","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for PetAmazed Best Salmon Fish Oil for Dogs ☆ 100%...My dog was all over this salmon oil.  I put a squirt into his dish and he licked the dish for 5 minutes after the salmon oil was already gone.  He's pretty picky about what he eats.  He has to have a grain free diet due to allergies.  If we don't do grain free, he gets ear infections.  Go figure.This salmon oil is from Norwegian salmon.  It is processed quickly from off cuts of salmon fillets.  The nutritional contents are good, they have EPA, DHA, DPA, ALA an Omega-3 and Omega-6.  As well, they have a lot of each nutrient.  You can use a very small amount.  For my little dog, it only calls for 1 pump on his food.  For a dog over 75 pounds, it calls for 4-5 pumps.My dog likes it and it is full of good ingredients.  I'm very happy with this product.  It is very cost effective with such small doses being adequate.  This bottle will last us quite awhile.  At 5 ml per pump, this bottle of 500 ml will last us 100 days!  Of course the cost goes up the large your dog is.  But for me this is a most excellent value.** I received this salmon oil at a discount in order that I might test it and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4AZ4IOCN9IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1TIYS8#wasThisHelpful","R1P4AZ4IOCN9IU","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:56 MinsI have tested 30+ earbud headsets this year and this pair blows them all out of the water. They work by producing the sound with drivers in the cables. The sound then travels up the air tubes into the earbuds and into your ears.The sound on these is tremendous. First of all, there is actually bass, thumping bass punch. The mids and highs are clear and not muddied by all the bass. The sound is very balanced and they can be very loud if you enjoy listening to them loud. I could only turn the volume on my iPhone up to 60% before it hurt my ears. But I'm old. I used to listen to music loud when I was younger, so I understand that. These headphones get very loud is my point.It's a toss up which is better, the A3 or the A1.  I find them both very good quality build and sound is tremendous.  I would say it's a tie.  So if you like the way these look, get them.This pair has gray tubes with gunmetal earbuds and a black, braided cord at the split of the cables.  They are black silicone from the split to the earbuds.  They have a green, metallic ring around the earbud near the tip.  They have a microphone with a phone button that will answer the phone or pause the music when pressed.  The earbuds are smaller than other earbuds because the driver is in the cable, not in the earbud.  This means you can have a smaller earbud.These are the best earbud headset that I have tested this year, tied with the Aircom A3s. The sound is terrific and the design is great. They really are worth the price. If you want pounding bass and/or high volume, these are great. If you are on the fence on these remember that you can return them if you don't find them satisfactory. But I can't see anyone returning these because they sound so good.** I received a complimentary sample of this Airtube headset in order that I might test it and leave this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7UV6YKF2ZLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1F8HM8#wasThisHelpful","R3K7UV6YKF2ZLD","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for:Expower Extendable Selfie Handheld Stick with Built-in Bluetooth Remote ShutterThis selfie stick works.  I don't think it has Bluetooth, but when you plug the cable in and press the shutter button, it will take a picture.  I really like the cradle for the phone.  It stretches big enough for my Samsung Galaxy S4 in a silicone case.  So it gets pretty big.  It will stretch to 80 mm to fit a larger device.  I also like how the cradle holds the phone.  It holds it in the middle, not to the side like some.  Those always press the power button on my phone and shut the phone off when installed.  So I like how this one grips the phone in the middle.All you have to do to make it work is plug it in, provided your camera is set up to use it.  If pressing the button makes the camera do something else, like zoom in, you will need to change your camera settings in the Settings area of your device.  Once you set up the camera to trigger the shutter, you are ready to start snapping selfies.The pole is a standard, telescoping rod that extends easily to 33 inches.  The handle is black, the extending rod is chrome.  You can use the cradle on any standard tripod for group pictures or close ups where you need the phone to be steadied.  It has a metal nut embedded into the plastic of the cradle, so it won't strip out.This is a good selfie stick that will work well for anyone with a device that takes pictures, provided the device is 80 mm wide or less.** I received a complimentary sample of this selfie stick in order that I might test it and leave this review.

"This review is for:Acacia Wood Pizza Peel By Heritage. Used By Pizza Parlors, Home Chefs, and Artisan Bread Makers.The UPS man brought me a big box today, containing my pizza peel. It is beautiful wood. The picture does not do it justice. Funny thing, it was delivered at the very moment I was opening a frozen pizza box to bake a pizza. So, we got to try it out right away. It works great for putting the pizza into the hot oven. The pizza baked and it was time to remove the pizza. This peel worked like a charm to get the hot pizza out of the oven.It is made from solid wood.I think you can cut the pizza on the peel, but the wood is so nice, I didn't cut on it. We'd like to keep it nice. I cut the pizza on the cardboard circle that it came on in its package. But it is a very hard wood, so I think you could probably cut on it if you wanted to.We're really pleased with this pizza peel.

"This review is for:Innovo Forehead and Ear Thermometer (Dual Mode) - Newly released on Jan 2015 *CE and FDA approvedThis thermometer has dual modes.  That means you can use it to measure temporal temperature or eardrum temperature. This is handy to have the dual modes.  The thermometer comes with two AAA batteries, a small rest to place the thermometer on when not in use and instructions.To use it as a temporal thermometer, you leave the end cap on and press against the forehead while holding the F1 button and move it back and forth.  You'll hear a subtle clicking noise, this means it is working.  In just a few seconds the highest temperature will appear on the LCD screen.To use as an in-ear thermometer, take off the end cap and pull the ear back and up to straighten out the ear canal.  Then place the thermometer into the ear and press the F2 button.  It will take the temperature and give the result very quickly.I took my temperature using a standard, digital, under the tongue thermometer for a baseline temp.  I then took my temps via the Innovo Forehead and Ear Thermometer using both the in-ear and forehead modes.The temps between the under the tongue and forehead were within a few tenths of a degree.  The ear temp was a bit lower than normal, but within a degree.  I would consider the forehead mode to be the more accurate of the two temps as it nearly matched the under the tongue temperature.  But I read somewhere that ear temperature is always lower than oral temperature.This is a very nice, DUAL Mode, thermometer that works well right out of the box.

"This review is for:OPOLAR Notebook Laptop Cooler Cooling Fan...My workspace routinely gets above 95 F.  My office is out on a screened in porch so I can watch the wildlife during the day.  So my laptop gets really, really hot.  Parts of it get so hot to the touch I wonder if I could fry an egg on it.  The Florida heat is relentless.This laptop cooler fits on your laptop if you have a SIDE VENT.  If your vent is on the bottom, consider another product as this won't do anything for you.  The way it works is you adhere a metal slide that fits into a plastic piece to the bottom of you laptop. (You can make it work without sticking anything to your laptop if you so desire. So you can use on multiple computers.)When not in use, the metal slide can slide in, out of the way.  When in use, just pull the slide out and connect to the fan blower unit and use the two little arms to grip the top of the laptop.  It goes on easy whether you adhere the slide to the bottom of your laptop or if you use it without sticking anything to your computer.  There is a set of 3 silicone shrouds that you can use to funnel the hot air into the fan unit.  But mine works well without the silicone shroud.So, once you have it on the computer, either permanently or temporarily, you can plug it in and turn it on. It plugs in using a MicroUSB to USB cable, which is included.  It has an automatic mode that adjusts the fan speed according to the amount of hot air blowing out of the laptop.  It will dynamically switch speeds by how much hot air is blowing out of the computer.  You can override the dynamic mode and adjust the speed of the fan manually.  Either way, you get cooling.  I like to put it near the highest setting when the temps out here get into the 90s.So, how well does it work?  My laptop was getting so hot I could hardly stand to type on it.  The wrist rest and keyboard were over 100 F as measured with an infrared sensor.  Now, with the cooler installed,  even with the temps in the 90s, the laptop measures in the high 70s where it was once 100 F plus.  The wrist rest is cool to the touch.  This thing really cools my laptop.  I am really shocked and impressed with how well this device works.If you are noticing errors and experiencing the computer locking up on hot days, you might be overheating the computer.  Something like this side vent fan is just what the doctor ordered to keep a laptop cool.  I could not be more pleased with this product and the warranty is very good.  1 year free replacement for product defect and 30-day no hassle return & refund for incompatibility.You can't beat the cooling or the 1 year replacement warranty and if it doesn't fit, you can send it back within 30 days for a full refund.  So, you have nothing to lose and fantastic cooling to gain.This is a very decent laptop cooler that has made my laptop cool enough to use outside on hot days.** I received a complimentary sample of this laptop cooler in order that I might test it and leave this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQAQE8IH8FNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKU47Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2CQAQE8IH8FNT","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for: WooPet! Dog Feeding Mat Large for Elevated Dog Feeder FDA Silicone - 24""x16"" Dog Food Mat LargeIf you have pets, you have a messy area around where they eat.  It's inevitable.  Our dog doesn't stop drinking when he walks away from the water dish, leaving puddles of water to drip off of his chin.  These puddles can be quite slippery on the tile floor.  This large feeding mat is really a nice way to keep the mess in one location and not slip on any food or water on the tile.  My little dog has already been using his for his breakfast meal and now I've put a couple of bowls of water out for the day.These are for dogs and cats. The cute fish bones and dog bones make it good for dogs and cats.  Our cat was very messy when he ate.  He would pick out the stuff he didn't like and toss it to the side of the dish for us to clean up later.You can actually wash this mat in the dishwasher, or just wipe clean with a wet paper towel.  Or if it is really messy, you can take it outside and hose it off.  It is easy to clean is what I mean.We got the gray one.  It works in our kitchen quite well.

The material on the top is a very fine synthetic leather that feels just like real leather.  It is a very nice dark gray color that fits in with my desk accessories very well.  On the bottom is a skid-resistant fabric that keeps it from sliding around.  That works quite well.The pad is good for mousing, it is ultra smooth and the mouse just glides on it very well.  It is nice to write on, it provides a little cushion so your pen writes very neatly.  The pad is low profile, only 3 mm thick.  But that is thick enough to provide a little cushioning for your elbows.This (synthetic) leather desk pad feels incredibly good to the touch.  It provides a large surface for mousing, writing, and keeping your laptop from sliding around.

No.  I made a cup in my French press maker and let me tell you... it was delicious!  First of all you open the pack and it smells terrific.  The grind is good, not too fine, not too coarse.I poured the hot water into the French press, over the two scoops of Marley One Love coffee.  I stirred and let steep for 3 minutes.  Then I pressed it and poured the cup of coffee into my mug and added tasted.  Normally I use half and half but I wanted to taste the coffee before adding anything.I'm not a coffee snob.  I like coffee.  All kinds of coffee.  But it has been a long time since I had coffee worth writing about.  This coffee is very bold and full-bodied.  It is not bitter.  It is not too acidic.  I don't know all the right terms and words to describe it, just to say it is an excellent cup of coffee that I look forward to drinking all this week.If you like bold, full-bodied coffee with lots of lovely undertones, you may just love this coffee.

"This review is for:Sentey® In-ear Headphones Amplitude X90 (Black/Red) with In-line MIC Ls-4002 EarbudsI have tested a few Sentey products and I am always impressed by their quality.  These LS-4002 earbuds are no exception.These earbuds are black and red.  That's a popular color combination lately, I've noticed.  They have a triangular driver housing which looks pretty cool.  The cable is flat and does not transfer noise up into the earbuds when you move around.I tried a phone conversation using the earbuds and built-in mic.  I could hear the caller and they could hear me fine, save for some background noise.How do they sound with music?  Very, very good.  There is plenty of bass and the mids and highs are represented well.  There is plenty of punch to the sound.  They sound very balanced.  This is good for a moderately priced pair of earbuds.  I listened to rock, pop, hip hop, classical and talk.  Everything sounded very good through these earbuds.This is a good quality pair of in-ear headphones that sound really good.** I received these Sentey headphones at no cost in order that I might test them and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUZ15I9VO7FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODC9D7W#wasThisHelpful","R1UUZ15I9VO7FP","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for:ZenBar Protein Bar, Peanut Butter Chocolate...Want to get 19 grams of protein AND 80% of your fiber for the day?  This bar contains 20 grams of fiber. It contains the following ingredients:Whey protein isolate, chicory root fiber, prebiotic fiber, organic peanut butter, organic peanuts, organic sunflower seeds, dark chocolate chips, ground flaxseed, sea salt, stevia, organic vanilla extract.The bars are a standard size, 65 grams.  It's a good amount and filled me up when I ate one.  How do they taste?  Pretty good.  There are the peanut butter and chocolate chips in them.  They taste like peanut butter taffy.The only thing I did not like, and why 4 stars, was it is hard to know when you are done chewing and ready to swallow.  It never quite breaks down in your mouth.  But I did finally swallow each bite.  I felt full after eating it and did not get hungry again for several hours.  I got a lot of work done after eating it, it was energizing.This is a good protein bar if you like peanut butter and chocolate.** I received these ZenBars at a discount so I may test them and provide this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEAW5GMXTCQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYFWLNU#wasThisHelpful","R1DEAW5GMXTCQV","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for:Debot Micro USB Car Charger for Samsung and Apple: 3.1A Dual USB Port Electric...This charger looks like a spark plug. That should make it popular amongst the gearheads in the group. It looks neat and has 3.1A of power through two USB ports.The style is the best thing about this charger. That and that it has two ports so you can charge two devices instead of just one. It comes with a long USB to MicroUSB cable for charging Samsung and HTC devices.This is a decent little car USB charger that will charge two devices at once.

"This review is for:Weighter Kitchen Scale Serves - Professional Precision - Food in Gram Lbs...We all want simplicity.  We all want things that work well right out of the box with no extra steps to prepare the new item.  This is simply a kitchen scale and nothing more.  It works well.  I tested it with my scientific weight set and it is accurate.  You don't have to weigh right in the center to get a correct weight.The sellers state that this scale has no bells and whistles, it just works.  I would say that statement is true.I like that it is easy to use and has big numbers that are easy for me to see in my old age.  My eyes are not what they used to me and I appreciate the large digits.  I also like that this scale weighs the platform.  Other kitchen scales I have tested use the 4 feet as the weight sensors.  If you mess up one foot, the scale won't work anymore.  With this scale, the platform weighs and as I said, it weighs the same all over the platform.This is a very capable kitchen scale that is easy to clean and accurate on the weights.*I received a complimentary sample of this product in order that I might test it and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6MFK8VM2QJET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT728WG#wasThisHelpful","R6MFK8VM2QJET","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for:Scouty's Travel Double Pet Bowl w/Bonus Single Dish, Bottle Loop & Clip - Pop-up Expandable / Collapsible Silicone - For Dogs and Cats, Food and WaterThis is an idea whose time has come.  We all travel with our pets and I'm sure we all have an old bowl we keep in the car for watering the pooch on trips.  But it takes up more space than it needs to.  This Scouty's travel bowl set compresses down to about 1"" thick yet opens up to a full-sized water and food dish for travel.  It folds and unfolds easily.  It's easy to find a place to stuff it when not in use as it folds down so small.  It can even be slipped into a backpack for day trips with the dogs.The water bottle and bonus single bowl are excellent for trips to the dog park.  You can take water and a dish anywhere.  The design of the bowls is ingenious and I have some measuring cups that compress the same way.  It's really a space saving design.My dog, Freddy, drank his water and ate his food out of this dish last night and he loved it.  The shape helped him get the food into his mouth easier.  Although we will reserve this for travel, it was nice to see he didn't mind using it at all.  It is also easy to clean the bowls.This is a nicely designed pair of dog bowls with bonus water bowl that hooks to a bottle of water.  Very well-designed and works well.** I received this product at no charge so that I may test it and provide this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K236EAN6M85I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YS4OQVI#wasThisHelpful","R2K236EAN6M85I","A506HOOCVL8GW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A506HOOCVL8GW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for:Weighmax NJ100-BLACK Dream Series Digital Pocket Scale, 100 by 0.01 g, BlackI am a low grade coin collector and often times I need to weigh a coin to determine if it is real or counterfeit. I also barter with silver and this scale comes in really handy for weighing the silver to be traded for goods or services.The scale is black with that rubberized finish and feels good in your hand.  You can calibrate the scale with a 50 gram weight but I found it calibrated just fine right out of the box.  A one ounce coin weighs 1.003 ozt.  That's close enough for my use.It weighs in grams, ounces, ounces Troy and carats.  The clear lid comes off and can be used as a weighing tray for bulkier items.  The scale is small enough to fit into your pocket or backpack.  I plan to take mine to coins shows to weigh coins to ensure they are real.  It will also be handy the day that I get a handful of diamonds I need to weigh.  You know, when I win the lottery?This is a very nice, capable scale that weighs in several weights and is small enough to fit in your pocket.

"This Expandable Hose is perfect for my parents. They don't have extra space in the park where they live. This set comes with the hose holder, hose and sprayer. Everything you need to get started.

"Our kids are healthy eaters who also love to juice. For a Christmas gift we decided a newer juicer would be great to get them. Gourmia GSJ300 Wide Mouth Masticating was just what I was looking for.

There is less waste behind and more vitamins in your juice cup. The noise is not half as loud as their old one is. Not completely quiet of course but not bad. The pulp tank is easy to just take out and dump. The juice cup has a strainer in it so if any pulp you don't want gets in your juice it will strain it out.

"Sentey Gaming Headset is a gamers friend for sure! They are very padded so they are comfortable. They have to be to have them on for as long as some gamers do(over an hour!). The microphone is great. It is hidden in the earpiece and you just fold it down. The sound comes in nice and clear. There is no muffled background noise like other headphones I have tried. There is 2 settings, regular and vibration. Vibration really blew me away. I love that it vibrates with the sounds of the game. Listening to music is just as cool too!

"Elite TechGear Insulated Lunch Box Cooler Set is just what I wanted. The insulated bags keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. That is perfect for work or play! Sometimes I take a light lunch to work but like to have my own drinks. With this set, I can use the smaller bag for my lunch. The bigger bag can be used to put my bottles in. I really like that the antimicrobial properties resists mildew, mold and odor. There is nothing worse then lingering odor in your lunch bag, especially while I am at work! While this is waterproof it is good to remember that the thread on it is not so it is not 100% waterproof. Since they are compact they take little space while not in use.

"We live in an apartment. Storage is always an issue for us. I hate stuff lingering in corners! Jeronic 8 Inch Adjustable Bed Risers have helped us so much! Now we can have our bed risen up to an extra amount to put things under it. With getting 8 risers we have our choice of how tall or short we want to put our bed up.

"Pros:- Buying the bulk 40 pound package will save you money, significantly cheaper than the smaller packages per pound.neutral:- Their special water coating amounts to about 50% of the weight. Basically, if you buy the same 40 pound bag from another manufacturer without the coating, you'd be getting about twice as much seed.Cons:- growing was very subpar. maybe 10-15% germination. Despite watering as directed.Some people have had good results, but based on the reviews a lot of others have had similar poor experiences. Basically, good luck. I hear Scotts has good support, and refund policy.

I.e easy to run off or spill.Overall, it's hard to tell if this product works well or not for teething.

"This stainless steel diaper pail might be the one you want.Pros:- Uses standard bags. This the reason I opted for 4 stars instead of 3. We've had multiple of these, and all required proprietary and very expensive bag refills. This one uses any standard trash bag.- Stainless steel throughout.- lid seals to keep odors in- Attaching a new bag is a simple process.Cons:- The video shows the diapers falling all the way down after you press the buttons and close the lid. Sadly to report this is not the case. The diapers stay near the top, you have to push them down with your hand or another object. I guess if you have a tremendously heavy diaper it might fall all the way down, but normal diapers aren't going down.- At almost $90 its more expensive than just about every other diaper pail.Neutral:- Just an obvious warning, the diaper pail is Gray. The picture makes it look a little like stainless steel outside (add in the stainless steel diaper naming) and it's a little confusing. It's not silver, its plain gray, does not look like stainless steel in any way. The picture is kind of accurate, its just easy to think you are getting a stainless steel looking pail given the name and the picture. But its plastic gray.Overall, given the use of any trash bags, this is a good diaper pail. Buying refills won't break the bank, just use the same ones you already have. Initial purchase price is more expensive than it should be, but overall I am happy with this.7/10","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20J5AC2MIXJ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0UJ5SS#wasThisHelpful","R20J5AC2MIXJ0F","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars on this chocolate. The pros and cons should explain this.Pros:- Very creamy (almost melts in your mouth)- hazelnuts are sprinkled generously throughout- good taste and textureNeutral- At around $4 a bar, it's not expensive for quality chocolate.- Made by NestleCons- The first ingredient is sweetened condensed milk. While I don't have anything against this (and I absolutely LOVED it as a kid) this makes this chocolate incredibly sweet. Way too sweet in my opinion. The good thing about the sweetness is that I couldn't eat more than 1 small half and inch piece.- The second big problem of it being mostly condensed milk, is that the chocolate kind of loses the chocolate taste. It tastes more like caramel. Again not a bad thing, but not what I expected of a chocolate bar, and contributed to the overly sweet nature of this bar.Honestly, if you are looking for a creamy caramel + chocolate bar, with hazelnuts, and love very sweet chocolate, you will likely love this bar. For me, it was too much sugar, too much caramel flavor and not enough chocolate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YZ65G4HMN7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGNNI#wasThisHelpful","R12YZ65G4HMN7U","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a bilingual parent, trying hard for my daughters to speak Spanish as well - while being born in the USA, it's good to see toys like these, with both languages. Now, this is not a language learning tool, but the phrases at least are clear and not robotic sounding like other toys.Pros:- soft and cute looking- not very expensive- english and spanish songs and phrasesNeutral:- Since Shakira is partnering with Fisher-Price on these, I was partially hoping we had her voice in the toy. It does not.Cons:- The songs are only quick glimpses of a toy. 15-30 seconds. So not full songs at all.- Despite being bilingual is mostly an English language toy. It's not split 50-50 it's more like 80% English, 20% Spanish.- Can't wash it very well because of the electronics. and 1-3 year olds are messy creatures.Given the low price, this is probably a 7/10 product.

"This product is hard to beat as an ABC puzzle.Pros:- Bright colors / paintings- Puzzle (most all children love puzzles)- Wood pieces (will last A LOT longer than the cheap cardboard pieces)- Flip over wood base and you got a pretend little stove. (My almost 4 year old, LOVES this)Neutral:- If there is anything slightly iffy, is that it's a very non-traditional puzzle, so there are no clean shapes that fit into each other. They kind of go side be side together, but they don't ""snap"" or anything like that. I like the fact that it is non-standard, but just wanted to point this out.- Little expensive for a puzzle, but given the quality and the stove and materials, you are getting value for your money.Overall, you can't go wrong with this puzzle.

"This product is ok, but it's just hard to recommend at it's current price and the flavor/smell can go from ok, to not good at all.Pros:- organic- Relatively healthy ingredientsNeutral:- not all pouches mix as well, sometimes it takes a little work to get a decent mix.- Depending on flavor, some pouches can have unpleasant smells. I put this as neutral since a lot of baby food (especially those using broccoli and other strong veggies) smell pretty bad themselves.- For those who are trying to avoid corn (which is now in virtually all food) these have corn starch.Cons:- At $2 per pouch, even when buying in bulk its expensive. I buy other organic fruit pouches from Costco at less than $1 per pouch. Granted, it's fruit with a little big of vegetables, but thats less than half the price. And those are ready to eat, no need to mix anything.Overall, if the price was closer to $1.50 a pouch, might be easier to justify, but as it stands I can't recommend it without warning. You are paying a premium price, and the product is ok, but not perfect. If it mixed super easily, if the combinations were healthy but also tasted and smelled good, then maybe you could start justifying the high price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FE7996N32XXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3L4AS2#wasThisHelpful","R2FE7996N32XXO","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm torn about this product.Pros:- Mirror is large- You can adjust the position with some success to look at the child.- Mirror is so large, it might even keep your baby distracted/amazed looking at herself in the mirror.Cons:- Very cheaply made. Like most people, I'm familiar with plastic ""stuff"". Most toys and gadgets are made of plastic. So at some point, you can tell which is a good quality plastic and what is a very cheap plastic. This mirror is made of very cheap plastic.- The straps also look very cheap/weak as does the locking mechanism. I don't think these will last long.- I read a lot about mirrors and found out that recommendations from safety regulations say it's better to skip the mirror. Their are two main reasons.1. In the event of an accident, the mirror can become  projectile and hit your child or other passengers, making it dangerous.2. You need to be focused on the road, and this way to see the child can distract a driver and cause accidents.Basically, now I'm torn if I'm going to use it or not based on what I've read. Just wanted to point it out here, because it doesn't seem like it's very common knowledge about the risks (especially #1).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGUW6710HW07U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLFQLMO#wasThisHelpful","RGUW6710HW07U","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- materials well suited for kids. (nothing toxic, which believe it or not, is still common in a lot of yoga mats)- monkey pattern is cute, and should last a while.- Definitely does not slip. I have very slick floors in the house, and this sticks to the floor like glue almost.Cons:- The ""handle"". It's sad because it's supposed to be a feature, but I feel like they over thought this too much. Sure, its easier to carry if you want to move it around fully opened, but that's like almost never. if you roll it up, like most people, the handle is pointless. This wouldn't really be something against it, except that now my daughter wants to tug at it from the handle all the time. The handle does not have any reinforced stitching or anything, and I am afraid this will be the first part of the mat to break- It's super skinny. .15 inches to be exact. its almost like sitting on the floor. Children don't mind sitting on the floor much, but feels like they went extreme on the thinness.Overall though - if you don't mind the thinness this is a decent quality mat, as a decent price.It has a fun pattern for the child, without being too distracting. So I recommend this mat.However, I debated giving it 3 stars, because there are other kid mats in the $15-$20 dollar range, and these are on the higher $30+ dollar range of mats. I was going to take it down a star due to thinness, but upon some research I saw that most kid yoga mats are super thin, some even thinner than this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329VM68319Q68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRW8WAM#wasThisHelpful","R329VM68319Q68","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product could've been better and I might have rated it 4-5 stars if it weren't for the two issues it has.Cons:- The biggest issue by far is no temperature reading on the thermometer. You know how bluetooth connections can sometimes be finicky, and this thermometer is 100% useless without the app and bluetooth pairing. A small readout on the thermometer would've made a big difference. Sometimes you just want a quick temperature reading and don't want to depend on the bluetooth pairing and finding the phone.- The cap that it comes with to store it, falls off easily. There is no way to secure it, it's so loose, if you tip it at a small angle down it'll slide off and fall. You don't even have to nudge it over. This makes this protective cap almost useless.- Taking a child's temperature when they are moving is hard and gives errors. (especially tying to get an oral reading). Looks like if they move a little the reading needs to be started over.Pros:- You can have different readouts over time. Say you are checking on the fever progression of your little one. You take 8 temperature readings over 3 days, and you can get an idea if it's going up or down. The app logs and stores them under your child's profile. You can have multiple profiles for each child, yourself, etc.- It works on all 3 common areas (oral, rectal, under arm)- tip is flexible, so there is very little worry if this breaking.Neutral/Gimmicks- There is an area for symptom tracking, where you check of symptoms. The helpfulness of this is questionable.- The screen turns red/yellow/green depending on the temperature reading... I guess if you do not know what temperature means a fever, and you own a smartphone that cannot search google for the information, this might be helpful... not.- Upload a photo of your child along with the name! In case you forget your child's name, you now have a picture of them. If your forget their name and how they look like, this app won't help though.Overall, I feel like they got a lot of things right with this product. But as it stands, it seems like a first generation product, and their next version might correct these issues and make it a 4-5 star product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFB4VOK1TOV8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410Z22U#wasThisHelpful","RFB4VOK1TOV8X","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Pictures made it seem like each side would have its own color, but all the lights are yellow.- touching single instruments plays the same 10-15 second tune. This can get annoying. While touching the orchestra you can cycle through 8 songs, and add and remove instruments to each different song, if you tap the piano or just the violin to start, it's the same tune, over and over and over.Overall the ability to add and remove instruments, or touch an instrument to hear that sound separate from the rest should provide a fun present.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6WLWJORQLHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ0WAJG#wasThisHelpful","R2E6WLWJORQLHB","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've worked with computers and smartphones for a while. But I've always thought wearables (specially smart watches) don't seem to make much sense. But these fitness bands might have a place. This review will get long, as I'll be very thorough, and update it at various intervals.The rating reflects my first 24 hours with the band, but every few weeks or months I'll add to the review depending on how it goes. This review is based on the band paired with an iphone 6.PROS:+ Super easy pairing. I read some reviews saying it requires a computer in addition to a smartphone to pair. This is not true with this band. Basically charge the band and download the UP app on the phone. Then open the app and itll guide you. It paired in less than 15 seconds, completely flawlessly.+ Band updates, not just on the app. The second thing it did automatically was download some updates. Apparently you use to have to tap the band to change between sleep, high impact and other activities. Not anymore. The band does it all automatically. I have a newborn right now, and it did a surprisingly accurate take on my copious amounts of sleep and perfectly sound, 8 full hours of deep sleep. (Reported 5 hours and 2 wake ups between 2-7am which seems accurate as far as i remember)+ The band is comfortable light and secure. Clearly the listened to the issues people,had with previous band and did something about it. I cant see a normal scenario where this would fall off my hand. Its secure.+ People said they prefer other apps to sync to report food etc, but honestly i like the included food area here. It tracks a ton of different food and keeps calorie counts, etc. pretty impressive and i didnt expect it. Very easy to use. That said, the app is still very much based on food pyramid that pushes milk products as healthy even though if you do any research (Harvard recently removed dairy from their healthy food pyramid) you'll see dairy isn't the best thing for you. And yes, i eat and love pizza and Greek yogurt and ice cream and..+ looks good. I've seen some bands that look kind of odd. This one blends in and looks good.+ i really like the app with all the charts and the ""smart coach"", tells you what you are up to, steps ofmthe day percentages, compares calories eaten vs calories burned and more.+ silent alerts are a nest way to let you know something is up without an annoying ring.+ claims of a 10 day battery life, which is great. And takes they say about 90 minutes to charge to full.Neutral:- if battery dies, whole product needs to be replaced.- comes with a USB dongle but no wall charger, so you have to charge on a computer or borrow a wall to USB charger.- no instructions in the box. Just 1 page that says charge band abd download app. Just an FYI, it was just surprising. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out the band mechanism to adjust it to my wrist. Its easy, but having 1 drawing on how it goes on the printed paper would have been nice. The videos and information on the App, reference the old clasp, so they were useless.- id like the option of not synching so often to use less phone battery. Would be nice if you could choose to only sync every other hour ormwhatever custom amount you choose. As it stands it does it very frequently.CONS:- honestly have nothing bad to say about this product yet. Ill update the review as i gather more data.UPDATE #1- while it seems to have a good idea of when I fall asleep, and when I wake up for good in the morning, the middle of the night wake ups weren't showing up at all the past 2 nights. One particularly awful night of sleep when both my daughters woke up multiple times, and I was up at least 5 times was reported as my ""best sleep"" and had a shiny flowing light because I met my objective of 7 hours of sleep. So, I'll keep my eye out on this, at least start and end time seems accurate, but in between seems iffy at this point.UPDATE #2- After about a week, it's very clear to me that the sleep tracker is indeed mediocre at best. Everything from if I stay in bed an hour or so after waking up, it still counts as sleeping. Taking 1 star off the review due to this. Basically, sleep tracking just doesn't work very well, which is a bummer as it was one of the things I wanted to see.- Battery life seems accurate. Not sure how long it'll stay this long, but it works well. And it charges within 2 hours. So while you cook and eat dinner you can charge it, then be back tracking after that.- Bluetooth connection has been steady. I have had absolutely no issues on pairing. It has never had any issues syncing or anything else.- Still love the app, but I have started to notice some weird things in their food rankings. And foods that are easily found on other tracking apps (like my fitness pal) aren't found in UP. You can manually enter them, but it's weird. Steam broccoli, with lettuce/avocacado/tomato salad, with grilled tempeh and a cup of quinoa gives you a core of 8.2 in the health index. But a peanut butter and chocolate protein bar, gets a 9.5 as a super healthy choice. However, looking up those same foods in any online source, rate the energy bar as a D+ food, while the other as an A foo choice.- I shower with the band all the time, have played basketball, soccer, and other activities with it, not once have I ever had any issue with band coming loose or falling. It's a tiny bit harder to take off than a watch, but its very secure and won't fall off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Q8ZWVAVA5DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIG8S#wasThisHelpful","R14Q8ZWVAVA5DG","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of my daughter has this set and my daughter always goes to play with it (almost 4 years old now). However I feel like they went super cheap and it's not that great, however younger kids will likely still love it.Pros;- Has Anna, Olaf and Sven included.- sled as an extra dimension of play to the set.Cons:- while you can tell who the characters are, they are fairly poor replicates. Neither of the 3 look very close to the original animations. Not Anna, not Sven, not even Olaf. If they had spent a little more time getting a quality replica, I'd rate this set at least 4 stars. Anna looks very plain, more like a random girl instead of the princess that she is, and they made her hair bright blonde instead of the red/brown she has. Olaf looks silly, and not in a cute way.The other big fail, is that it's just a capitalize on Frozen fever play dough set. They didn't spend time to make a product that makes more sense. Like say, create icecubes and have kristoff transport them, or make play dough flowers or something more congruent. The set as it stands is kind of like here are among the most favorite characters from frozen and here are some play dough jars we needed to sell. Which is fine, but could've been better for sure.Overall though, our daughter loves it, and most children will love it too. But if they are very particular that something doesn't looks like how they expectIt, probably stay away from this set","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVB0Y04ACU7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPMDIBW#wasThisHelpful","R2NVB0Y04ACU7X","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish more thermostats would specify if they work with a wireless setup. A lot (most do not) but some battery operated - like this one - do work with a wireless setup. This does not work with a wireless setup. (Different from wifi in case you are confused when I first found this out a few years ago).pros:- app is pretty easy to use- can be installed horizontally or vertically. I like the horizontal one myself but I can see vertical being useful if installing in a narrow wall or between switches in a wall.- it's a clean modern design. Not as elegant as the nest, but I like the ability to program this one, as opposed to the Nest thinking it can do better than you automatically.Cons:None very obvious yet. I hadn't heard of this company before so I hope the product works well in the long run.Note:If you see this review beyond 2016, post a comment and it will prompt me to update based on the longetivity  and performance so far.Initial impression is good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFKC3PZQPMPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PTKWW6#wasThisHelpful","R2NFKC3PZQPMPB","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Lots of crinkling parts (the ears, the legs, the tailall make a crinkling noise when touched)- Different textures. The hooves, the horns, the hind legs, the rail, the forehead the nose, the ears, all have slightly different textures.- Very soft. I disagree with reviewers who says this doesn't work as a blanket, it totally does, it's that soft. Not a carry with you everywhere you go blanket (too big for that) but around the house on a particular cold day, you can totally put this over the baby with supervision.- Quality is very good. There were no loose threads anywhere or unfinished patches. Everything was perfectly sewn together.Cons:- Pricey. At almost $50, it's no cheap.- Situational. You can't really carry it around, so it's mostly a use at home item.- Because of the crinkling parts, and different textures and gentle colors, its not the easiest product to wash if/when your baby has a diaper accident on top. Or throw up, or all the other fun things babies do :)Overall, if you are expecting a little play mat that looks exceedingly cute, is well made, and you can drop your baby for tummy time or play time on it, this is a good choice. If you want a matt you can ""travel"" more with, this might not be the best choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAWK2PJ254SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V408WVE#wasThisHelpful","R1OAWK2PJ254SI","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lets break it down in simple pros and cons:Pros:- Nursing mom thinks it's helping. Hard to tell with these things.- Dissolves relatively easilyNeutral- Citrus flavor, while it contains sugar, it's very little. I tried it and thought it was good. Just a little citrus with virtually no sugar. But my wife who is the one drinking it, hates it. She mixes it with orange juice and says she doesn't taste it at all then. So if you hate the flavor, I suggest just adding the powder to your favorite citrus juice and you'll be fine.Cons:- It's not an obvious: ""this is really helping with milk production"" so it's hard for us to recommend it and say it is clearly working.Overall, it's a good way for those who enjoy a drink more than the more common hot tea bags of fenugreek or the pills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENNGR2NU28JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O96X4QI#wasThisHelpful","RENNGR2NU28JT","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very strange ""new product"" and I've trying to figure out what it is. Check out the less expensive Aerogarden 3SL which as far as I can tell is identical to this one, but around $20 dollars less. (You can find it for $49.99 dollar regularly).I own 2 Aergardens Ultra  (the LED variety, which light lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement and grow 7 plants each).When it was first offered to me, I checked and it read that this was an LED. So I thought the Aerogarden Sprout, was just an LED version of the Aerogarden 3SL, sadly to say, it is not. This is a CFL bulb with mercury, that you need to dispose ever 6 months, and buy another one for around $15. Amazon appears to have fixed their product description and LED is now not mentioned anywhere.But again, this product looks identical on every way to the 3SL, which is cheaper. So it begs the question as what exactly is this?The box or instruction manual it came with does not even list the Aerogarden Sprout anywhere. There is no branding anywhere that tells you which Aerogarden this is. So my suspicion is that they had an overstock of the 3SL and are trying to rebrand them as Aergarden Sprout, which sounds like a better name that came from the marketing department to try to fix slow sales of the 3SL.Ok, that rant out of the way, lets start with the pros and cons:Pros:- Occupies very little space. Can fit between the kitchen counter and cabinets, even when fully extended.- Very easy cleanup. (Cleaning up the Aerogarden ultra after a big season is like a half an our job. This one is like 2 minutes.)- Grows herbs fine.- Simple operation, just 2 buttons to set the light and the nutrients, thats it.Cons:- Replace propietary CFL bulbs every 6 months. These contain mercury and need to be disposed properly. It's not that simple and it's time consuming depending on where you live to do this properly.- It doesn't extend very much, so not only do you only grow 3 items, but they won't grow very big. Basil can take up the full extension of the Aerogarden ultra which reaches about twice as much as this one and product a ton of basil. This one will produce much less, even if I plant only 3 basil plants on the ultra and 3 on this Sprout, the Ultra would produce about 3 times as much basil.Overall, I am not a big fan of corporations claiming they are releasing a new product, even though they are just rebranding a poor seller. If this product was an LED, I'd feel better and give it a better rating, but as it stands, it's wasteful and to top it off, it's more expensive than the 3SL which is its twin.So, if you have very little space and need a small aerogarden, and you live in a town which makes it easy to dispose lightbulbs with mercury, this might be a good fit, otherwise, I'd get any of their LED products.I've changed the review from 2 stars to 1 star based on the following additional issues:- it's loud. I thought I'd get used to it, but it sounds like if you're must've boiling water in the kitchen and it's on an unstable pot that vibrates. By comparison, the much larger Ultra sounds like more like a pleasant water fountain and it is not nearly as loud or have all the vibrations this one does. Main problem is just that it's all plastic, there is no rubber to reduce vibration, and pump is at the edge, while the ultra pump is deep in the center under a lot of water so it's significantly quieter.- the other disappointing issue is that there is half a finger of space between plants (after the domes/seeds are in) basically not much space at all. I'd be shocked if this produces more than 1/5 (20%) of what the ultra produces. The ultra has 6 times as much space in between. (I can fit 3 full fingers in any direction, while not even 1 fits in the sprout)- Another issue for all CFL lights, is that they burn what they touch. So if you don't watch your plants closely, the taller ones will get burnt. LED versions do not get hot, and you can forget for a few days, then trim and you get perfectly fine produce, even the one directly touching the LED for over 24 hours.Updated back to 2 stars, because their customer service is excellent and that adds value to any product. I actually talked to an account manager, and I wanted to point out what they said:- This product is identical to the 3SL but with an improved pump. apparently the 3sl had bad reviews mainly due to the pump which made for little growth and high failures. They changed manufacturer of the pumps and now all the issues of the 3SL should be improved.- contrary to some people who still insist (view comments section) this product is NOT an LED. Manager confirmed this as well.- 3sl is getting phased out due to the pump issue, so soon you'll no longer be able to buy it. The sprout is the replacement product fixing old issues.UPDATE on growth:* With my other Aerogardens, each pod usually produces around 3-4 starts, which typically end up as 2-3 strong growing plants (when doing basil, which is what I started here.* It's only one sample, but I got just 1 start on 2 of the pods, and 2 starts on the other. So 4 total plants growing out of 3 pods. This is virtually the equivalent of just 1 of the pods on the Ultra LED.Aerogarden introduced 9 new Gardens, all very decent products in their fall 2015 revamp. This Sprout is the only one they retained with CFL bulbs. All the rest are LEDs and much better. Spend the extra money on the Sprout Plus (this one but with LED bulbs) you'll get better growth and save money in the long term. (yes, better product that in 1.5 years is already cheaper than this one, based on power consumption and cost of replacement bulbs). Plus you don't need to deal with mercury every 6 months trying to find a facility that can properly dispose of these.Honestly, they just wanted as cheap as possible entry level product, and a way to keep selling their huge stockpile of CFL bulbs. The LED gardens are the way to go. No toxic elements, and no replacing every 6 months. Disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MY2DC0X2RH9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJMWW#wasThisHelpful","R2MY2DC0X2RH9G","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here will be a journal of the 8 weeks of use of this thing, starting from day one. I'll use this every day and post updates periodically during this time.About me:4 years ago before having children I was in great shape and had a visible 6 pack, now I'm 20 pounds heavier, and the 6 pack is gone.Expectations:Since I know that the weight gain is the main culprit, and my abs won't come back unless I also lose at least 15 pounds, I don't expect to have a 6 pack back after this 8 weeks. This device is not to lose weight, it's just a convenient way for me to ""exercise"" my abs while I cook, clean, feed my daughter, or other miscellaneous household chores. So I am hoping my abs feel like they are getting a workout and my core feels stronger in 8 weeks. I am not coming in with the 100% unrealistic expectation of a toned stomach after 8 weeks, this is no miracle, it's just electrical stimulus for the abs, not a melting machine for the extra layer of me in between it and my abs.Basic hardware review.Pros:- Belt seems durable, comfortable- Easy setup.- Batteries were included, and it uses standard AAA batteries (3 of them), so you can use/buy your own easily.Cons:- The control unit is thick and old school. They suggest you can wear this under your suite for work. Sure, it will fit under your clothes, and the belt itself would not be noticeable, but the control unit is unnecessarily thick and looks like very cheap plastic construction. There is no hiding the control unit under any type of clothes. Maybe under 3 coats in the middle of winter while shoveling snow you can wear this outside. Otherwise it's an indoor only use. Again, if they had spent some money making a better and slimmer control panel you could get away with wearing this under a suite or a coat, but it's over half an inch thick. Anyhow, big bulge, saying you can use it under you coat is misleading. Sure you can, but you'll look real funny.- The pads need to be replaced periodically, and there are no spares included.Week by week review:Day 1:- Initial setup was easy, about 5 minutes being careful with the pads and making sure I read the instructions.- I started increasing the intensity (goes from 0 - 130) and it curiously does it independently by side. So you can have 1 side at 20 and the other at 40. (It has 3 contact points, the center cannot be controlled, only the 2 sides.- From 0 to about 14 I felt absolutely nothing, then each tick after that felt like I was just getting shocked. I double checked all the contact points and everything was in order, all contact points completely covered, the position of the belt, etc. Tried it again, and same thing. Since I've never had electrical stimulus, I am just going to assume it feel like yes, you are getting shocked.- I did the initial quick setup recommended time of 20 minutes. I set the left side at 22 and the right side at 20. That was as much ""shock"" as I was willing to tolerate for the first go around. Despite the increase on the left side, I still felt I was getting shocked more on the right side.- Since I hadn't really exercised my abs (I play soccer and basketball once a week each, but not real other exercise) I was expecting my abs to be sore the next day. They are always sore if I do a lot of abs after not doing them for a while. To my disappointment, my abs felt like I had done nothing at all the day before. I'll see today if I can tolerate higher shocks, but as of now the jury is out, and not looking good.- The 20 minutes I wore this, I was playing with my daughter, mildly active, running around. and did some crunches at the same time (only a dozen or so) just to experience the dual action.Ill update this weekly or so during the next 8 weeks. I've never tried one of these ""As seen on tv"" products, my expectations are pretty low, but since I am getting a chance to review it, I figure I'd give it a chance.End of Week 1:- The unit still feels like it's electrocuting me a little. My abs have not felt sore at all.- I'm using it for 25 minutes. You can control each side individually.  but they stop you at a 10 intensity level difference. So basically, I can up my left side to 33 and feel fine (was going to push it further), but any extra level there ups the right side by 1. And at past 24, the right side electric shock is way too much to handle, feels way stronger than the left one at 34. Not sure what the deal is to be honest.- Overall it's easy and convenient to wear, but I'm not feeling my abs getting much of a workout and the right side is shocking really hard beyond 24.AFTER 3 weeksI've been using this between 6 and 7 days a week with an occassional day that i use it twice.I contacted customer support and they were mildly helpful. Id say average, not great not terrible. I believe the pads that came with it have issues and thats why one side is getting stronger shocks. Ill update if they send replacements or not.Overall I've increased it to 60-50. At these levels you can feel yoir ab muscles contract. I still haven't been sore or any other feeling i get when really excercising the abs, so can't comment on the effectiveness.I'll keep using and give an assessment after 8 weeks.For now one of the pads wants to fall off and i expect it will have to be replaced soon. The sticky sides start losing stickiness and are harder to avoid removing it when tsking off the cover/plastic pads.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBUQA93WCAUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0YTB1K#wasThisHelpful","R3IBUQA93WCAUH","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent product, and depending on cost (still unclear at this time what it is going to cost) I would recommend it over the other typical BOSE speakers. I own 2 products of the BOSE Soundlink family. They are both $299, and can operate plugged in or via a battery.I want to get the bad things out of the way, because it really is a good speaker, and what I hope is the future sound systems. I was very interested in being able to listen to my Spotify playlist from the device for example. The device clearly lists Pandora and Spotify as systems you can use. But...Cons:- To listen to Spotify you require a paid subscription to spotify. If you are a casual Spotify users with a free subscription, you cannot use it with this product at all. And while this is more on Spotify than Bose, I think it's important to point this out, to avoid more frustrated users. If I were Bose, I'd make that clear on the product description. Again, requires a paid subscription to Spotify to work with this.- Soundtouch app is mediocre. Other reviewers are singing it praises, but that was not my experience at all. First off, you need to her very close to the device for it to work. Doesn't work from across a large room. In a bedroom it might be fine, but in the living room, one end to the other, the app didn't recognize the speaker (which was on and playing music). When I first download it, it took about 10 minutes to be functional. Upon opening the app, it stayed on with a ""downloading updates"" message on and I couldn't do anything.Once it was done downloading updates setting up the wifi to work with it was straight forward. The app itself is a little clunky and not polished at all. I'd consider the interface a step back in time. Lots of 3D effects and lights and animation, but little semblance of the user experience. Honestly, I rather use the remote that came with the product. The sound touch app is currently rated as 2.5/5 stars on the apple app store, so it's not just me who feels this app is mediocre. It's not horrible and you can still get your presets set up and system connected, but it's not a good experience.Ok, with the bad things out of the way, I wanted to point out why I still love this device.Pros:- No waiting for bluetooth. One of my pet peeves about the Bose Soundlink speakers is that sometimes they connect to my phone instantly and I can stream Spotify or whatever, but the other times, I spend 10 minutes and cannot get it to connect unless I do a hard reser of both the phone and the speaker to forget all devices then re-pair again. I have other bluetooth speakers that are much better at pairing than Bose. Either way, you still have to pair, and you still cannot talk on the phone while music plays through the speaker. This solves the issue. It connects to wifi and grants you access to your 6 most used settings instantly.- Pandora free can be used. I linked up my pandora account, and quickly filled 4/6 spots with different Pandora stations. Now I can get home, grab the remote and press the number 4 and start listening to my selected music. Didn't have to pick up my phone, hope bluetooth connects, open the pandora app on my phone, make sure the output is going to the Bose speakers and not my earphones or phone speakers.- You can still use bluetooth if you want. My biggest pet peeve, not able to use it with Spotify free, can be circumvented by using the bluetooth system. I haven't tested this enough to know if it's better than the awful bluetooth pairing on the Sounlink, but hopefully it's improved.- The sound is comparable to the Soundlink II. The size is very close too. This one is slightly larger, but not by much. But takes less space because it's not nearly as wide (you can tell from the picture, it's taller rather than wider).  It is very good and gets louder than I thought it would. I was not expecting it to get that loud. I preferred the sound from the Soundlink a tiny bit more, but it's very close in my non-audiophile opinion.Neutral and other observations- No batteries for this one. It must be plugged in to work.- Requires wifi for most of its features.- Requires an iOS or android device for setup through their mediocre sound touch app.- Remote battery included.- I hope they get more providers working for them. Right now its mainly Pandora (free or paid), Spotify (only paid version), iheartradio. Adding apple music, amazon prime music, and other popular music systems would be great. Being an amazon prime customer, I am bummed to not see prime music included here.Overall I can recommend this device to anyone who does not need it use it away from a wall plug. It eliminates the need for a smartphone whenever it is going to be used (requires it just for setup - or an android or apple tablet). If you love pandora, and hate setting up bluetooth pairing every time you get home, this is the way to go and hopefully more speaker systems will keep going this route.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7ZVOHTJVOO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH685E#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7ZVOHTJVOO5","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is very good and I can recommend to anyone.I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but I didn't like that not all the items were the washable variety, so I dropped a star from it. Particularly the crayons.Pros:- Washable markers- Minion carrying case is very colorful and sturdy enough to last a little while.- Plenty of items (colors, crayons, markers, coloring pages, and more)Cons:- Crayons are not the super washable variety, and if you've had to clean the regular crayola crayons of some light color surfaces you know it is no fun. (magic erasers help a lot - discovered it after trying a bunch of cleaners to no avail).Neutral:- The price is a little high, so there is a premium for the case itself. Most of the items inside can be had separately for $2 - $8 dollars. So if you find a good crayons and marker sale, you can buy the whole collection for just around $12 - 15 dollars excluding the coloring pages. Normal prices it's closer to $25-30.

"I'm honestly surprised at the high praise of these bars. So much, that I wanted to rate them as 1 star to start balancing out the praise a little. But overall, I feel these are a 2.5 star product, so I went high because the flavor is good.This review is in particular for the blueberry and acai dark chocolate and nut flavor. I have tried their blueberry/acai dark chocolates and those I'd rate higher than these bars.Lets start on a positive note.Pros:1. Good flavor.2. Crunchy but not too hard. (some nut bars are way crunchy and gooey, this is not one of them).3. Dark chocolate is very good quality.4. Ingredients are better than regular candy bars, no high fructose corn syrupHowever, the problem with these bars is they pretend they are some sort of healthy alternative bars, and they are far from it. Please read through the ingredient list (can be seen on the images on the product page itself). I'll list a few of the suspicious ones below.Cons:- No Acai. None. Not acai juice, not in the smaller ""less than 2% section"" not anywhere. They got nothing. I'm not sure how manufacturers are allowed to say these are blueberry and acai bars, when there is no acai at all. (there are blueberries...) This is false advertisement and lose 1 star for it.. Not ok for manufacturers to get away with this. If you do read closer, you'll see the bars claim it's just ""Acai flavor"" and not acai itself. But the product description in amazon does not make that clear at all.- The ingredients... IF this was labeled a candy bar, I'd give it a pass. But for a product trying to be healthy, just read through the list. Here is a highlight of some of them: In terms of sugars, it does a well job of covering them all: sugar, high maltose corn syrup, invert sugar, glycerin (maybe more a preservative than a sugar but still).- The blueberries and cranberries in the bar are sweetened. If it wasn't enough that fruits are naturally sweet, and dried fruit even sweeter, both the cranberries and blueberries have added sugar. Add to the fact that the bar already has tons of other sugars (in the chocolate, on the nuts, as the binding agent, etc, its another over the top sugar addition. This bar is a little too sweet because of all the sugar. 13g in total which is more than a glazed krispy cream donut (10g). Granted this is still less than a milky way or snickers bars which are close to 20g. Though they are also bigger in size.For what it's worth this product is manufactured by Hersheys.Overall, these bars taste good, and don't have high fructose corn syrup. Additionally they have less sugar content than candy bars, but overall not the healthy choice it tries to market itself as.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWEKIUCJX5F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BUDN5W#wasThisHelpful","R1XWEKIUCJX5F0","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Realistic- Change of clothes- chubby like most newborn babiesNeutral comments:Some reviewers said they got a baby with an open mouth instead of smiling. I am not sure it's just the odds or they changed the page to reflect it, but the description said smiling baby and I got smiling baby. Again, it could be a coincidence, or they updated the description to correctly reflect what baby you are getting.- knees/arms/legs etc don't bend at all. It is permanently with knees partially bent, same with elbows.- I think increasing the size to a more realistic 18-20 inches would've been good. This one is about 14 inches.Cons:- A little hard, would've been nice if the skin was a little bit soft.Daughter absolutely loves it (she isa few months shy of her 4th birthday) she can put on the diaper and play with it.The only downside is that it's not as comfortable to sleep with, like the previous baby she owned that was getting really dirty and broken down after 3+ years. That one was soft and she could snuggle it better. This one""pokes"" her.Overall I recommend this toy for any child that loves dressing up and playing with babies. It is more realistic than most baby toys, and the change of clothing and diapers is a good touch. Don't expect it to bend or be soft and cuddly though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9739OU8M02Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y7DQT8#wasThisHelpful","R3G9739OU8M02Y","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read before you buy. This might be good for what you want, or maybe not. It's hard to recommend without reservations.Pros:- The pattern is very cute and gender neutral- made from organic cotton.- All the seams and stitching is very well made, with no stranded strings or sloppy looking stitching anywhere (which is found in almost all inexpensive towels.- Generous size to really wrap up your child nice and cozy (up to about 6 months or so)- dries fastCons:- The towel is not as soft as you would think given the description and materials. In fact it's rougher than some of our adult towels here at home. It also gets rougher after a few washes.- Super thin. So while it might dry fast, it also gets soaked fast. Manufacturer claims it is very absorbent, while that might be true, most towels are twice as thick as this one, and as such about twice as absorbent.Neutral:- You might want to wash it alone, in cold water for a while and see if yours shed. We usually wash with whites and haven't noticed more than the normal brand new slight shedding, but other reviewers here have reported that, so it's worth keeping an eye out for it.Overall, it has a good price for an organic cotton towel, and if your baby has strong skin this will be a good choice/value.

"Of the 4 cases I have, this one ranks as the 3rd that I like the most. It's ok, but unless you like the color swapping it does, there really isn't much that stands out.Pros:- Case is slim. (2nd slimmest of my cases)- Sufficient shock protection.- Comes with a screen protector (I didn't think these were important, as I've never used them on my previous iPhones and never had a problem with glass screens, but my 6+ scratched the first month, no idea how, and hasn't scratched since I started using screen shields.- Cut outs are all in the right places- Price is very competitive and sometimes they have additional coupons (currently they have a 20% clip coupon)Neutral:- It comes with the 3 interchangeable plates. So if you have a gold colored phone, you can match it with the respective plastic plate.- Rubber around it is not as grippy as others.- I'd prefer the case to be single material, instead of having the insert for the different plates. It just looks not as smooth as a single surface would look. Some people might prefer the color options, but that's not for me.I give this product 3.5 stars, but given the good price, I rounded up to 4 stars.Overall, this is a good choice if you want a case that offers protection without much bulk. If you like the color options for the back plates, then this is the ideal product for you. If you don't care about that, there are other better choices out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQO56JR749SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIATJ3I#wasThisHelpful","R3HQO56JR749SP","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""wallet"" case has become my daily use case. I have used 4 different cases, but this one is my favorite.Pros:- Slim (all the ones I have are slim, but I've seen some huge cases, this is not one of them)- Cut outs and butts are on all the right places- Comes with a screen protector- Good quality stitching throughoutNeutral:- The pocket to store credit cards has gone completely unused. Some people might like it, but it only holds a couple of cards, and I just can't see myself not taking my wallet instead. The leather like material used there is of good quality as is the stitching on it.- The 2 position slot to use the case as a stand as well (with the use of a credit card or similar card) works fine. It holds the device in place, and depending if you insert the card horizontally or vertically it gives it a slightly different viewing angle. This to me was a missed opportunity to add an actual flip stand to it. The bulk from the credit card holder gives the devices plenty of space to add some sort of flip stand, instead of having you take out a credit card from your wallet and insert it there any time you want to use it as a stand. I hope they add a real kick stand on a future case.- The plastic material used, while of good quality is not as grippy as others. I got another case that has a more rubbery feel, and it's easier to grip. This might make it easier to slip inside pant/jean pockets, but I like how the other case feels more secure in my hands. This case is still more grippy than the naked phone, which is slippery.Cons:- No real big cons, just 2 minor issues discussed above in neutral.Overall this is a solid case for the iPhone 6 Plus, and I can recommend it. No wasted space for a ""wallet"" and a real kickstand would make the case better though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OC4QU6SSW4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQWIK5Y#wasThisHelpful","R32OC4QU6SSW4E","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly, this product is very close to 5 stars, I just felt the plastic bag was not very good quality so keep that in mind.Pros:- Price is very competitive with all other pellets per pound. One of the best- No weird fillers, just good wood usedNeutral- I like pellets for grilling - have used 2 different brands of pellets, with this one being the third. I have discovered that I am simply not that good as distinguishing differences between pellet flavors. They all taste the same to me. Slightly better than gas grills, that don't really add more than just fire flavor, but I cannot distinguish between different pellets.Cons:- With minimal handling I made a whole on the side of the bag, my finger went through as I was carrying it inside the house. Makes me think the plastic bag is of low quality.Overall, I can recommend these pellets for their great price and equal quality to other manufacturers.

"This is a good pillow for your little one.Pros:- Very cute. Close to what the images her show.- Good size (the picture with the baby is fairly accurate, I know many products that distort those to seem larger/smaller than what they are)- Very soft to the touchCons- there is virtually no support, so I can see the transition to sitting from lounging to be a struggle for a little one.Overall, if you child is yet to be born or very young (4 months or so) this is good lounging pillow for the first 9 months of a baby. It will be very  hard for a child to sit/learn to site with this pillow, since it's so soft and has almost no support. So keep that in mind.

"i have two other Gracco car seats including the Amazon best seller one - that goes for half the cost of this one. That one does not work for newborns though, as it's only front facing. So it's more 2+ years.I mention this because this is very similar to that one in terms of quality, even the colors are the same. The issue with this one, is that you likely are paying more for it than 2 car seats for infant and toddler+. The value of having just 1 car seat instead of two is mitigated by the high cost. It's as expensive as the Recaro car seat and those are clearly a step up in quality and comfort for the baby.This is still a very god car seat but it looks like they priced it higher than it should. At 200-220 dollars this car seat is well worth it. At 300 like it is priced today, you are better off buying 2 separate car seats, or spending the same for a better one like Recaro brand.Pros:- lasts forever- back and front facing as your baby grows- good quality materials- fairly easy to installcons- high price puts it in direct competition with other car seats that are better.- no resale value (since it lasts forever, you can't sell the infant one when you no longer need it) plastic is only good for around 6 years according to child safety information, so by the time you are done with this, it basically is trash.Overall though, I think Gracco will adjust the price down closer and make this a good value. as it stands, while a very good car seat, it's not the best quality for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAQFXSWYM3RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y286AHS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAQFXSWYM3RW","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a hard product to review. On the one hand, it feels like a solid overall product. But as a conscious buyer, the price of the product makes me dock a star. Here is the breakdown:Pros:- Does not use a propellant, it's just a simple spray.- Very easy to apply to your head (and unlike propellant based products, there is no gas cloud after you are done)- Does not turn flaky or greasy under weather conditions. When it's 100 degrees outside, some products become an oily mess, this one did not.- Easy to wash off at nightNeutral- It has a mild but present scent. I rather it was fragrant free, but it's not overpowering enough to warrant a negative rating.Cons:- At around $16, it's hard to justify over other products. There are competing products anywhere from $3-$40. But depends on what you need, some of the less expensive ones will do as good a job as this at keeping frizz under control and such (like Garnier Fructis products)OVerall, I'd rate this product at 4 star if you can find it under $10.

"Overall, this product is pretty good. Lets break it down:Pros:- List price is $6 dollars, but Amazon seems to carry it for around $3 sometimes (including as I am writing this review) and at $3 it's hard to find a better value for a body wash.- Some body washes are just that - this one is also a shampoo. Which was a nice bonus, since it's not very easy to spot that by just reading the product description.- Pleasant smell, not very strong, some fruit tones - I thought the lavender would stand out, but not as much.- Makes great lather, and leaves skin feeling cleanNeutral:- Strong purple color. Was kind of surprised. You definitely can tell how much you are using unlike some of the completely clear products. On the other hand, it's a lot of artificial color added.Overall, if you find this product for around $3-4 bucks, it's an excellent value.

"Simply great. I don't give 5 stars lightly, and this product deserves it, despite a few shortcoming. Sometimes sweeping and using the dustpan is an exercise in trying to get all the dust you accumulated into the dustpan. It's not always easy, you have to go multiple passes, and then at the end, you just know that little bit of dust just ain't going in, but at least you got most of it. This solves the issues, as virtually everything you go over gets immediately placed in a container/dustpan you can then empty.Pros:- Sweeping and collecting all the dirt has never been easier.- Picks up big chunks and small equally easily, and ""traps"" it in the dustpan.- Comes in a tiny box, that then you put together. The main pieces are aluminum, but there is a lot of plastic- Sweeps and collect really well.- Very light, glides on floor effortlessly.Neutral:- Just a warning - this product is not really meant to be used for cleaning a floor . Most swiffers I've used you want to moisten the floor, some even included a spray to get the floor went so then you can mop the surfaces with very little water. This one is the prior step. It's a broom and dustpan all in one.Cons:- Most of the pieces that make it effective won't last very long. I was checking the rubber parts, and while they work great now, they don't look like they will last very long. They might still be serviceable in a few months, but not with the effectiveness it has now.- Doesn't work as well with reusable pads - I tried one, and it seems like you would need really thin pads/wipes to be effective, and then you will lose the grip that these disposable ones have.Overall, I highly recommend this product.

"Overall these are a good way to store clothes and save space - taking a smaller bag.However, I was mildly disappointed to know that they do require a vacuum to be used. This is my fault, so I am not taking stars off because of it, but the product information has this statement:* ""Ideal for storing clothing. The travel bag does not require a vacuum and is a perfect fit for luggage.""I didn't real carefully enough, I figured the 3 were called travel bags, so I wouldn't need to use a vacuum to use it. Unfortunately, only 1 of the 3 is a travel bag, the others have different names and require vacuum use. On the plus side, they are made so that most vacuums that have attachments can be used, but I am not sure if all would work.As for the product themselves, its very clear plastic, and the instructions are printed right on the bags (so they are not totally clear, just clear with black instructions all over).It did help reducing the bulk that clothes/blankets make, and I can recommend the product.The sizes are fairly generous, unlike others that are too small.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GPR037NSAEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCMUDYW#wasThisHelpful","R23GPR037NSAEW","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was my favorite lens.However, after about 14 months of light use (maybe 300 - 500 pictures with it) the focus ring failed.I started digging information about this, and found out, that it's a relatively common problem with this particular lens.It's so common Canon knows exactly the cost to fix it, assuming you pay for all shipping, which totals to about $150 or so between insured shipping and the $100 dollar repair.While I would give the lens 5 stars based on overall performance - the way Canon handles a known problem with some of these lenses is deplorable, and as such I am giving it 1 star. If you are unfortunate like me, you'll have to spend another $150 to fix a known issue with the lens. It's a shame that Canon does not stand behind their products and provide a fix for a known issue with this lens for free or at a very low cost.Don't believe me, just google information about this lens and the focus ring problem.It just stops working for a few people, and if you are one of them, you are out of luck and out of money.I cannot recommend this lens, unless you want to roll the dice and hope you get one of the good ones, or that it stops working inside 1 year, then maybe they'll help.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5WQCFB40RZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009XVCZ#wasThisHelpful","R3N5WQCFB40RZB","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a tough product to review.On the one hand, they are good quality pistachios. They are sealed and fresh - crunchy enough so you know they were well packed.However, at a price of about $20 a pound, it's very hard to recommend unless you want the outmost convenience.Pros:- Flavor- Fresh- Price (really...)Cons:- You may eat too many, because without having to remove them from shell, they become so much easier to eat!- The above wasn't seriously a con - in case you have doubts.At first I thought shelled pistachios were more expensive than regular ones, with shell. Seem logical, someone goes through the process of shelling them, so it would be an added cost.So I did a test, and found out that shells account for about 47% - 49% of the weight in a pistachio. To make math simple and easier for anyone to find out which is less expensive, just pretend it's 50% of the weight - it'll come close enough.So basically, if a pound of shelled pistachios is $18, the pound of shell on needs to be around $9 to be equivalent.Occasionally you'll see shelled cheaper overall, and sometimes you'll see the shell on cheaper. But they hover around the same price per pound, and someone already shelled (and disposed of those shells) for you.Overall a good product, and surprising value. Look for it for close to $7 a pound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CEE3X84PC3JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOE88I0#wasThisHelpful","R2CEE3X84PC3JP","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ill update in a month.Initial impression has been fine. I just can't justify going higher now based on all the reviews.Pros:- Cord is thick - thicker than apple's or amazon basic cables.- The length of the cable.Cons:- People report issues within a month. I'll update my review up or down within a month.- Price. More expensive than almost all other competing products of the same length.Haven't had issues this week. Cables feels strong and sturdy so giving it 3 stars, because so far so good. It is expensive so it loses 1 star there. And if it lasts a few months of daily use (nightly charging with this cable) I might go up to 4 stars.

"Pros:- Light weight. At under 10 pounds, its very easy to maneuver.- Uses only 2 AA batteries (batteries included, I used regular rechargeable I already had)- 3 beams, I didn't test if they go all the way to- Amazon has it under $100 cheaper than other stores (home depot)- Carrying case (that stacks with other Bosch cases- sturdyCons:- Can't really see the laser outside. I was kind of hoping to use for a project outside, but it's not ideal for that - maybe in the winter time, but definitely not in the summer months.I'm happy with this laser tool, but a little bummed it's not made to operate outdoor under bright lights.

"While I prefer the sweet chile sauce, this one is not bad either.Note: the ingredient list is not great, so health nuts will keep away. But it's not terrible enough to keep me away.What these sauces do bring is:- quick flavor to your foods- large container- relatively inexpensiveThe sauce consistency is thick, but liquid enough to very easily come out of the bottle.Overall this is a good solution for busy families that don't go out of their way to always buy healthier options.

"Pros:- Lavender color- Soft initially at leastNeutral:- Made in China. It's just a little ironic that ""American Baby Company"" does not make their products here.- Average quality, average cost.- Save blankets for when they are older, not for infants.Cons:- American Baby Company seems unaware that the American Association of Pediatricians recommends against bumpers due to the risk of SIDS. Quoting from them (since you can't post links easily here): ""[…] there have been some published studies looking at bumper pads, and we concluded that if there’s no reason for them to be in the crib, it’s better to just have them out of there, particularly in light of the deaths that have been reported, that have been associated with the bumper pads""- Overall value based on the dangers of bumpers is not great.If you want average quality for average price, this is an ok set.

"Review of the Sweet Chili sauce:I've used this sauce a fair bit of time. Mostly as a stir fry. It has a nice sweet/tangy combination. If you like Chinese food sweet/sour sweet and a little spicy combinations, you will enjoy this sauce.The ingredients are not great - with plenty of sugars, including high fructose corn syrup, and plenty of salts, including calcium chloride. So obviously this is not for you if you are a health fanatic.Pros:- Good sweet/salty/mild spice balance.- thick- Huge (75 ounces is more than most juice bottle you buy, yeah that's half a gallon of it)Neutral:- Spice is very mild, so I'd recommend adding red pepper flakes and maybe some diced jalapeños if you like your food a little more spicy.- half a gallon of it - so you need to love it and figure out different ways to use it, or it'll be taking up valuable space in the fridge for months- It is a vegetarian/vegan product… but by no stretch of the imagination healthy.Cons:- Ingredients could be better, in particular high fructose corn syrup.Used in moderation this is a great and quick way to flavor food, I'd recommend adding more spice to it. Given it's price of around $12-$15 depending on subscribe and save and the half gallon size, it's a good value too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJPE76OD0Z5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFOA6K#wasThisHelpful","RHJPE76OD0Z5O","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We like this swaddling pouch. I'll contrast it to regular swaddle blankets.Pros:- Easy to put on. A regular swaddle blanket takes a little practice. Once you do it, it's relatively easy. But even then occasionally you put something not as tight, or an end is loose and it comes off. Also, when it's 3am and you are super tired, putting a swaddle on a baby that is not cooperating is a tall task. This pouch makes it all easy, easy to put on, easy to swaddle the baby, uses no brain power to get it on.- Soft fabric, seems and other parts are well put together.- Did I mention it's easy to put on?Neutral:- Thinner than I thought it would be. From pictures and others, I expected it closer to a blanket. But it's a little closer to a t-shirt in terms of thickness.Cons:- none so farOverall I can recommend this to any parent that will be swaddling their baby. The convenience of a regular blanket is worth the small premium.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ENORB1LQM1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V852S4C#wasThisHelpful","R6ENORB1LQM1F","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Sturdy- Comes in a tiny box, you just pull it out and add in the bottom part and its good to go.- Practical, and light- Soft cloth throughout- There are many other sizes from this brand to fit many needs and mix and match for what you wantNeutral:- Pictures here show the outside darker than it is in person. Not a stark differences, but it is noticeable.- Just wanted to note that the bottom is not attached. There is a cloth bottom that is attached, but the sturdy piece that matches the blue colors on the sides, is an extra piece you just place in there. It goes in easily, and the fit is good, so I'm not concerned of it coming out or falling. It also makes the box a lot sturdier by keeping not only the bottom, but the sides in place.- It feels like it's cardboard inside the cloth to provide the structure, this is fairly normal, but it means you probably want to avoid at all cost getting this wet. Note: I did not cut through the packet to know what it was, so feel free to correct me and I'll update the review.Cons:- none so farOverall, this is a good storage container.

"This review will be updated to see how well MoJack does with claims of something damaged. I am starting it at 3 stars and will update as I can put it together and based on their support.I was skeptical like most given the bad reviews, but the package arrived in good shape. Upon opening it, it's clear they have worked to improve it to prevent damage during shipment. Lots of cardboard and Styrofoam.Pros:- Looks high quality- Paint job (the red color) is very good- Fairly easy to install. My guess is that it takes 2 people about 30-45 minutes to put together. We would have finished it right around then if not for the missing pieces.- Customer support (ongoing, but they called me back first thing their next work day) is US based, and representative was very polite and helpful.Cons:- Lots of little imperfections. Given the cost of the unit, this is a let down.- For example the porcelain coated steel grates had several places where the coating was missing or chipped, and it went down to the steel. It wasn't just 1 place, it was like 8-10 places. They were small, but present throughout, so easy to spot.- The lid when you open and close hits some screws inside. There is some give like 1cm, if it's all the way to your right, it will barely touch the screw, but if it shifts to the left, you'll hit it very noticeably. Not a perfect fit. I looks at the culprit screws but they are in and as tight as possible, so there is nothing I can do to avoid the inside of the lid hitting the screws.- Part of the red paint has hit pieces of the black grill, and it's impossible to wash off - I tried.- temperature display is hard to see out in the sun.Neutral:- The packet with the screws inside it was open, and they were screws all over. Fortunately, they were all inside, but not sure if you will be so lucky.- Support is monday to Friday 8-5. So if you are putting together the grill on a Saturday and discover problems, or any day after work, you'll have to wait a little to find someone. (PS - have your serial number ready if you call)- If you come from the coal/gas grills, you'll be surprised (as I was) that it requires a power source to work. Not taking any stars off, because I've read that all pellet grills are like this, but from the pictures here you'll notice the power cable missing. Our back yard doesn't have an outside plug, so we'll have to figure something out to use it - a heavy duty extension cord or something. Either way, it's not very convenient to be dependent on a wall outlet.I'll update on cooking performance and other details when I get it working.Problem:- The 4 legs you assemble have a preinstalled ""teeth/place were screws go in to tighten"". I don't know the name of it, but 1 of the 4 legs was missing that. This is to make sure the legs don't wobble at the weight of the grill - which is around 120 pounds. So I couldn't install the grill because of this issue.- Inside the box was their phone number in very big letters asking to please call them if you have any issues with the grill. So I called them and left them a message.Update on support:- Sunday May 17th: Placed support call.- I got a call back Monday May 18th in the morning. The person was from the US, very polite and apologetic about the issue, and said they'd take care of it and send me another leg. I do need to give them the serial number for them to do this, so I'll need to call them again tomorrow with the number.- I didn't ask about the grates, but I'll ask next call, if that's within normal range, or if they will send new grates. I do want to point out that Monday-Friday 8-5 is very inconvenient - because they can help you with the install and other questions, but you have to take a day off work to be able to do that.Tuesday May 19th:- Called today with the serial number at hand, and gave the serial number to a lady (different support person). They had all my previously given information at hand, and she mentioned that they would call me back to complete the support. However, she noticed that the person that had helped me the previous day had gotten off the phone, so she would transfer me over.- I talked to the (customer service / support) again, and he was helpful again, determined which leg had the missing pieces, and said they'll package it up soon, so I can put it together. We will see how long it takes them to ship the part.- Additionally, I asked about the grates, and if that was expected. He said that those don't affect the performance of the grill, but since it's brand new, they wanted to make sure I didn't start with dinged grates, so they are sending those as well.- Overall I am very happy with the support so far, and I'll update the review and rating once I get to actually use the grill. I feel confident enough that I ordered some pellets already.Update: 06/01/15- The parts took about 7 business days to arrive ( they got here Thursday of the week after)- The grates arrived in about the same condition, so it's a general issue with a lot of their porcelain coating. I am not going to ask for another one. It's not terrible, just not what I'd expect. My older $199 grill had perfect porcelain coating.- I proceeded with the install and it was going fine. Fired it up, it started turning slowly, a little warm and then it all stopped working. The power turns on, but the fan and auger stopped turning on, temperature dial disappeared.- I tried a few things and no luck.- I called support again, and as mentioned, they only work M-F so had to wait until Monday. I went home during lunch and when I talked to them I went about trying to fix the issue.- The support guy was again very courteous and apologetic for the issues. He was helpful and guided me through using a spare fuse that comes with the unit. He guided me to replace it, and I managed to do it fairly easily.- The fan kicked in and temperature dial started working again. I was relieved, however upon testing it we found out it was not heating up or smoking or anything. Completely cool to the touch. They are sending me more replacing parts with more detailed instructions on how to fix the issue.- At this point, given all the poor reviews in Amazon, in addition to some positive ones coming up, I have a hard time recommending it. Spent way too much time fixing issues already, and about to spend even more time - who knows how long it'll take to replace that heating element, does not seem like it will be simple.I'll keep updating as I work on getting this going, but it's hard to recommend it at this point. It's a lottery, you might get a good unit or one with plenty of problems and then spend many frustrating hours troubleshooting the grill. I am giving it 2 stars because their support has been great despite limited hours. But nobody wants to deal with trying o get a grill working, and they haven't really offered anything extra for my troubles. Just more replacement parts for me to work on grill.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI5XQO2NF6ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMAPD74#wasThisHelpful","R3FI5XQO2NF6ZY","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- very vibrant colors- cute giraffe pattern- folds to a small square. It is way more bendable than I thought- the very rubbery material stays put on most any surface- easy to clan, virtually just wipes off- the rubber seems of good quality. Haven't noticed any signs that it will break when bendingNeutral:- while the vendor makes a point of emphasis in the corner ring, we did not find this feature really practical. Putting that as neutral because it doesn't take much room, but for us it's not really and advantage.Cons:-  relatively pricey- the paint on the face of the giraffe was a little off, hard to explain but one of the cheeks was not smooth. You can't really tell unless you hold it on the light, but wanted to point it out just for information. This is minor, and does not detract from it.Overall this is a nice place mat, easy to clean, easy to take with you, and the rubber keeps it in place.

"I am reviewing the product now, but hope I'll update in a couple of months to just update and comment on how it seems to have worked or not.Pros:- Does not leave hair greasy or any other signs of a product being on it. You don't have to worry if you have to leave in 20 minutes after applying product. Just keep cap on for 5-10 minutes after applying, and then you take it off and style your hair however you want.Neutral:- ""Activator cap"" Is a really funny term for a simple shower cap. Really, it is identical to any plastic shower cap. It really is just a clear shower cap.- This product does not detangle hair or anything extra.Cons:- Not sure if it works...That's why it's hard to recommend. Maybe I'll notice the difference more in a few days, or something. I followed the directions carefully. Washed hair, dried to the point where it was a little damp not wet, then proceeded to apply a whole vial. They recommend from half to a whole one depending on hair. Given that I have very thick hair and long, I thought a full vial make sense.The problem is, My hair doesn't really feel any different. I have never dyed my hair or permed or anything so maybe it helps more if you have really damaged hair from treatments? Anyhow, at this point hard for me to recommend the product.Note:If you read this review later than July 1, 2015 and I haven't updated, please comment below and I'll get a notification so I can update the review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVZ7CHDQAIK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYZY5XU#wasThisHelpful","RCVZ7CHDQAIK6","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These come in one huge bag. It's not several smaller bags, or something. The pieces as all jolly ranchers, are individually wrapped.Pros:- They actually surprisingly kind of taste like raspberry.- Sweet, but acidic too. A very nice flavor- Pros, last a good time in your mouth, it dissolves slowly, so you get to enjoy the candy longer.Neutral/Notes:- over 400 pieces in the bag. (They claim around 417 based on serving size. I haven't gone in and counted them all)- Leaves your tongue blue- Ingredients include: corn syrup, sugar, various colorants, ""artificial flavors"", malic acid.Cons:- 11g of sugar and 17g of carbs per serving. Serving size is 3 candies.I prefer healthier candy myself, but as you can tell by the 4 star rating, I don't go overboard with it. This is a nice sweet and sour candy with mild raspberry flavor. I am not fan of regular hard candy - the kind that is all sweet. That tastes horrible to me. But the acidic sweet and sour taste of these is great.

"I need to second other review here and repeat again, how misleading the picture is. The hamper is all cloth. It does not stay up right or perfectly cylindrical like in the picture. It's like a thick jacket. It'll lay completely flat on the floor. I repeat again, this does not stand by itself.Pros:- Fabric quality is good, it's thick, and it's well woven together. There are no loose threads or markings of sloppy stitching. It is well put together.- Since it's fabric, you can run it through the washer for cleaning.Neutral- You can take it with you, if you want to have a hamper in your travels. Since it folds up.Cons:- No support structure anywhere. Lays flat on the floor. Very misleading picture.- Very small. The name ""hamper"" gave me the impression that you could store lots of dirty clothes, like most hampers. But in reality, this is just very small. It won't store more than 2 days of clothes for a couple of people.- They say ideal for storing toys in the packaging too… But again, this is not ideal for it,  because it does not hold its shape. The only time it kind of holds a cylindrical shape is when it's full to the brim.Overall, it's hard to figure out a good audience for this product. As a hamper, you have to straighten and open it up every time you want to put something inside (since it just folds in itself). So it's not very convenient. It's also small, so it won't help you store much either. So at this point, I cannot recommend this product to anyone looking for a hamper. The only exception might be heavy travelers that would like to have a hamper to put on their dirty clothes on their short trips.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QW7ZT8R85SDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5ZIXTK#wasThisHelpful","R3QW7ZT8R85SDQ","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Huggies pack, is a nice gift for new parents, but it seems like you have to watch the price and probably use subscribe and save to get the best deal on them. Under $30 or close to it (including subscribe and save discount) is a good price.Since the product page is kind of confusing with a ton of details, I wanted to give a quick breakdown of exactly what you are getting. So the 5 items are:- 1 Newborn diaper pack (32 total diapers)- 2 packs of size 1 diapers. (70 total diapers, 35 per pack)- 1 pack of baby wipes (216 natural wipes)- 1 reusable plastic container to keep wipes moist (and be able to buy cheap bulk packets)In addition to those 5 items, it comes packed in a box like you see in the picture. It's cute and gender neutral, you can probably even get away without having to wrap this as a present.Additionally, the diapers (little snugglers) are actually pretty good.1. Comfy and soft2. Wetness indicator (new parents will appreciate this)3. breathable fabric4. The newborn diapers have a little cut out for the healing umbilical cord. (nice touch)Cons:- Expensive if you are counting the price per diaper.Overall, I give this 4 stars, because it's not a great value.

"Finally. Please make sure you are getting the Avent Classic Plus, instead of the Avent Classic themselves.I used to have the regular Classic, and though they were good baby bottles, they were annoying to clean and put together. And when we had an aunt or grandma taking care of my daughter, there would be the inevitable spill/mess because they didn't see that extra little piece you put to seal the bottle.The Classic Plus finally gets rid of that extra piece. Now you have less to clean, no chance of someone forgetting an extra piece and causing a mess, so basically... they fixed it.Pros:- Few pieces. Just the necessary ones!- Means less to bottles to clean- Good quality plastic and nipplesNeutral:- BPA Free etc. Put this in neutral because I haven't seen a baby bottle that has BPA in the last dozen years or more.- I am not fond of the transparent pink background. It's just a little odd, prefer them clear myself. But that is just a preference.Cons:- None. They finally fixed the annoying 5th piece bottle and made it into your core 4 pieces. (Nipple, nipple holder, bottle, and cap)Overall, I can finally recommend the AVENT Classic Plus without hesitation. Just make sure you don't confuse them for the regular AVENT Classic ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DDZT7XETD7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8AA1Q#wasThisHelpful","R36DDZT7XETD7H","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are among the best and most convenient ones you can use. Though also the most expensive given that these are basically single use shells. Other diapers use inserts, that are single use and inexpensive, and the shells, that you can use multiple times.Pros:- Convenient (easy to put on and off - just one strap.- Snaps are easy to clean and don't get stuff stuck like velcro.- Pattern colors are good quality and should last through the wash.- Can add inserts for me water absorbency.- Not very bulkyNeutral:- Fit is ok, given the AIO size. About average. (not the best, not the worst)Cons:- Basically just single use then you have to wash. So you need to buy a lot of these unless you plan to do laundry every day or twice a day just with diapers.Overall, if you want convenient diapers, these are a good choice. If you want to save money, there are better options which rely more on the inserts than the whole diaper to keep fluids in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T11ZKCH0RFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVZ9F1O#wasThisHelpful","R2T11ZKCH0RFP","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used these for my first daughter, and we got another on the way which will get to use these now too. We used the small size version. These are the new newborn type, a little more snug for little ones.Pros:- Snaps are easy to use and don't get damage/messy like velcro. I suggest snaps over velcro for these diapers. Besides, if they is an accident, velcro is very hard to clean (and sometimes stains stay...). The plastic snaps are super easy to clean.- The main difference for newborn diapers compared to the previous small size ones, is the umbilical cord snap down. It's a minor detail that makes a big difference. Sometimes the stump is a little big and diapers can hit it and irritate it. These have an optional snap that you snap down to it, leaving the umbilical cord stump free and avoiding unnecessary rubbing of it.- Very easy to put on/off.- Outer layer is plastic and rarely gets dirty.A note on when to try cloth diapers:When they are a newborn is the best time to start cloth diapers. Their body fluids at this point do not smell very bad, and it will ease you in. As long as they are fed mostly breast milk, you'll be surprised how little they smell - even number 2. If/when they start drinking formula, you'll notice a smell right away. Once solid food start, is when the fun really begins :)Basically, if you are unsure about cloth diapers - better to start early as once the solid food start the smell might dissuade you…Overall, these are a good way to test to see if cloth diapers are for you. Not very expensive, easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ED4M4HROF2M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKPOENQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ED4M4HROF2M1","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stapler offers great value.Pros:- Inexpensive (given the quality)- Material (plenty of heavy duty metal)- Easy to useNeutral:- It's quite heavy. You can tell its heavy duty, but just wanted to point out here, that it's heavier than it looks. Took me a little by surprise.- In addition to staples, it can use a couple of types of nails. I haven't tested those, but the package had that labeled and offered details on it. Here in the website I do not see any reference to that.Overall, this product is a no brainer for those who want a quality product without spending too much money. You can buy a cheaper one, for $5 to $10 dollars, but it won't last as long, won't be as effective and you'll end up spending two to three times as long trying to get they job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFZU8IYS9PD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406WX1O#wasThisHelpful","RFFZU8IYS9PD3","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This car seat is very close to a 5 star product, and I have no problems recommending it.Pros:- Lots of cushion.- Removable/attachable head rest (read cons about it though)- Fabric is of good quality- Moves from rear facing to forward facing (from infant to a little beyond toddlers - 50lb)Neutral:- The colors didn't quite match the pictures. It says I got the Atlantis but the bluish/green color is not nearly as vibrant as in the pictures. Just thought I'd point this out. I still like it, and this did not affect the rating.- Though it works for an infant, It's not really infant friendly. Most people (myself included) prefer the seats that detach from the base. This is so you can pick up your baby while they are asleep. They stay in the ""car seat"" which you can hold, and the base stays in the car. It's much easier to sit them in the car seat in your home, then take them to the car and snap in place.Cons:- The removable head rest is a little flimsy, and I'm unsure if it actually helps. It doesn't really offer much support or structure. It just kind of flails to either side. If the headrest was better, I would have given the product 5 stars. I don't like to see my child with her head all bent or twisted when she falls asleep. We have a carseat (recaro brand) that has a really nice head rest, and she never has her head all bent on weird angles. It however, costs nearly 3x as much as this one. That said, sometimes it holds her head in place, but most times it's not.- Does not reclineOverall, this carseat is better than all others I've seen on this price range. It has more cushion, the fabric seems of better quality, the buckle works well, and it includes a detachable head rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTOA80JAW5T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RQTW4#wasThisHelpful","RPTOA80JAW5T2","A2SLX6UHHYCMCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLX6UHHYCMCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a wedding photographer and often spend 8-12 hours on my feet without sitting down for the vast majority of the day.  I need shoes that look good and that are comfortable.  I don't mean ""comfortable for a dress shoe"", I'm talking about tennis shoe-like comfort.  These shoes fit the bill and look great.  They fit as expected and comparably to other dress shoes I've had in the past.Right out of the box I would rate these shoes as being very comfortable for dress/work shoes, but not quite on the level of an athletic shoe.  I added a set of insoles in the shoe and now they're quite soft - which is just how I like them.After a long day, I find that I'm less fatigued in these than I was in my old set of Docker's.

"I have been searching forever to find an appropriate armband for my Sansa Zip Clip MP3 player.  The original band had long since worn out and I was searching for a replacement.The issues I was running into were either that the arm bands were too short to fit around my arm or too wide for the Zip Clip to attach.  This arm band fits perfectly.  It is exactly 1-3/16"" wide (not 1"" wide like the description claims), which allows the Zip Clip to fit snugly over the band with minimal play.  The band is also 19"" long and will fit the vast majority of arm sizes - even large ones.  Fully extended with no stretch, this band will accomodate a 17"" arm.  Taking into account the stretching of the elastic within the band, fitting a 20"" arm is most likely possible  Fully wound up, the band should fit arms as small as 8"" in circumference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGS0TKIUZPGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AZJBYC#wasThisHelpful","R3VGS0TKIUZPGW","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a 32 year old athletic male, I may or may not be the target demographics for this product.  I can confirm though that I used this product as directed and it definitely did not provide all day odor protection.  This is a twice a day product for people like me.

I've never had underarm acne in my entire life until I started to use this product.  In fact, I really don't have sensitive skin at all and it's rare to find any product which irritates me.Switching deodorants to Arm and Hammer naturals, all of the acne and rashes went away.

"My wife and I bought a jug of the vanilla caramel.  I've been buying protein powders for the past 20 years or so and this might be the single most offensively tasting product I've ever had. The only thing that might come close is the soy proteins circa 1998.  It's so bad, I simply cannot eat it.  I've never (ever) thrown out a jug of protein powder before, but if my wife doesn't finish the jug, I will be throwing it out.The product itself does what it's supposed to.  You mix 3oz of water for every scoop of powder and stir into a bowl.  After a minute or so, the mixture becomes thick and takes on the consistency of a pudding.  It looks and smells appealing.  It even initially tastes good once you start eating it, but shortly after that you get hit with a strong chemical (artificial sweetener) flavor that is simply overwhelming.  It's bad to the palate and honestly makes me a bit sick.  I've tried it on a couple different occasions and it never got any better for me.If you are absolutely bent on buying this product, I would suggest buying a different flavor.  It could just be that the vanilla caramel is that awful and that the other flavors are better.  That said, an even better suggestion would be trying another product all together.  I use Body Nutrition's ""Trutein"" protein powder and I find it excellent - both in texture and in taste.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH40HRFML5USX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J43Y7FI#wasThisHelpful","RH40HRFML5USX","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a perfect fit for my model MB1001 magic bullet blender.

They are a blunt, straight edge.If you are looking to use this replacement blade for heavy duty cutting and chopping, it probably won't work as well as the original, so beware.

"I drive a 2006 Acura TL with a manual transmission.  The third gear synchros in this car have been faulty for a long time.  You basically have to rev-match your third gear upshift into this car or the transmission simply will not engage third gear.  It will just bounce right out of the gate.  This is a well known and much maligned design fault of this car's manual transmission.  I've modified my shift technique to avoid the issue for a while, but it was becoming more problematic over time.I replaced my 2.5 year old, Acura manual transmission fluid (with 25k miles) with this GM synchromesh fluid and it made all of the difference in the world.  Shifting normally there are NO problems engaging third gear anymore.  I occasionally get a very minor resistance going into third gear, but it has not once popped out like it used to.  I would honestly note about a 90% improvement in the function of 3rd gear now.Whereas previously I was seriously considering a multi-thousand dollar rebuild of the transmission, instead a $50 fluid change was all I really needed.  This fluid is outstanding and vastly superior to what Honda recommends that I put into this car.  I couldn't recommend it more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20MYKJO3M63BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026JK8FK#wasThisHelpful","R20MYKJO3M63BX","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this tool to replace the transmission fluid in my 2006 Acura TL.  The fill bolt in this car is on the top of the transmission, which sit about a foot beneath the airbox under the hood of the car.  This tool reached down to fit into the fill hole perfectly.  Another nice feature is that the hose is rigid enough that it will sit up on its own without you having to hold it continually with one hand.  So when you put some fluid in, then go to check the fluid level underneath the car, the tool will sit upright and not leak fluid all over the place.Another great feature of this fill tool is that it has a cap for both ends.  This is SO nice.  I have a number of funnels and fill tools in my garage and one thing that makes them messy is they leak after you're done with them.  Fluid drips from both end of the device and gets everywhere.  With this tool you can cap off both ends once you're finished so there are no leaks.Although I didn't use it, the measuring and cutoff feature is quite nice.  If you know that your car holds 2.3 quarts of fluid you can put two full quarts in there, turn the flow off, measure 0.3 quarts of fluid in the reservoir, then turn the flow back on.  That way you know exactly how much fluid you put in your car.This tool was far superior to thank of a regular long-neck funnel for a transmission fluid change.  I'm glad I picked one up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340JBQYTQC4YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EH4V0Y#wasThisHelpful","R340JBQYTQC4YZ","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The issues I have with it are that the glass bulb seems to stain easily - either with soap or with water.

"I recently bought a Canon 24-70/2.8 II that did not come with a lens hood.  I did a lot of research on third party hoods before finally settling on this one.  I am an experienced professional photographer and I've been using Canon equipment for the past 12 years.  I have the Canon 70-200 F2.8 II lens which has an identical hood type (not design) to the 24-70/2.8 II.I can state unequivocally this hood is NOT identical to the Canon version and is no where near as high quality.  Prime differences are:- This lens hood does not have the felt on the inside of the hood to prevent reflections. It is a bare, matte plastic.  Probably good enough, but definitely a cost cutting measure.- This hood has some minor resistance when putting it on the lens, which might or might not loosen over time.  Again, indicative of looser quality controls on the third party hood.- This hood has a plastic locking mechanism instead of the metal spring used on the Canon hood.  This is the big one for me.  This third party hood will unquestionably be less durable in it's locking feature versus the genuine Canon hood.  The Canon hood snaps positively into place and does not move.  This hood also snaps into place, but less securely and will move from its locking position with only moderate effort.So overall, for about 1/6th the price of the genuine Canon hood, this hood is a good buy.  It's not as good as the Canon piece, but will protect your lens elements just the same and that is primarily what I bought it for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXS6EXOSG3D1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D53LT72#wasThisHelpful","RXS6EXOSG3D1C","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been pouring over this monitor for the past day or so and I've been very impressed.  For starters, this monitor works flawlessly at full, stated resolution on Windows 7 64 bit.  I have a Radeon R260X video card and literally after plugging it in using  Displayport 1.2, it worked perfectly with no fiddling with hardware or software settings.My first impressions of viewing the monitor are:- Wow, it's sharp- Wow, it's vivid- Wow, everything is small nowFor some background, I've been using a Dell 3007FPW for the past 7-8 years for professionally editing photos.  I generally consider this monitor to be the best computer accessory I've ever purchased.  Going from the 3007 to this monitor is a revelation. I would describe the experience as as having poor vision your whole life, then putting on glasses for the first time and immediately having 20/15 vision.  The clarity, vividness, and sharpness of the screen is really breathtaking.There is so much resolution here you almost have to change the way you use monitors.  With most screens you view at a normal distance and that is that.  With this screen you can view at a normal distance and everything looks great.  However when you lean in and squint at the screen instead of just seeing pixels (with most normal screens) all you see is more detail in your images.  It adds another dimension to screen viewing.  That said, if you have less than ideal vision, I'm not sure I would even bother with this monitor.At normal viewing distances, text will probably look a bit small for most people.  You can use built-in Windows scaling to fix this.  You can also use independent font scaling in your web browser as well. This fixes 90% of the ""small text"" issues for me.  By default, I've found the monitor to be too bright as well.  After reducing brightness a bit and scaling font, the monitor is a real treat to use and look at.Here are two potential issues I've found so far:***Monitor to computer communication***  There is a USB 3.0 cable which connects the monitor to the computer.  This serves the function of sending monitor hardware information to the computer as well as to act as a USB 3.0 hub for the 3 ports on the back of the monitor (which are a complete pain to get to).  I can confirm that the monitor functions perfectly as a USB 3.0 hub, but the monitor does not seem to be sending proper hardware information to the computer.  LG includes ""True Color Pro"" software for tweaking and calibrating the screen and this software requires the hardware information from the monitor in order to work.  Without a properly functioning link between the computer and monitor, you cannot use this software.  So for now, I'm using the default calibration.It's also important to note at this point that this monitor comes factory calibrated for color temp, gamma, and color accuracy.  You get an individual calibration report for your actual monitor from the factory.  The calibration spec from the factory is already so impressive that I'm inclined to just leave it alone.  Goodbye Spyder 3 Pro.***Screen flickering***  Every 10-15 minutes or so the monitor screen will go black, then come back a second or two later.  I'm not sure what this is about, but it has me a little concerned.  I'm also noticing some localized color noise which happens far less frequently and lasts for only a fraction of a second.  This could be an issue with the monitor, or an issue with the DP cable or connection.I will keep this review updated as the potential issues play out, but for now the monitor seems to be a winner for me.**11/14/14 UPDATE**Talking to both LG Tech support and another source online, it seems as if DP 1.2 cables can be flaky at 4K 60z because at this setting they are pretty much maxed out in terms of bandwidth.  They are on the outer fringe of their specification and any variation in tolerance is going to cause a problem with performance.Since then, I've reduced the refresh rate of the monitor from 60hz to 50hz and so far have had no screen flickering.  For me, there is no noticeable performance difference between 50hz and 60hz so for now all is good.**12/10/14 UPDATE**I'm sad to say that I'm packing up the monitor and sending it back for a refund.  There have been a number of issues which give me pause about keeping the monitor long term.For starters, the flickering has come back - even at 50hz over DP 1.2.  This seems to only happen after using the monitor for several hours - so heat could be an issue (maybe).  At one point yesterday I even got 4-5 flickers over a 10 minute period.  I can put up with one here and there, but this is unacceptable.Secondly, on starting the monitor I've heard a loud ""knocking"" coming from the rear of the monitor upon first booting the computer.  It almost sounds like plastic creaking loudly.  One of the two times this caused the monitor to cycle power and the other time it caused a row of pixels on the lefthand side (maybe 30 pixels) to turn to color static.  I had to turn the monitor off, then turn it back on to remedy the issue.So basically with all things considered, I am regretfully giving the monitor up.  It is still absolutely gorgeous to look at, however there are still a few bugs which need to be worked out before I can fully recommended it for serious professional use.  For now I'm going back to my trusty Dell 30"" which as been a rock solid work horse for the past 8 years.For me the wait continues for the perfect 4K computer monitor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RID8NC3FSV6I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKSEVTY#wasThisHelpful","RID8NC3FSV6I1","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My perspective may be a bit different than many.  I bought this TV to use for photo slideshow presentations.  I don't have any 4K video content, but I do have lots of still images which are much higher than 4K.Here is my experience:**IMAGE QUALITY**4/5  This was the main reason for me buying the TV and so far I've been happy with it.  Predictably, images look breathtakingly sharp and beautifully clear and saturated on this TV.  The panel does not distort color when viewing off-axis, but it does lose some contrast fairly quickly if not looking directly at it.  There are MANY different color and picture adjustments and with some fiddling, you will be able to get close to the ideal image with this TV.  There is some color inaccuracy in the saturation of some subtle greens and reds, but I consider this a minor issue.  Overall the picture will not compare to a calibrated IPS computer monitor, but is still excellent for a TV and sufficient for professional image slide shows.**BUILD/DESIGN**5/5  The TV is slimly designed with beautiful touches all around.  The screen has a non reflective matte finish, the bezels are thin, and the inputs are easily accessible from the righthand side of the TV.  It is also pleasantly light for a 50"" 4K television.**SOFTWARE/CONTROLS**4/5  The controller for the TV functions in two different ways - with traditional buttons and via a built-in IR pointer.  You can point at the screen and click on things similar to how you would a computer mouse, but I find the accuracy of the pointer to be lacking.  Maybe it needs calibration or maybe I just need more practice.  However I find the pointer fairly tedious to use.  The buttons, however, are top notch and very responsive.The TV also has a slew of built-in smart features with many apps for content viewing and gaming.  Though I don't intend on using this part of the feature set, I was very impressed with the content and functionality relative to our other smart TV here at home (which is a Vizio).The TV allows for media (video, photo) via inputs on the back of the TV.  It has two USB 2.0 inputs, one USB 3.0 input, and several others.  I use a USB 3.0 flash drive for viewing photo and video on the TV.  Video playback is exceptional and just as smooth/streamlined as any smart phone or tablet you will find.  Photo slideshows are good, but not great - the downfall is in the software.  With a photo slideshow you can hit ""play"" and let the TV scroll through the images at a fixed rate (slow, med, fast), or you can manually scroll through them with the remote.  My biggest complaint is that the maximum speed of the slideshow is too slow.  Even on ""fast"" mode, the TV displays each image for 5 seconds.  If you choose to manually advance the images, the fastest you can scroll through them is one image every two seconds.  I can press the forward button 5x on the remote, but I'll only get one image advance every two seconds.  This makes it awkward and tedious to get through large numbers of images.  One work around would be to use a laptop and video-in to the TV, but I would lose the beautiful 4K resolution that way.In summary, I find this to be a fantastic smart TV with a picture which is great for general viewing though slightly sub-par for color critical display work.  However my usage is fairly specialized.  Given the exceptional design and price of the TV, I really find it hard to fault as-is.As a side note, I bought mine used through ""Amazon Warehouse deals"" for about $300 less than retail.  If you choose to go this route, get a TV with original packaging.  I ordered a repackaged TV the first time around and it came badly damaged due to poor packing by Amazon.  The original Samsung packaging of my second TV was much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2IFW7T6ULN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSBB7FI#wasThisHelpful","RG2IFW7T6ULN4","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I bought this product I actually went to a local hardware store and bought the 7508 burner set (which was Genuine Weber).  Much to my chagrin, these burners were about 1"" shorter than the ones I needed - which were the 7506 Burner set.Moral of this story - MEASURE your burners before you place an order.  The two sets look the same, but aren't.Ok now onto this product.  I was a little surprised to see that this burner set was almost literally identical to the Weber set I had purchased a week before.  I saw no reason to pay twice as much for the Weber brand burners when I could make no difference between the two sets.As others have mentioned, I can confirm these burners are maybe 1/4"" shorter than the original 7506 burners.  This was a small enough difference that I had no problem fitting them into my grill securely.  The support platform for the end of the burners had enough dead space on it that a 1/4"" shorter burner still fit with no issue.  The new burners brought life to my aging weber grill and helped me put off buying a new grill.  Overall a great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZH2CRN7XNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O150ES#wasThisHelpful","R2XZH2CRN7XNP","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll start off with the bad.  My computer did not like this enclosure over ESATA.  I run a P8P67 LE motherboard (with built-in Esata) on Windows 64 bit.  The computer would recognize all four drives and transfer data just fine for 30-40 minutes, then freeze up.  Cycling power on the enclosure did not help.  I had to reboot the computer to get it to come back.  I could then transfer data for another 20 minutes or so before another freeze up.  Now before I get too hard on this product, let me say that this issue might very well be an incompatibility with my ESATA controller.  The motherboard is 4 years old, so who knows.After switching to USB 3.0 the enclosure has been absolutely flawless.  I run this enclosure with (4) 4TB WD green hard drives and have not experienced a single hiccup. It took probably 2 days to transfer all of my data over to the drives and had no errors or malfunctions at all over USB 3.0.  I have been using it ever since then to backup data and have been very pleased.The product itself is designed very well and is remarkably easy to install and remove drives.  All you do is screw a small plastic bracket onto your hard drives, then insert them into the enclosure.  Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was transferring data onto the drives.  Setup really could not have been easier.My impression of this drive after reading all of the reviews and using it myself is that it *may* be picky with interface controllers.  If for some reason it doesn't like your ESATA or USB 3.0 controller, you may need to get an add-in card for it to work properly.  Unfortunately this is a result of fragmented technology and is the nature of DIY computers.  Once you find a controller it likes, the drive is super easy to use and rock solid in its operation.  Fully recommended from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLM3MZUK7B40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X26VV4#wasThisHelpful","R2XLM3MZUK7B40","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The big problem with using LED lights for photo and video work is color fidelity.  Almost all of them have some sort of nasty color cast that remains on the image after it has been color corrected.  This is due to the non-linearity in which it emits its color spectrum.  This ""quality"" of light is reflected in the CRI - or ""color rendering index"".  Sunlight is a perfect 100, and most other forms of light are lower than this.  Any LED light which does not advertise a CRI is probably a pretty bad light, so buyer beware.  This light claims a CRI of over 92, which is impressively good.A few years back I bought a $40 LED light here off Amazon and it was just terrible.  It left a nasty green cast to the images which made them only good for black and white. I literally used it once, then sold it - swearing off LED lights for serious photo work for nearly three years.  Since then I've been using incandescent video lights for low-light photo work and have generally been happy.  The issue with these, however, is that they are limited in output, have a fixed color temperature, and are power hungry.  They were relatively inexpensive, very portable, and had decent (but not perfect) color - so they were good enough.With the impressive specs of this light, I decided to venture back into LED lighting.  After a couple wedding shoots with this, I am impressed with the light.  They get fairly bright, use very little power, and have lots of great features such as a dimmer, color temperature variability (3200k to 5600k), and battery meter (YES! Finally).I am also happy to report that unlike cheap LED lights of yesteryear, these have decent color.  After some investigation, I suspect the >92 CRI rating is for the 5600k setting, not the 3200k setting, though.  The color quality at 5600k seems to be quite good, while I can report a noticeable - though not terrible - red color cast at the 3200k setting.  Keep in mind that this is going to result in a green tint to the backgrounds when color correcting this light at 3200k.  Depending on the nature of what you photography, this might or might not be an issue for you.  For me, it's not ideal, but not a deal-breaker either.Given the features, versatility, and quality of the light, I'm willing to let the slight red cast at 3200k slide with a 1/2 star deduction.  I'm definitely keeping the light and even thinking about picking up another one.  For me, this light is a game-changer for low-light events and portraiture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUX9I4QOG2E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FL7LLZA#wasThisHelpful","R2WUX9I4QOG2E7","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this is a beautiful shirt.  It has a very small pitch pinstripe which is very subtle and can only be seen on close inspection.  It's a nice detail that looks really good.  It also has a slight sheen to it that gives it a nice look over what would be a plain grey shirt.  The shirt feels put together well and of very high quality.My only qualm with the shirt is that it definitely is not slim fit.  I ordered a 32/33, 16-1/2"" shirt and have 42"" shoulders and a 33"" waist.  I have found there is a fair amount of loose material around the midsection, which is slightly disappointing.

"I bought these to increase my signal with the Asus N66u router, but unfortunately they didn't work out for me.  My cable comes in the house in my office, which is upstairs to the far right corner of the house.  My Vizio smart TV in on the ground floor at the far left corner of the house.  So basically this is the worst wi-fi configuration possible for signal strength.  Right now I'm using a repeater to get a reliable signal to the smart TV and it's working well.  I'd like to ditch the repeater and just use the wireless router in the office to the entire house.This is where the antennas come in.My connection is 50mbs/11mbs Comcast cable and has been very reliable.  These are the signal tests I performed using the ""wifi signal strength"" app on my HTC One Android phone.  I held the phone up near the TV (with the repeater unplugged).  Note that this is a ""worst case"" scenario for wifi in my home, but unfortunately its exactly the scenario needed by my smart TV in order to stream video.Stock N66u antennas: -68dB, 20mb/s download speed  (test completed without error)Super Power Supply antennas:  -74dB, 3.5mb/s download speed  (test actually errored out before completion)So with the ""upgraded"" antennas (positioned identically to stock antennas), I lost about 6dB of signal strength and a significant amount of speed to my wireless connection.  I tried a couple other antenna positions to see if I could improve reception, but it only got worse from there - which suggested the original position was the optimal one.So that's the story for me.  Not only did they not improve reach, but they actually made it worse.  I'm not saying all of the other folks are wrong, I'm just saying your mileage may vary.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24KDFE6YTYEDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMJI9TA#wasThisHelpful","R24KDFE6YTYEDX","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a low end low priced softbox which works just fine.  I've used it for a few headshots and the light is quite nice.  If I had it to do over again, I'd probably pay a few bucks more and get a different softbox.The reason for this is that once the softbox is set up, you cannot access your flash.  For flash units which require you to make an adjustment on the flash itself (instead of remotely from your camera), you literally have no access without peeling back the diffusion layer and grid.  If you only have to make a single adjustment, this isn't too tedious, but for constant adjusting, this is an absolute dealbreaker for this product.Bottom line for me... for flashes that you can adjust remotely, this is a 5/5 product.  For flashes you need to continually access for adjustments, it's a 3/5 product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW2SUWGK8LL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00908A8PK#wasThisHelpful","RIW2SUWGK8LL7","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought two jugs of the 2lb peanut butter chocolate flavor about a month ago.  Now having gone through one of the two pound jugs I feel like I'm ready to give a review on the protein.First of all, the bad.  Taste. I feel like MuscleTech went way over the top with the artificial flavors and sweeteners with this protein.  The protein has a very intense artificially sweet taste to it.  If the sweetness is a ""10"", I feel like something around a 6 would have been ideal.  If you have the option, I would recommend mixing the product with milk instead of water.  This will blunt the sweetness a bit and give the shake more substance.  Granted, I've only tried one of the flavors, but I suspect the intensity of the sweetness is similar with all of the flavors.However... with that in mind, this seems to be a great functional protein.  Shakes are thick and keep me satisfied far longer than regular whey protein.  The difference was noticeable from the very first time I used it.  So in that regard, I do really like this protein.In the end though, most high quality proteins are more or less equally effective.  It's not magic and one brand is not going to make drastic changes in your physique regardless of what any company's marketing department tells you.  For the price, I feel like there are equally good proteins (or better) on the market with a much less offensive taste.3.5/5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFRKT1LD67O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZMQ2ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1TFRKT1LD67O0","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put this reel in my garage so i could unwind hose and wash my car just outside the garage.

"Products like this are really a compromise.  No one likes large, bulky cases, but these protect the best.  On the other hand, no one likes to have their phone damaged when they drop it.  Unfortunately the best looking cases offer practically no drop protection.This case walks the line between protection and looks very well, IMO.There is just barely enough cushion to protect from a 3-4 foot drop, while still being slim enough to be attractive.  The case provides a little ""grip"" while not being overly sticky as to attract dust and dirt.This case fits the HTC one exceptionally well.  It slides over the phone firmly and snaps into place.  There is a significant lip on the front of the phone case to protect from falls on a flat surface.  On the back there are circular holes to allow for all of the microphone and camera hardware to do its job.  On the top and bottom though, the cutouts for the headphone jack and USB cable are larger than they really need to be.  I'm not sure if there is a technical reason for this, but it's something that caught my eye.Three weeks into owning the case I have had no issues with dust or debris getting in between the case and the phone - despite spending a lot of time in my pockets.  I also have had no issues with my phone overheating despite the very powerful hardware that the HTC one has.Overall I'm very happy with this case, and can fully recommend it to others looking for a slim case for the One.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCLKPIKKODFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMCYYL6#wasThisHelpful","RQCLKPIKKODFJ","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me just get the negative out of the way up from.  This is not the easiest tire shine to apply. What you'll get is a small foam applicator with a ridge cut down the center.  You'll squeeze some product into the ridge then wipe your tire with it.  The problem is that most tires are not smooth and you'll have to ""work"" the applicator on the surface of the tire to get down into all of the grooves and print on the side of the tire.  This is not the easiest thing to do, and to be honest, a spray-on tire shine is a LOT easier.  You also have the issue of the foam applicator tearing if you apply too much pressure to it over rough tires.Regardless... you will great a great, long lasting shine with this product.  I've made my way though half a bottle over the past 8 months (which takes a lot of applications) and am happy with the results.A few tips about this product.  Apply it to a DRY tire and let it sit for a while before driving your vehicle.  Letting it absorb into the rubber a bit seems to help with keeping it on the tire and off the side of your car.  Likewise, resist the temptation to put too much product on the tire.  Just a little bit will do.  Any more than that and it will just sling off the tire onto your fender whens you drive.Overall a great product, I just wish it came with more than one applicator because I'm not sure if the one included will last the entire bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SY2TNFNHZCRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FOJSHW#wasThisHelpful","R2SY2TNFNHZCRA","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a 2006 Acura TL with the optional Brembo braking package.  The pads for these brakes dust like crazy, so I decided to give this product a try on my wheels to see if I could help keep them clean a little longer than normal.I followed the instructions and waited for my wheels to dry before I sprayed the product on the wheels.  It went on easily, dried clear, and all seemed good.  That is, until the brake dust came.  What actually happened is that I didn't get the spray 100% uniform and there were some blotches on the wheel which did not receive proper coverage.  What I wound up with was a wheel with ugly blotches of brake dust where there was insufficient product coverage.  It looks very odd.There is also the issue of the ""haze"" building up on the wheel, though to be fair I only noticed this after a rainstorm.  The rain might or might not have contributed to the haze, so I'm not sure about that.So this product does actually work, you just need to be very meticulous with application.  Also, some wheel finishes might be prone to the haze issue more than others.  I used the product on silver, painted wheels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYHU99YFQZYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002APN2VC#wasThisHelpful","R2GYHU99YFQZYX","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used so many lip balms that I have lost count.  Lip Medex is, by far, the best one at healing and soothing chapped, damaged lips.  It has a strong medicated, menthol smell which is not the most becoming, but it tells you that this stuff means business.  When you first put it on, it goes on with a cooling sensation and makes you feel better almost immediately.  I usually apply it every 4 hours or so during the day.  After about a day or two my lips are almost always completely better.I always keep a tube of this stuff in the cabinet because when you need it, you really need it.

It feels a little like those ""volume"" shampoos (which make your hair a little sticky), only without the increase in volume.  Also, they could have left out the blue coloring from this shampoo and been all the better.

"Before I start, some background on me.  I'm a 30 year old male who has been into weightlifting and ""fitness"" since about 13.  I was born and grew up in the south and was raised on some of the unhealthiest foods you can imagine.  Think about all of the obesity causing ""southern soul food"" and you'll get the idea.  I ate few vegetables growing up and through college.  Since then I've tried to clean up my diet with moderate success, though through the years there has been one staple which has not wavered - meat, dairy, and eggs.  In other words, lots of animal protein and animal fat. I was taught these food products were necessary for anyone who wanted to be a successful athlete.  I never really worried about the long term ramifications because I was ""healthy"" (to the eye anyway), I was young, and many other people ate the same way I did and were doing fine.My dad had a mild heart attack 7 years ago at age 56 and to be honest, I want desperately not to follow the same path as him as I age.  Issues of diet and how it relates to chronic, debilitating disease are something I carry a lot of interest in.  With that context in mind, I went into this book with an open mind, hoping to learn something.Dr Esselstyn outlines in this book his decades of experience in the medical community learning how to treat and prevent heart disease.  By using a low fat vegan diet he has successfully arrested and reversed heart disease in every one of the patients which have come to him for help.  That one point is worth re-iterating.  His success rate has been right at 100% with this diet.  People who have been turned away from surgeons because their disease was too severe for mechanical intervention and they had ""no hope left"" have been successfully treated with these diet protocols.  The logical framework he lays out in this book is extremely compelling and the evidence for it's success cannot be ignored by any rational person.After reading ""The China Study"", and this book, I decided to make some changes in my diet.  Given the heavy bias towards animal products in my diet, this would have to be a shift and a transition, not an overnight change, but I am getting there.  Four weeks in I have:- Completely eliminated egg yolks from my breakfast (previously I hate between 3-5 whole eggs per day for many years).- Removed about 90% of the dairy from my diet.  I still use a small amount of low fat cheese - primary for flavoring.- Completely eliminated red meat and all forms of fatty meat from my diet.  All of it.- Reduced my lean meat consumption (primarily chicken breast) by about 70%So after taking all of that stuff out of my diet, what have I replaced it with?  Vegetable and whole great products.  I try to use high protein grains and lentils to  support the dietary needs of my strength training.The results so far have been dramatic.  My energy and stamina are way up in the gym.  I'm able to workout significantly longer without fatigue.  I can run farther, more often, with less fatigue than I used to.  I have also noted improved sexual function and speech fluency.  I've struggled with a mild speech impediment since I was young and it's been a hindrance in almost every part of my life.  I am cautiously optimistic here, but I have noticed a significant improvement (I'd say 60%) in this condition over the past couple weeks.  This has been an absolute godsend for me and if the improvement holds I will never (ever) go back to eating the way I used to again.What are the drawbacks?  Well I'm concerned about the amount of high quality protein in my diet and how it relates to muscle recovery and strength development.  So far I have not noticed any significant reductions in strength or muscle mass, but it's still too early to tell.  I am losing a little weight (down from 184 to 180) even though I'm not trying to.  I think this is more due to a lack of calories than anything.  I'm confident though I'll be able to adjust my diet to compensate in the future as I get better at this.My recommendation to anyone reading this review would be to give the book a read.  You have absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain.  Even if you don't have heart disease, you can vastly improve your health and longevity with the dietary guidelines promoted by this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120YU1QB7JYFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583333002#wasThisHelpful","R120YU1QB7JYFG","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll let the cat right out of the bag.  The aim of this book is to open your eyes to the health dangers of animal based food products and to extol the virtues of a whole foods, plant based (vegan) diet.  Before you roll your eyes and groan, hear me out.The author of this book, Dr. Colin Campbell does an excellent job of outlining some of the very real health dangers associated with meats and animal proteins.  In particular, the link of these foods to certain types of cancer (colon, breast, prostate, and a few others) is very compelling.  Further more, the link of dairy products in children to type 1 diabetes is absolutely staggering.  In fact, this link is stronger than the link of smoking to lung cancer is.  Smoking increases your risk of lung cancer 10 fold.  Infants consuming cows milk based products increases their risk of type 1 diabetes by 13 fold.  In addition, he cites several studies linking casein (the predominant protein in dairy) as being highly cancer promoting.  The gist is that casein itself does not cause cancer, but it promotes the growth and spread of it rapidly and that by abstaining from this protein you can effectively halt the spread of certain cancers.Those are a couple of the highlights from the first half of of the book.  As someone who is very concerned with diet and health, it was absolutely enthralling and enlightening.Why haven't you heard of any of these things before?  Well, the meat and dairy lobby stand to lose billions of dollars by having their products vilified by official health organizations.  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an yearly basis to ensure that these products receive positive scientific press and the federal nutrition recommendations do not discourage the consumption of these products.  They will even go so far as to blackmail and strong arm respectable scientists to achieve their goals.  Make no mistake about it. Industry cares far more about their profits than they do your health.  This book outlines and clarifies this with great detail and does an excellent job doing so.So why give this book four stars instead of five?  Well, the center portion of the book is the weakest for me. This is the part where Dr Campbell goes through and lists the effects of animal based foods to various illnesses that plague western society - including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and eye/brain disorders.  He is obviously a very intelligent man and he makes some excellent points, but while he spends 360 pages vilifying animal foods, he spends approximately 2 pages (I am not exaggerating) talking about the dangers of refined starches, sugars, and carbohydrates.How someone could write two significant chapters of such an important book as this and not mention the link of elevated insulin levels to both diabetes and heart disease is absolutely stunning.  In fact, this one omission is so damning that it really challenges the premise of the entire book for me.  The issue I see is that Dr. Campbell is so intent on vilifying animal products that he has not stopped to consider the very serious dangers of refined plant products.The title of this book comes from a huge study of nutrition and health done in China back in the early 80s.  It basically correlates certain types of modern diseases with dietary patterns in China.  People who live in the more poor, rural parts of China eat a mostly plant based diet and have few of the ""modern"" diseases talked about in this book.  Once these same people move into more urban parts of China and their diets change to that of a more ""western"" style of eating, they adopt many of these chronic illnesses.  The correlation is very compelling, however it is not the whole story.There are zero doubts in my mind that a whole foods plant based diet is more healthy than a traditional western diet.  People who eat a whole foods, plant based diet are not eating animal products, but you know what else they aren't eating?  Soda, fruit juices, sugars, candy, crackers, bread, pastries, etc.  All of these things have been proven to be strong promoters of heart disease, diabetes, and a number of other western illnesses.  Despite these facts, the condemnation of these products takes up literally 2 pages of this 365 page book.  WOW.Now before you think I'm trashing this book too hard, let me be clear.  This is an excellent book and absolutely worth buying and reading by anyone concerned with their health.  Just understand that while this book is not the last word in nutrition, it's a very good start.  Dr. Campbell is obviously an extremely intelligent and accomplished researcher.  The points he makes on the dangers of animal foods are very compelling - so much so that it has prompted me to make some changes in my own diet.  I will be reducing my consumption of meats and dairy (I've already stopped eating whole eggs) and filling the void in my diet with vegetables.  After two weeks of this, I already feel better and more energetic.  You owe it to yourself to add this book to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJVAZ23PYH6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932100660#wasThisHelpful","R3RJVAZ23PYH6P","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have a couple other Arkon mounts (one for each car) for my Samsung Infuse smartphone. Through a series of trial and error attempts, I have found that I prefer a traditional GPS many times while in the car.  Unfortunately my aging Tom Tom car mount has far outliving its usefulness.  Anyone who owns the OEM Tom Tom car mount knows how marginally impressive they are.This replacement by Arkon is worlds better.  The ""Flip to lock"" has a much more positive action and much more secure than the questionable ""twist to lock"" system used by Tom Tom.  To frustrated Tom Tom users, this is the mount you're looking for, trust me.One bonus to using the Arkon system is that if you own multiple types of mounts (one for a smart phone, one for a Tom Tom), you can interchange the front mounts.  That way I can leave the suction base-mount attached to my dash, and just change the front mounting carriage depending on what GPS I feel like using that day.

"Amazon is really bad about giving the full nutritional facts on products like this, so here goes:2.2lb Container:1 serving: 1 scoop (37g)Servings per container: 26Calories: 120Total Fat: 1gTotal Carb: 15gFiber: 4gSugar: 8gProtein: 15g(tons of vitamins and minerals, many in much larger than 100% doses)(large amounts of greens/fruits/enzyme blends)This powder is different than most on the market because it's not really a ""protein"" powder, it's more of a meal replacement powder.  The flavor is vanilla, but it doesn't taste like vanilla at all.  It has a deep fruity/organic taste and mixes very thick with water.  8oz per scoop is recommended, but I would actually suggest closer to 12 or 16 if you are mixing this by hand or with a shaker bottle.  It mixes very thick and you will have a hard time assimilating one scoop of powder into 8oz of water by shaking.  Blending should work fine regardless of how much water you use though.Taste is pretty non-offensive.  It's not great, but not terrible either.  It's actually better than I thought it would be given the high percentage of soy protein (which generally tastes bad).

"These are great minimalist weight lifting gloves for those who don't need a heavy wrist wrap.  The velcro strap stops at the base of the wrist and gives practically no support to the wrist.  There is a moderate amount of padding on the palms and fingers in just the right places.  The fingers on these gloves are designed to come up to the middle knuckle on your hand.  This is enough protection for the parts of your hand which are the most highly stressed by weight lifting - notably on the inside of your hand at the base of the fingers.  The gloves seem very durable and are very grippy.  All good things.So basically I give this glove 5 stars for design and construction.However, I also deduct a star for the absolutely wonky sizing.  I'm a 5'8"" male with moderately sized hands.  I bought a large and they are too small. I just don't understand how a male of below average height and average proportions can require an extra large sized glove.  I thought maybe the glove just needed breaking in, but I can confirm that it does not.  After two workouts the glove is still too small and doesn't appear to want to stretch out.  I've been working out for 17 years and this is the first time I've required an extra large size workout glove.  I guess next time I'll know better.My hand is 7-1/2"" from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my hand.  I would say that the maximum size for a comfortable ""large"" fit would be 7"".  Anything over 7"" would require an extra large.

"ZMA is a pretty standardized product.  So long as you buy from a reputable company you don't have a whole lot of guesswork involved with the purchasing.For those of you who aren't familiar with ZMA, it's a mineral supplement which provides zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B-6 in a very specific ratio to optimize absorption.  Intensely training athletes tend to be deficient in one or more of these nutrients, which in turn inhibits proper anabolic hormone production.  If you work out hard and your diet perhaps isn't the best, it's a good chance you will benefit from ZMA.  You will fall asleep quicker, sleep deeper, and wake up feeling a little more refreshed than you would without it.  All other things being equal, this will help you recover faster and grow stronger from your workouts.  The effect is not dramatic, but it's generally worth the price of the supplement for most people.I've been using this brand of ZMA for a couple weeks now and it's worked just as well as other brands in the past.

"I've been using Taiyo Yuden/JVC Watershield disks for the past year or so.  After going through 50 disks I was generally very happy with them, but wanted to evaluate my options before I bought another spindle of disks.  For me, 50 disks is about 3/4 of a year's worth for me.  I use these disks to burn digital images to for client delivery.  They need to look good and hold up well over time.  Given the importance of this product for me, it just makes no sense to pinch pennies here.  I wanted the best.After doing a little research, it seemed like these disks might be a bit better so I decided to give them a try.  So far I have been very pleased with the decision.I print these disks up on my Epson Artisan 730 printer using genuine Epson inks.  What I have found is that the tonality, color richness, and color fidelity with these disks is absolutely spot on.  It really took me by surprise how much better these looked to my eyes than the JVC Watershield disks.  The JVC disks seemed to have trouble with very dark and very bright tones, leaving me with an image which seemed to lack the tonal range that it should.  Also, while the colors were good they were a bit different than what I was getting with my calibrated monitor.These verbatim disks have delivered color which is absolutely spot on compared to my monitor.  I could not be more happy with them.  Furthermore, the sharpness and clarity I'm getting from the disks is right there on par with a high quality glossy print.  Color richness and gloss is exceptional.If there is one nit to pick, I would say that if you look very closely (closer than any client will look) you can see a slight graininess or lack of resolution to the printed image on the disk.  This seems to be more of a printer issue than a disk issue though.  This effect is extremely slight and in reality might be worth a 1/4 star deduction.I can easily give my full recommendation to these disks.  They are easily the best I've found with regards to image quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INZPML0WNB2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GR1C3A#wasThisHelpful","R3INZPML0WNB2D","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using wireless triggers for the past 7 years or so.  The technology has grown my leaps and bounds since then, and to be honest, it's extremely impressive where things are toay.  These YN622s are the pinnacle of affordable ETTL triggers, right now.As a brief overview, these triggers will transmit an ETTL signal from your camera's hot shoe to a remotely mounted flash.  This will allow automatic flash control of remote flashes.  Anyone who shoots events and frequently changes camera settings, changes lenses, or subject angles, will greatly benefit from this.  Instead of having to go back to your flashes and manually change the power settings, the flash does this automatically as if it were sitting atop your camera.The big deal with these triggers is that the technology is now affordable - and it works well.  Radiopoppers are an option, but they are either expensive (Px system) or notoriously unreliable (Jrx system).  Pocketwizards are also an option, but are also pricey and have range/RF interference issues.  This is very new, very advanced trigger technology and the kinks are still getting ironed out.  I think Yongnuo might have finally cracked the code.The users manual for these triggers is quite long (28 pages) and intimidating.  Being automatic triggers, they have a myriad of options that most users are not going to be used to.  It doesn't helps that the manual was written by a non-English speaker, but that's another issue.After playing with these triggers for a while, here are the highlights for me.- Seamless ETTL transmittal.  Turn on the triggers, mount your flahses, set the channels, and start firing.  If you don't want to learn all of the advanced features in the manual you don't have to.  You can basically just turn the triggers on and they immediately work.  Plain and Simple.- Transceiver design.  These units can function as both a transmitter and receiver.  This is nice because you don't need two different units to perform two different jobs.  4 units can function as 4 receivers only, 4 transmitters only, or any combination in between.- Mount your flash on top of the Trigger.  No more unreliable cable connections to the flash (Radiopopper Jrx).  This is a solid, robust design with a good, firm electrical connection.  When the trigger is on-camera it will allow pass-through ETTL to the flash sitting on top of your camera.  This way you can use ETTL with an on-camera flash as well as ETTL with remote flashes as well.- Robust design.  From the first couple weeks of usage, I am cautiously optimistic about the build quality of these units. If you are carrying an on-camera flash on top of these triggers, then the flash acts a large moment arm on the trigger.  This has been known to fracture the base of the trigger - rendering it almost useless.  Any slop in the bottom or top mounting connections only amplifies this stress, increasing the chance of failure.  So far these triggers seem very solid and there is no slop at all.  I am confident in the build quality, though I would still be careful with them when using them on-camera.- Built-in IR focus assist.  When you aren't using a speedlite on-camera, these units can use their built in infrared assist beam to help with focusing in low light.  This is a huge benefit for dimly lit environments.  This feature is unique and to be honest I haven't seen it on any other trigger design like this.- Group Settings.  With the groups you can lock in the ratio of firing power to specified ratios.  This can be done in-camera for recent cameras which allow remote speedlite adjustment through the camera's menu (5DII and newer, generally).Drawbacks?- Complication.  28 page long user manual for a set of flash triggers should tell you something.  My strong recommendation would be to read the manual carefully and test the triggers out at home before taking these to a paid job.  Odds are you are NOT going to be able to figure these things out in the 5 minutes before your photo session.- Menu driven controls.  These triggers have a LOT of different options and functions, but relatively few buttons.  This means that to access many of it's features, you are going to have the use the camera's built-in flash control menu.  It's one of the drawbacks of having such advanced triggers, but a worthwhile tradeoff for many people.  Count on a little more involved setup procedure for these triggers relative to the earlier models.- Because of the transceiver design, you will need to buy some sort of mounting shoe for remote flash units.  There is no 1/4-20 thread on the bottom of these units like there is with other ""receiver only"" designs.  The little plastic feet that come with most flashes generally have a thread mount on the bottom, so for now I am using these.- You need newer cameras and flashes to take advantage of all of the features these triggers have to offer.  You can use them with older equipment, though many of the features are lost.  Check the compatibility list for more details.In summary, these are well-sorted, advanced ETTL flash triggers for a very attractive price.  Yongnuo seems to have learned from the  mistakes of other companies here and produced a trigger with no glaring flaws.  The fact that they did all of this and kept the price as low as they did is just amazing to me. I would highly recommend these for a flash power user.  For a beginner or anyone with more basic needs, a simple manual trigger is probably a better option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXAUA3NKCSHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EJSWJE#wasThisHelpful","R1NXAUA3NKCSHQ","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a Samsung Infuse smartphone and like many other smart phones you cannot use it in the car for GPS purposes without draining the battery.  Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.  So long as I am not doing anything intensive with the phone in the car, it charges my phone very rapidly with no problems what so ever.  Just be aware of the above caveats and you should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRP22IFREJDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S5Q9CA#wasThisHelpful","R2FRP22IFREJDS","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those songs that you probably like but are probably embarrassed to tell your friends that you like.  It's ok, I was like that but eventually came around.  Even after hearing the song almost constantly for 4 straight months on the radio, I'm still not quite tired of it (yet).It's definitely a frilly pop song without a whole lot of substance, but it's light listening when you're in the mood for upbeat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAKG7ZO8IOHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BZM3HK#wasThisHelpful","R2AAKG7ZO8IOHJ","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you were expecting some super stimulant that doubles your blood pressure and leaves you tearing through the gym like a rabid maniac, you'll probably be disappointed by this product.  Truthfully there are MANY other pre-workout stimulants on the market stronger than this.  As far as I am concerned, that niche is filled.Instead, where this product steps in is for people who want a kick for their workout, but still want to be able to sleep at night.  For me, such a pre-workout would be worth its weight in gold.  After about a week of usage, I like this stuff a LOT.  I stack it with creatine ethyl ester and the amount of energy, focus, and stamina I have in the gym is as good as I can remember on ANY pre-workout supplement.  I don't say this lightly either, I have tried many of them.The sensation I get from this product is one of heightened focus, drive, and strength but without the jitters, crash, or trouble sleeping I get from traditional pre-workout products.  I go to the gym after work (from 5:00 to 6:00), so it's very important that I am able to get to sleep approximately four hours after I leave the gym.  With Hyper FX I can do that, with many other PWO products, I cant.I'm 5'8"", 185lbs and about 3/4 of a scoop (a dose is one scoop) is all it takes to kick me in high gear.  The product works by dissolving in an effervescent fizz (it is recommended that you NOT shake this product), and takes effect very quickly.  I'd say 20 minutes after consumption, you are ready to go.  Unlike many pure stimulants, the effect is relatively short lived.  After about 3 hours or so, you are back to feeling mostly normal and shouldn't have much problem falling asleep at night.  Keep in mind there is some caffeine in here, so the stimulants effect is still present to some extent.  However it is much milder than you get from other similar products.So for those of you who train late in the day or are more sensitive to stimulants, this product is worth serious consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMX13CXHF5K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0075JTJ42#wasThisHelpful","R3GMX13CXHF5K6","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a Think Tank Pro Speedbelt with two of these pouches.  I just didn't want to make the jump to the ""35"" size pouch, though I could probably use it.  This pouch is going to handle lenses no more than 7"" long and about 3.5"" in diameter (measure your lenses before buying!).Here are the lenses I own and how they fit into these pouches:Canon 16-35/2.8 II - Fits ok without the hood, VERY tight with the hood.Canon 24/1.4L - Fits wellCanon 50/1.2L - Fits wellCanon 85/1.2L - Fits ok without the hood, VERY tight with the hoodCanon 135/2L - Fits without the hood, does not fit with the hood.Canon 100/2.8 - Fits without the hood, does not fit with the hood.Like all Thinktank products, it is built exceptionally well and is lightweight.  The drawcord at the top keeps the pouch shut do you don't have to worry about your lenses falling out when you travel.  It also comes with a rain pouch.  So this is an excellent, padded bag for those who use the Thinktank belt system.  If you use larger lenses or lenses with larger hoods, I definitely recommend the Lens changer 35.  This ""25"" is really only for smaller lenses.  .","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5BCYM2G0H10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MQ1MC6#wasThisHelpful","R2V5BCYM2G0H10","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as dog bags go, these are some of the more affordable you can buy.  They are also at least partially bio degradable which is a plus.  Unfortunately they do not come in the little 2-1/2"" wide rolls we are so often used to when it comes to dog bags.  Instead these bags come on a single 8"" long roll that you will have to tear off one by one and use.  This is a mild inconvenience if you have one of those dog bag carriers on your dog leash that is made for the smaller rolls.That is a nit pick.  Another nit pick is that the bags are a little hard to get open, which is typical of most cheaper bags.  So if you are looking for affordable bags and don't mind all 200 coming on one giant roll, this is a good way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RIN64TVYBLXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GQRSGO#wasThisHelpful","R2RIN64TVYBLXF","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have a particularly large desk.  Unfortunately for me and my desk, the size of my keyboards have done nothing but get larger over the years - both in thickness and in desk area consumed.  When my gigantic Logitech Wave keyboard finally bit the dust I had decided enough was enough.  I wanted something smaller and thinner.This keyboard is 17"" wide, 6"" deep, and .6"" at its thickest (.3"" at its thinnest - it is sloped).  In terms of sheer volume, this keyboard is about 70% smaller than my previous keyboard, yet provides all of the typing space I need and nearly all of the buttons I could want.  There is no handrest, but since the keyboard is only .3"" thick where you put your hands, you don't really need one.The keys on this keyboard are the flat ""chiclet"" style keys that feel like those on a high end laptop.  However unlike a high end laptop, this keyboard is the most rigid typing surface I've ever felt.  It literally feels like there is a solid slab of marble on the other side of the keys.  There is absolutely zero flex in this board.  To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about this.  I think I'm going to have to learn to type a little bit softer.  Also another thing to note is since the keys are flat, there will likely be a learning curve if you are used to curved keys like I was.  Regardless, I am typing very quickly on this keyboard.Wireless setup was a snap.  I needed no drivers on Windows 7 64 bit.  I just plugged in the receiver, hit the connect button on the back of the keyboard and I was in business.  There are standard function keys (F1-F12), a full size number pad, and volume controls.  You can also access media player controls by hitting the ""Fn"" key along with the corresponding function key at the top.I would describe this product as a high end minimalist keyboard for those looking for a nice keyboard with a minimal footprint.  Both function and aesthetics are top notch with this piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UEVRMBS7NFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HNHRA6#wasThisHelpful","R5UEVRMBS7NFC","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm kind of surprised at the two star reviews here.  You're buying a ten dollar (as of August 2012) flash drive.  You can't expect world beating performance for this price level.  Instead what you're getting is a functional, reliable (so far) flash drive, with a couple nifty features.Functionally, the slide out connector is a nice feature.  It keeps the end from getting as dirty or damaged as it would were it constantly exposed.  One nit pick though is that I have found the button (for the slider) to be a little picky about how you push it.  Sometimes you have to be a bit deliberate with pushing it down or else it won't slide.  Not a ton of refinement here, but it works.As far as performance goes, I'm getting about 3.7 MB/s write and about 8 MB/s read speed from this unit.  Not great, but sufficient given the price.Overall this is a nice low end flash drive if you don't demand top shelf performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OE53VSI3RNUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YX9O9O#wasThisHelpful","R1OE53VSI3RNUN","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this little vac for the past 6 year or so to clean my car and to vacuum out various areas of my apartment.  It's been a trooper and overall I've been very happy with it.  The suction power is excellent for its size and I've found it more than adequate for vacuuming automotive carpet and for various household tasks.  The attachments make it especially useful for different surfaces as well.Overall this vac is both small and light, which can be good and bad.  One downside to the light weight is that it tips over easily.  There is some sort of valve inside the vacuum that if it gets tipped over, the valve will shut, preventing suction.  This makes the unit sound like it's going to explode.  So you basically want to make sure the vacuum stays upright and does not tip over while you're using it.  The light weight of the unit makes this a challenge at times.As for the filter inside the vacuum, I have never replaced the filter and never really needed to.  So long as you don't get the filter wet, you should be able to clean it with an air compressor fairly easily to maintain longevity.For household usage, this is just about the perfect mini-vac.  It's powerful, durable, and cheap.  I just wish it didn't tip over so easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZTQJSNH6D8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001FFM3O#wasThisHelpful","R3OZTQJSNH6D8V","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spend about 8-12 hours a day on the computer and after years of usage, I started to get pretty serious carpel tunnel on my right hand.  Switching to using a mouse with my left hand helped circumvent the pain, but it still did not address the problem.  For my work I need the precision afforded by using my dominant hand.At first I thought the pain was coming from specifically using a mouse, but it turns out it was the rotation of the forearm that was causing the pain while I work.  The vertical design of this mouse prevents that and helps the arm work in a more natural position.After about a month of using this mouse most of the pain in my hand is gone.  I can use my right hand for mousing all day and only experience a small fraction of the discomfort I used to.So why five stars if it only ""mostly"" reduced the pain?  Well, to be honest I feel like it's my fault for not switching to an ergonomic mouse sooner.  If you wait until you already have pain, then it's too late to catch the problem at an optimal time.  So while the mouse design is excellent (close to ideal even), if your hand is already in pain, you're probably not going to be able to use ANY mouse with complete comfort.  Don't wait until you already have pain to do something about over use problems with a normal mouse.Overall an excellent product.  I just wish I had found it a couple years back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7E1GWIC7TZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00427TAIK#wasThisHelpful","R3A7E1GWIC7TZ5","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this printer after two of the print heads on my artisan 710 permanently clogged and couldn't be fixed.  I expected this printer to be similar to the 710 and I was right.  In fact it's about 95% identical, with only moderate changes in a few key places.- The 730 has a new touch sensitive front panel display vs the button based panel of the 710.- The 730 has a new color scheme (dark blue vs solid black of the 710)- The 730 has firmware which is automatically updateable though software.- The 730 costs nearly half as much as the 710 ($98 vs $180)- The 730 does NOT take third party ink cartridges as well as the 710.Pay close attention to that last point.  If you are considering using this printer for high volume work with third party ink cartridges, I would consider a different printer.  Apparently the recent firmware updates by Epson don't like non-genuine ink cartridges.Ok so that's what is different from the Artisan 710.  What's the same as the 710?- Outstanding printing and scanning quality.- Same great print speed and print features (auto duplexing).- Built in CD/DVD printing with excellent quality- Very stable and reliable wireless performance (for printing and scanning)- Same flimsy paper tray- Same inconvenient paper loading- Same expensive ink cartridgesSo yes, the Artisan 730 has some of the same quirks the old 710 has, but it keeps enough of the good features to make it worth buying.  Overall I'm very happy.UPDATE (9/17/12):The printer apparently died over the weekend.  It will turn on for five seconds, do a partial pre-operation check, then freeze and shut off.  Espon support was completely stumped and is sending me a new printer.  Very disappointed in the lack of quality control here, but props to Epson for taking care of the problem.

"I actually bought this tablet to help with carpel tunnel pain in my right hand due to spending 10-12 hours a day on the computer.  Turns out using a tablet like this is just as stressful - if not more so - than using a normal mouse.  I fully realize this is not the primary objective of a tablet, but it's food for thought.  Turns out most of the pain was coming from the twisting of the forearm and working with the hands horizontally instead of vertically in a ""handshake"" position.  Tablets obviously don't improve on this, so my pain hasn't improved, sadly.I've never used a tablet before and will confess there was a steep learning curve for getting the coordination down with it.  There is plenty of space on the tablet for general usage (much larger and you find yourself moving your hand around a lot).  Wacom's software is very good and there are plenty of options for customization of the buttons and inputs.  I found the responsiveness of the tablet very good with the stylus and mediocre with the ""touch"" finger-based input.  For some reason I found myself having to repeatedly click on certain things to get them to select.  Though I'm sure this would improve with time, I definitely found myself being much slower than this than I would be a mouse.So coming from a complete tablet newbie, I will confess that the usage of this device didn't meet my expectations, though that is probably more of an issue my expectations than the tablet itself. My recommendation would be to use this for stylus input and leave everything else to a standard mouse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z280A1BW92Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HGBEZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2Z280A1BW92Y0","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I drive a 2000 Celica GTS and decided to drop this filter in to replace an old paper filter.  Honestly, I did not expect a whole lot, but I figured it would be the last filter I ever put in the car and it might get me slightly better gas mileage on the highway.Well so far the gas mileage has panned out.  I have gained 1-1.5MPG on the highway.  As for power gain, there might be a little, though I don't push the engine hard enough to really notice.  I have no interest in redlining a 12 year old, 200,000 mile engine, so that theory will probably never be tested.  It's a safe bet though that if there are any power gains to be had, it's very high in the powerband.  Expect little to no low end torque improvement with this (as any) air filter.As an odd note, I have noticed that the throttle response of my car is now a little more sensitive.  This may or may not be preferably, depending on how you drive.  For commuter cars or family vehicles, this sensitivity would probably annoy most.  However for those who drive sporty cars in a semi-aggressive manner, the extra throttle sensitivity is probably welcomed.  For my tired daily driver, I honestly preferred the throttle response from the paper filter more.That said, so long as you understand the benefits of such a filter, it's a great purchase for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2O6AKAG0I81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00062ZMAK#wasThisHelpful","R3O2O6AKAG0I81","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For starters, this isn't your run of the mill whey protein powder.  This powder consists of protein, cocoa, natural sweeteners, and that's about it.  This is ideal for people wanting a completely natural protein and are steering clear of artificial sweeteners (sucralose and similar compounds).One result of the lack of artificial sweeteners is that this protein won't taste like chocolate brownie a-la mode.  I can best describe the taste as being ""weak"" and ""unoffensive"".  It's not very thick, so I would advise using less liquid as opposed to more when mixing.  And as always, this formula tastes better with milk than with water.There is one primary competing product this this one made by Optimum - which I had bought previously.  The only real difference between the Optimum Natural Whey and this Met-Rx formulation is the lack of protein enzymes to aid in digestion.  Everything else seems identical.

"This battery makes a good replacement for anything which takes a BP-511 or BP-511A Canon battery.  It charges up flawlessly in the Canon charger, holds a charge nicely, and lasts a long time.Older BP-511s tend to charge up fine, but lose their charge very rapidly.  I've got a couple that won't even last more than 50 shots in a Canon 20D.  These fresh replacements are good for about 10 times that number of shots, AND the charge lasts if you let them sit. Older batteries tend to run dead if you let them sit for a while.And for the price, you could buy 5 of them and still come out cheaper than a single Canon BP-511A.

"My review probably won't be relevant to most reading this review, but hopefully useful to some.  I am a photographer and I bought this backdrop to use for a photobooth.  So far, it has been a very ideal solution, made even better by the surprisingly low price.Genuine, branded photobooth backdrops typically run 3-4 times this amount for what is basically just a fancy curtain.  This works just as well, looks fantastic, and only costs a fraction as much.The fabric in this curtain feels like a very smooth, heavyweight, high thread count bed-sheet.  It emits a very gentle sheen which looks fantastic against modest, indoor lighting.  The top grommets are perfectly functional and look great when you alternate them through your hanging rod.The fabric does have a tendency of becoming wrinkled if you leave it sitting folded up (like I do).  You can remedy this by putting it into the dryer with a wet rag or small towel.  Once it's out, immediately hang it up and the wrinkles should be gone by the time it cools.  This effectively ""steams"" the curtain without the need for a steamer.So whether used for photography, or as an actual curtain in your house, this is a great product that I'm very happy with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AIL2JD6PXB3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AKEKKC#wasThisHelpful","R1AIL2JD6PXB3U","A2NSMJVQY0RV9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NSMJVQY0RV9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, I did NOT buy this product of Amazon but another household staple. I made sure I document my statements with pictures, as some other reviewers have been attacked for bad reviews.So, let me start with the all over sturdyness, well it is not there, please see picture sturdy. When you press the release button you have to press real hard to release the latch, plus the box bends :-)  very good sign for a safe box. But see pic please and decide yourself.2nd problem, a small one tough, the Steelmaster product label came of before I even used the box.......see picture.3rd problem, as others stated, the person who designed the slots for the bills used templates for some currency, but not USD, because the bills do NOT fill the slot. I mean how on earth.....but ok.4th and 5fth problem: the opening mechanism is placed right on top of paper money slot 2 and 3. Ergo, many times money gets stuck under the mechanism. I ripper a 5er and a 10 at first AND last day of usage.Others stated the handle broke of, mine didn't, but I did not give it a chance to happen.Bad product, cheaply made for a product in that price category.

"Who needs 27 ounces of Maggi? You can't cook? Maggi will at least make it taste. The wife can't cook. Smack Maggi on top and it will taste.Soup is lame, 2 drops and you have a great taste.

"Well, I am not impressed, here is why. I use the PH meter (or better I planned to) for jams.I have a small business and I sell all kinds of fruit spreads, for food safety issues, I decided it is betterif I can check ph levels and brix at the spot. I used the test material to adjust the readings but here is what happened.So, after I adjusted the readings to be exact, I produced 3 different batches of fruit spread. The readings were 3.8 3.9 and 3.7I had the Jams professionally tested due to local laws I have to have each recipe tested by a laboratory.I was very astonished when I got the results. 3.2  3.1 and 3.4  see, if all readings would have been consistently wrong, fine, I could have calibrated by that.

"Let's be honest here, this is first and foremost NOT pectin but dextrose and therefore a misnomer by default.It also has ascorbic acid added, which is by itself not a problem as it helps the pectin to work. But, real pectin is addedat a rate of 3-5% based on the amount of fruit you use, and allows the reduction of added sugar from 1-1 to down to 1-3 to  1-5 depending on the acidity (low ph) of your fruits. It can be basically used to use zero added sugar, in that case you do need to add ascorbin acid or a similar preservative.Again, the product works, that is not the point, but you pay a load of money for mainly dextrose.....","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMT9PE33CGJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNINOEM#wasThisHelpful","R3TMT9PE33CGJ3","A1QCZQTJNK3MU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCZQTJNK3MU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's be very clear here. All this products call themselves Pectins but are in fact very very low in Pectin.What you buy here is cheap dextrose and some ascorbin acid and maybe 10-15% of pectin.Unfortunately American laws allow this behavior, but thankfully, as clients here on Amazonwe are able to voice said concern. I know real pectin is hard to get, but it is available.You need between 3-5% of pure pectin (measured on ounces of fruit) plus you can bring the added sugars down safely to 20-25%.If you want to go lower then this, you NEED to add ascorbin  acid or another preservative.This is NOT a low calorie option.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB1DLW4VLWF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00024WPSO#wasThisHelpful","RHB1DLW4VLWF7","A1QCZQTJNK3MU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QCZQTJNK3MU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I first bought this ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GLYLUB2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and was very unimpressed, it overheated at the lowest setting, temperature settings were very off. I send it back. Now I bought this and had the situation the other way around. Nothing burned, ever but ...it did not manage to get my jam to a rolling boil at about 120 Celsius 248 Fahrenheit.I tried with a 18 lb batch, 12 lb and 8 lb. It may be ok to heat enough to sear a steak but the all over power output for bigger batches is simply not there. To finish I had to put the pot on my normal stove.Yes it would heat water to 220 to boil but not a sugary solution.

"Im am seriously unimpressed with the cook top. In a former life I was a chef, I am pretty good in the kitchen and know what I am doing.I would think so at least.....well, that is all good and right until I bought this cooktop for low and slow soups and jams.Total disaster, a bean soup with onion and stuff on the lowest setting totally burned in my pot. I mean wth.......on the lowest settings, AFTER I filled in a whole lot of water, the soup burned in brutally.The next problem lies in the way the sensor in this burner works. SOmetimes I ""swing"" pasta or vegetable in butter or sauce. Whenever you lift you pot of the cooker, wait 3 seconds and the things switches off...grrrr....impossible to use for me.....Sorry, I am not even trying to use this setup for jam....right back to Amazon and ready for the next unit from another maker.I am also uploading a pic, so u can see what I mean.....To the person that gave me a not helpful on the review. What else can I do then show and tell you what happened to me?Want me to lie and make up beautiful stories?Not going to happen. I did not like the unit it did not work as intended. It went back.Was it a lemon? Maybe. But even if.

"This is the first book I’ve read by Paul Cleave. I definitely plan to read more. The characters and plot are among the most original I’ve ever read—and the writing itself is fantastic.In TRUST NO ONE, the protagonist is Jerry Grey, a best-selling author of crime fiction. Grey is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. He begins keeping a journal so he’ll be able to reference his thoughts and memories after the disease begins to worsen—but when that finally happens, the disease blurs the lines between Grey’s real life and the fictional characters he created using his alter-ego/pseudonym Henry Cutter … and Grey confesses to being a murderer.At first no one believes him, because the crimes he describes are straight out of his books—but then bodies start turning up on the same days Grey wanders off from his live-in care facility, and the police take notice and begin to treat him as if he really is a murderer.But is he really? Grey, in his rare lucid moments, doesn’t think so. But how can he prove that? He can’t remember what he had for breakfast, let alone what he did when he wandered off …The story alternates brilliantly between third-person and excerpts from Grey’s journal. The pacing is a bit slow for the first half of the book, but the pages are filled with tense, dramatic moments—and the final chapters are pure thriller.TRUST NO ONE is the best mystery/suspense novel I have read in a very long time. I highly recommend it: 5/5 stars.---This is a honest/unbiased review of a free digital edition courtesy NetGalley and the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BD6P8QL21UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X1JQ#wasThisHelpful","R2BD6P8QL21UR","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is much to admire about Maha Akhtar’s novel Footprints in the Desert. The prose is literary quality and the author paints an exceptionally vivid portrait of exotic locales embroiled in war – and it’s easy to feel the despair and loss experienced by the main characters.I pulled three quotes from the Kindle file to illustrate not only the high quality of the writing but also a greater point with regard to the book’s overall theme: “What has this war done to us? To make us not care about the things that really matter?”“Endings are inevitable, Noura,” Salah began hesitantly. “An ending can be the end of a year, the end of a summer, the end of a war, or the death of someone we loved. Whatever they are, endings always make us feel sad. But we move on. And the people we have lost along the way are the small clear voices in our heads that will be with us always.”“In the end, despite Lawrence’s efforts, the Arab point of view was completely ignored and the British and French promises made by Henry McMahon to Sharif Hussein of Mecca in 1915 disappeared like footprints in the desert sand.”As you can see, the writing is beautiful. What I think you can also see is a theme developing – the main characters all have struggles because of the war; and as the book closes, the author really hits home with the idea that this is a universal struggle still felt by millions of people today and asks readers: “will the conflicts there ever cease?”It’s a powerful book, for sure. Other reviewers already mentioned the two real criticisms I have so I’ll just echo their sentiments. The love stories in the middle and toward the end really killed the momentum for me. I get it, many readers will love them. But I didn’t care. Also, many of the dramatic fight scenes, spy scenes, sneaking around the souk in back alley scenes … it felt as if the writer had less command over her craft when it came to that aspect of the book. There were really beautiful passages dealing with loss and suffering and friends reaching out to help one another … followed by a dramatic chase that felt, well, silly.Anyway, I believe most readers of literary/historical fiction will enjoy this book. I would recommend it: 4/5 stars.---This is a honest/unbiased review of a free digital edition courtesy NetGalley and the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMDRY7I2FOV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA1KNWE#wasThisHelpful","R1AMDRY7I2FOV1","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What I love most about this series is that author Jo Nesbo truly understands how ambiguous and messy life can be, and we don't really get resolutions tied up in pretty little packages.

"I love this series. Some seasons are obviously better than others. And some seasons have silly plot twists for no apparent reason except to fill the 24 hours. Season 6 is unfortunately filled with ridiculous plot twists. From rogue white house staff planning assassinations to Audrey being dead/not dead to Jack's father to the Chinese subplot in the final episodes ... just way too much. It grows tiresome. The first few episodes of season 6 are fantastic, as CTU and the government are dealing with a wave of suicide bombs on US soil.

"This is a powerful multi-generational story that begins with the author as a child in North Vietnam. The writing style is very readable, but the content is difficult at times as the author describes life as a child in war-torn Vietnam. I think one of the most vivid and heart-wrenching things I’ve ever read is the author describing the senseless and brutal death of her father, and the way she reacted at his funeral. It is inexorably sad.This book isn’t entirely sad though. There is a tremendous amount of hope and courage in this book. The author’s life is ultimately a story of resilience and perseverance in the face of overwhelming grief and tragedy.

"I enjoy reading this series. Brad Thor is a great thriller writer. However, two summers ago he wrote a book titled HIDDEN ORDER that was about the Federal Reserve and conspiracy theories … and in telling that story, Thor included history lesson after history lesson and for good measure he mixed it all with a lot of supposition. He did very little to support the soapbox he’d created through credible literary means and despite the fact the book got many great reviews, I’ve maintained my opinion that it was a complete mess.That being said … I loved ACT OF WAR last year and thought, great, Thor is back. And then comes CODE OF CONDUCT and I’m reading the product description and lo and behold Thor is on the conspiracy train wreck again. I was so annoyed, because it lowered my expectations for this book considerably.But … this book starts fantastic. I mean it is flying from the opening pages. One of the best opening few pages I’ve read in a long time. Harvath is putting his girlfriend and her family on a plane to evacuate to Alaska because the US is in total collapse. It grabs you, and then immediately shifts to a week earlier when the events building up to the evacuation began. I mean, you have to read it at that point. You can’t not read it, because the opening pages are that good.So I went from having low expectations to being really excited.The plot shifts to Africa. The Congo. Harvath and a team are tracking down a health facility run by a US charity. There are a few silly moments with a female doctor that tags along. Some cliché caricatures that weren’t necessary, but okay, no big deal. A lot of action though, and Harvath doing what Harvath does best. And no mention of conspiracies. Not yet. This time around Thor really let the plot build before hitting readers with the conspiracy part. In other words he did a much better job with it this time.Harvath and his team make some disturbing finds in Congo, however, and now he has to race back to the US to try and stop a truly devastating attack.OK, that’s where the conspiracy parts come in. Two things, but I’ll do this without any spoilers: the insidious attack that’s being planned, as well as the rationale for the attack, has been done many times by many authors and it’s not exactly a new storyline; and the conspiracy part … it’s so convoluted, I just had to bear it and push through until Harvath started shooting people again.This is a mix of mostly extremely good parts, a couple cliché caricatures, plus a silly conspiracy that requires a complete suspension of disbelief in order to get through the final third of the book.I am glad I read it. I will look forward to the next book in the Harvath series. I will hope against hope that it’s not another conspiracy job.I would recommend it to thriller fans: 3.5 / 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWP9DBTGS4822/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1PD344#wasThisHelpful","RWP9DBTGS4822","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my opinion this is the finest book in the Gabriel Allon series. Daniel Silva is more than just a thriller writer—he’s a literary genius. The writing is lyrical, chilling, mesmerizing … so many ways to describe it, all of them good.THE ENGLISH SPY is about settling old scores, a final restoration, and ultimately going home and starting over. The story is masterfully paced. It begins with an assassination and then carefully and methodically Silva begins to unveil the various layers.Gabriel and Christopher Keller—an assassin who once upon a time was hired to kill Gabriel—chase an IRA bomb maker with an insidious past. Only it turns out that Gabriel’s own past is closely tied to the bomb maker, and very quickly the chase becomes incredibly personal.This is simply a brilliant novel, on so many levels. No one writes literary thrillers even close to the level of Daniel Silva.

"I was interested to read this book because I love to travel and I have a lot of respect for what people in the airline industry do on a daily basis to keep commerce humming despite the constant threats we face in our post-9/11 world. I think any job that is so unlike what most of us do on a daily basis has a certain glamorous allure to it – and flight attendant is certainly in that category.This memoir has a bit of everything – the chapters I found most intriguing however were the ones that dealt with in-flight emergencies, unruly passengers, travelers on the FBI’s terror watch list, and what it was like to be a flight attendant on 9/11.A great deal of the book is spent cataloging the glamorous party lifestyle of Virgin Air flight attendants. Richard Branson is in the book. It’s fun and entertaining and there are many “I can’t believe she did that” moments. A lot of alcohol, a lot of sex, and a lot of things that are included for shock value … but I wouldn’t make the mistake of dismissing this as a serious work. Along with the outrageous behavior is a powerful story of a woman who escaped an abusive relationship and succeeded in life.My guess is most readers won’t find everything in this book to their liking, but I think that’s true with most books. The writing is smart, funny and entertaining – and even if all the chapters don’t agree with your taste or sensibilities, there is a lot here to admire.---I received an advance galley courtesy Penguin Random House First to Read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AA8NJVDNM2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4H0Q#wasThisHelpful","R27AA8NJVDNM2M","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I, RIPPER was definitely “outside the box.” It’s unlike anything else I’ve ever read. I love the title and how “I, Ripper” is incorporated into the story. Stephen Hunter is a brilliant writer and I also love how he told this tale in late nineteenth century British English.The story is told from alternating viewpoints – a journal kept by Jack the Ripper and a memoir written by a newspaper writer who covered the crimes. The writer, Jeb, admits he is not very heroic, but assures readers there is a hero later in the story.I wasn’t real keen on this book early on. The opening journal entries are graphic murders followed by graphic sexual encounters followed by graphic murders. At one point I wondered if the book was simply going to be a fictionalized recounting of everything gruesome … but then finally, Jeb begins to channel his inner-Sherlock Holmes and work up a profile of who Jack the Ripper really is – and from that point forward I was unable to put the book down.There are some tense scenes as Hunter builds to a dramatic conclusion. There are some “twists” and a few predictable moments as well. Taken as a whole, this is an incredibly imaginative book that is sure to entertain horror/thriller/crime fiction fans: 4/5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE7O72VL2F3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OR40#wasThisHelpful","REE7O72VL2F3N","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a violent book with a lot of bullets, but it would be a mistake to categorize it as simply an action book. Cole is always snarky and Pike is the ultimate tough guy, but above everything else the Cole/Pike books—and TAKEN especially—are about loyalty and friendship.Longtime readers will know that Pike always keeps his Jeep pristine … but Cole with his Corvette? Not so much. There is a beautifully written scene in this book where Cole is missing and Pike is in limbo waiting for something to do—and he washes Cole’s Corvette. It illustrates perfectly the many layers and complexities of this novel. It’s not only about the bullets.If you are an Elvis Cole/Joe Pike fan then all you really need to know about this book are two words: “Got you.” Pike is the one talking, and the first 300-plus pages are worth reading just to set-up this one statement.If you are not already an Elvis Cole/Joe Pike fan … then you should buy this book, because you’re missing out on an incredible series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2LECP1ED1B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ERIJWU#wasThisHelpful","R3V2LECP1ED1B1","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pace, plot, tension -- it's extraordinary. In fact, I've never read a thriller by any other author that had me turning pages as anxiously as this book.There's a tense, climactic scene near the end where Ryan goes on television to a live national audience -- and he's got Ding and Clark covertly inside enemy territory, coordinating a strike to decapitate the enemy command structure -- that is absolutely mind-blowing in its intensity.

I highly recommend this book and the entire series: 5/5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VACI6RY15J2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCFG74#wasThisHelpful","R2VACI6RY15J2Q","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite Tom Clancy book. John Clark is one of the baddest good guys in contemporary thriller fiction and this is the story of how he came to be a CIA legend. A lot is happening here -- a drug and prostitution ring is trying to take over the east coast and Clark crosses their paths with devastating consequences; in Vietnam, an American POW is interrogated by a Russian colonel; and at the Pentagon, a group of senior officers plan a rescue operation. Everything comes together, and the result is an extraordinary novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8SVGHSIOZ6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425143325#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8SVGHSIOZ6S","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Stephen Hunter's Earl Swagger and Bob Lee Swagger novels are the ultimate in tough, heroic good guy fiction. In this Earl Swagger novel set in 1950s Mississippi, war hero turned state police sergeant Swagger investigates the disappearance of an old friend. It leads him to a corrupt prison and a hotbed of racism -- and after it nearly costs Swagger his life, he rounds up a posse of like-minded tough men with guns and sets out to right a few wrongs.Hunter's writing is at its absolute best in PALE HORSE COMING. It is storytelling at its absolute finest. Suspenseful and fast-paced, it is an epic battle of good vs. evil set during a very dark time in American history.I highly recommend it to crime fiction / thriller fans: definite 5/5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8AVPAAGMN8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416593640#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8AVPAAGMN8I","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe Brad Taylor’s Taskforce stories are among the best “shorts” on the market by a noted author – and certainly in the thriller/espionage/action genre there is none better right now. Taylor is on the same level as Dean Koontz and Lee Child in terms of knowing what readers want and delivering it in a fast, exhilarating read.THE RECRUIT is a fantastic story that takes place in Peru and features Knuckles and Decoy in the early stages of Decoy’s training/career with the Taskforce. It’s not necessary to have read anything in the series to enjoy this standalone short – but returning readers will certainly appreciate the backstory and added insights into the relationship between Knuckles and Decoy and their careers as SEALs and Taskforce members.As for the plot, again, Taylor does a wonderful job here – it’s a fast read, but it’s a fully developed story with page-turning action. Knuckles has taken Decoy to Peru for a real-world training mission. They’re practicing developing and maintaining covers – and in this case they are posing as contractors at the American embassy doing work with cellular communications. And of course, they manage to stumble onto something that quickly turns a training mission into a seriously dangerous covert act.No spoilers, but Taylor actually manages to create a seriously great ending for this short. A lot of authors are accused of looking for a quick buck with minimal effort when they release kindle stories in the build-up to the release date for a new novel – but no one will be able to say that with a straight face about THE RECRUIT. This is a very satisfying short read and I’d highly recommend it to thriller/espionage/action fans: 5/5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHPM9VJDX9H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4780BE#wasThisHelpful","RVHPM9VJDX9H6","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cass Destry is the protagonist in this outstanding new novel from author Bart Hopkins Jr. Cass is a gun carrying black belt private investigator with a fast sports car and a penchant for running long distances, fast. She’s recently divorced and this week her fast running saved her life. And as you might have read in the product description, her week is only going to get worse from there.The author does a terrific job of piling it on early in the book. It’s humorous at times but definitely ratchets up the tension as the challenges confronting Cass continue to mount. Are they all somehow related? Or is her luck just really that bad?Cass tells a friend she’s doing the Beach Town Boogie trying to juggle everything and stay focused and aware as a stalker and potential murderer closes in on her.This is a fast, fun read from beginning to end. But don’t think the humor is slapstick and the detective story is cliché – no, not even close. Bart Hopkins Jr. is a talented author who writes with sparse, intelligent prose. He understands language and uses it beautifully to create a world on Galveston Island that’s pretty darn close to that magical word “literary” – and I don’t say it lightly. This is a smart book with characters that overcome flaws and face challenges and develop and grow to combat dire situations.It’s artfully constructed, beautifully written, and highly entertaining.Highly recommended: 5 / 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8X4GADR8MG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOU6KXK#wasThisHelpful","RT8X4GADR8MG3","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnaldur Indridason's iconic Inspector Erlendur is only a traffic cop in ""Reykjavík Nights"" as the author spins a mysterious and murderous tale that gives readers a glimpse at Erlendur's early career. The story explores the motivations and circumstances that led Erlendur to become a police officer and to eventually become an inspector.I think a first-time Erlendur reader will likely not be as enamored with this book as someone who is already invested in Erlendur's fictitious world.As for the plot, a homeless man is found drowned in a muddy bog but is quickly forgotten when a woman goes missing. A year later there is no progress on either case and Erlendur is inexplicably fixated on understanding what happened to the homeless man, who is named Hannibal.The more Erlendur investigates the more we glimpse his own past and begin to understand his motivations. The story flashes back to moments when Erlendur crossed paths with Hannibal while working the long Reykjavik night shift as a traffic/beat cop -- and there is one specific moment when Hannibal tires of Erlendur's intervention efforts and shouts, ""What are you trying to make up for?""That's pretty much Erlendur's personal theme -- as it is for many ""good guys"" in fiction -- the idea that we are haunted by something in our past and it drives us to do good things in the present.I did enjoy this book, but to be honest the first half is terribly boring. The only action is secondary to the story and felt as if it was inserted because the author recognized nothing was happening. The second half is more interesting, but even as it builds to the climax there simply are not any tense moments that cause you to turn pages at a frenetic pace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31LW4H5AO7NQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0FZ7RC#wasThisHelpful","R31LW4H5AO7NQU","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It felt like the author was going for literary quality horror/mystery/suspense ... But I just didn't see it. There were a number of glaring formatting/grammatical errors as well.In the beginning, the protagonist Rath is trying to butcher a deer he killed while hunting, but Rath has back issues and the deer sits in the barn for two weeks until it's frozen to the floor. And I swear the author is either trying to make Rath human to readers in a really bizarre way or he's going for some kind of weird allegory -- but he keeps coming back to this deer throughout the book as a mechanism to introduce the next ""twist.""It was just very strange, for lack of a better word.Rath also had a habit of breaking one complete sentence into several fragments like: “It’s Dad. Just. Being Dad.” Which was fine, except suddenly every character in the book started talking this way.He's interviewing a witness who answers his question with: “Envy may be a sin. But. I’m only human.""Soon other detectives are doing it: ""Mandy might show any second. But. I don’t like it.”The ""monster"" and various suspects all do it as well.This might be the reason other reviewers have noted it felt like the author was talking the whole time instead of his characters -- because in fact there was no difference in the narrative and the dialogue with regard to syntax, cadence and etc. Essentially the characters sounded the same, lacked depth and substance, and it was very difficult to care about them.I know other reviewers have mentioned they felt put-off by the characters judging and ranting and railing against the pro-life mindset -- and I agree it felt like the author's viewpoint rather than the characters -- but in fairness Rath also went off against ""liberals"" for paroling violent criminals and allowing them to hurt more innocent people. But obviously pro-life thinkers are not monsters any more than people who identify as liberal want violent criminals on the street to do more harm. The narrative and characters were very judgmental and quick to label people and mindsets in negative ways -- but ironically the characters themselves were poorly drawn cliches.The plot ... It was ok, not horrible. At times it felt suspenseful, but I never reached the point where I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen. In fact, it ends with a cliffhanger that's obviously meant to set up a sequel ... But I don't care enough about the characters to stick with them for a second book.I would have a hard time recommending this book to anyone when there are much better options for investing your time: 2/5 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD64LSNNHJV15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYMDS9M#wasThisHelpful","RD64LSNNHJV15","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first time reading Olen Steinhauer. ALL THE OLD KNIVES is incredibly well written and I plan to read some of the author's previous work as a result.The dialogue and narrative prose are sparse, sharp and witty. The characters are memorable and interesting. The plot and pacing are also excellent. It centers around a terrorist incident at the airport in Vienna, Austria. Five years after the fact, a CIA agent meets his former lover -- who is also former CIA -- for dinner to interview her regarding the events of that fateful night.The story moves back and forth from the present dinner to the night of the terrorist attack -- and the author does so with tremendous skill, as he builds toward a dramatic conclusion.I very much enjoyed the book. It's a quick read, but definitely not shallow.However, there are a couple of things I didn't like. The way CIA personnel are depicted on the night of the terrorist attack was not credible for me and it detracted from the story. The author also created an ending that is pretty much ""love it"" or ""hate it"" territory -- but for me, after 300-plus brilliantly written pages the ending felt gimmicky and was not on par with the rest of the book. Was it clever, tense and suspenseful? Yes, but also gimmicky.Overall though it's a terrific read for fans of thrillers and spy novels: 4/5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJVBUFQBP6H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSYOCC8#wasThisHelpful","R2QJVBUFQBP6H7","A1R6ZZHKY6S067","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6ZZHKY6S067?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this story. Chelsea Bates has a vision and desire to create beauty and a place for rest and renewal after her mother passes away. After a short visit to Starsdale, she settles in an buys an old house intending to turn it into a Bed and Breakfast.Unfazed by the various contractors who advise her to tear it down, she ends up meeting a retired builder named John who takes on the project. The two of them down care that everyone in town things they're crazy. They stick together even when John's son comes home and gets suspicious of Chelsea.Meanwhile, Chelsea's nemesis, her ex-fiance, is planning her demise.I won't give anything else away except to say that the suspense is tight, the characters are lovable, and the romance is sweet. You'll fall in love with the residents of Starsdale and wish that you could visit the architectural wonder that John leaves as his final legacy.This book deals about more than just romance and suspense, but also facing the death of loved ones. My favorite quote reminds us how we are all connected by the love we share which can transcend physical death.“Some call it energy, some say it’s spirit, but I believe it’s the love that people share that keeps them connected, even after death.”― Tallulah Grace, Cliffs of Starsdale","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21G354S12HC1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DENSG9W#wasThisHelpful","R21G354S12HC1B","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I could tell from the very first page that Colorado Hope was going to be a rollicking fun read. Charlene Whitman immediately puts her goody-two-shoes, freaking-adorable, lovey-dovey couple in danger. Then she cuts away to her villain, Lenora Dutton who is hilarious in her self-talk, using words like nosiree, just dandy, skeedaddle, dunderhead, and sniggering or snickering with a mouth full of snark as she plots her nefarious deeds.You just know that their paths will cross and that Lenora's going to be an outrageously bad girl with a heart full of evil as she plots against the good, angelic Grace who happens to blond, and Lenora has dark hair. Meanwhile, confused Monty or Malcolm is acting like a dunderhead or Dudley Do Right, and even though you want Grace and Monty to get back together, you enjoy seeing the tricks Lenora plays on Monty, until it gets to be too much.While Monty rides to the rescue, Lenora figures she'd skeedaddle off with the gold. Well, I won't spoil the ending, but this is a very entertaining Western and brings you right back to the old Western stories and movies. I can practically picture the posse riding after the outlaws.I also love, love, loved, the minor characters, Clare, Eli, LeRoy, and Sarah. I can't wait for the novella between Clare and Eli. The other characters were well done too, from the hypocritical Quaker landlady to the meek county clerk who has a crush on Grace. Finally, love, love, love little Benjamin. What a sweetie and of course the ending when all's well and justice is served fits exactly how a Western should end.It is faith based and entirely clean, not to mention a great adventure and a sweet love story. It features Fort Collins in the 1870s. The characters are amazing: sweet Grace, heroic Monty, and the Banks family, part Cheyenne and expert trackers and horsemen, then there's Clare, the amazing rider and roper, whose my favorite.The romance is also sweet and heart tugging and everything ends happily with a lot of sentiment and good feelings.

"I was really excited to find out about a digital cooking thermometer with a display and readout that sits OUTSIDE of the oven. If you know me, I hate roasting prime rib because of all the anxiety and disasters that await me. It's an expensive cut of meat and usually we don't have it unless there are guests. Some want well done and others want medium rare. Here's what usually happens. I use one of those probes that are attached to my oven, the kind that plugs directly into the oven.I set the temperature, thinking that there is ONE magical temperature where the meat will be done. I stick the probe in the center of the roast and set it to medium-rare [for beef]. What always happens is that I take it out and cut, and there's blood running from the inside.So then my family starts arguing. Some want me to return the roast to the oven. Others say let those who want well done stick their pieces in the microwave. My husband gets mad because it's an expensive piece of meat and he wants it medium, exactly with a tinge of blood but no more.I then slice off the more well-done pieces on both ends of the roast and stick it back in the oven. Meanwhile, the oven has cooled from all of the opening and closing and the roast looks awful with all of these cross cuts and pokes to test. For all about how to cook prime rib, and internal temperatures, see http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beef/ClassicPrimeRib.htm and http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/prime_rib/The MeasuPro digital programmable cooking thermometer is a wonderful invention. It has a long, thin, braided 36 inch cord that allows the probe to be in the meat inside the oven, but the digital display and readout to be outside on the counter. It even has magnetic strips on the back so that you can store it on your refrigerator when you're not using.Using it is simple. You select the meat type you want: beef, pork, chicken, turkey, veal, lamb, ham, duck, ribs, ground beef, ground pork, ground chicken, ground turkey, ground veal, ground lamb, and preferred degree of doneness for preset internal temperature [set to USDA approved doneness level]. Stick the probe into the center of the thickest part, put the roast into the oven and close the door.The braided cord is thin enough to allow the oven to fully close. The package even includes the battery so you can try it out right away. Turn on the Audible Alert switch and there you go. There is also a pre-alert beeping that lets you know the meat is close to done. Finally a bar graph at the top displays the progress of your roast. It's too bad there is no ""time estimate"" so you can estimate when the meat will be cooked, but you should just use the estimate of your recipe.For this trial, I bought a four-and-a-half pound pork shoulder roast. I preheated the oven and stuck the probe into the meat about two inches deep. All I had to do was stick the roast into the oven and wait. Periodically, I'd take a look and the Measupro would tell me what the internal temperature of the meat is. The preset is 170 degrees for pork even though the recipe I used said 185 degrees. You can create a customized temperature profile by following the instructions.Perfect! I let the roast sit for a little bit and removed the probe. I washed only the tip that touched the meat and hung it up on my refrigerator [using the magnetic pads on the back].From now on, I'll have perfect roasts every time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWKWE5YLN1L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHCFWDA#wasThisHelpful","RRWKWE5YLN1L6","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a delightful YA book and a combination of a coming-of-age and a romance. Anna is dumped at a school in Paris for American kids by her parents. All she wants to do is to be home with her friend Bridge and her crush Toph in Atlanta.But she's immediately befriended by the girl-next-door, Mer, and introduced to Mer's clique (minus one), Josh, Rashmi, and Etienne St. Clair. Etienne's girlfriend, Ellie, used to be in the clique but had graduated and gone to college nearby, so Anna fills in in the foursome.The dynamics between all the members of the clique were well delineated and gradually we see Anna and St. Clair bond over daytrips around town and movies, especially cinema and American old films.I liked the book for the most part, except it seemed drawn out to me and repetitive. How many times did Anna have to bang her head on the wall because St. Clair was too dense to admit his feelings and hung onto Ellie, who was for the most part, an invisible character.The ONE thing that totally bothered me and the reason why I didn't give this a five star was the continued off-screen sexual relationship that St. Clair had with Ellie. Over and over again, he was described to go back to Ellie's place and Anna would imagine them ""doing it"" and get disgusted and feel sick.I feel there's a double standard going on here. If St. Clair/Etienne were the girl in the ""friendship"" and Anna were the guy, and it was the girl who had a boyfriend she kept doing, while leading on and flirting with the guy, the character would have been labeled a slut and readers would have been disgusted.Instead, douchebags at the school label Anna a slut for kissing another guy, Dave, when St. Clair had made it clear he was NOT interested in Anna, who determined she wasn't going to keep waiting in the wings as an ""almost"" girlfriend.So, even though it's probably reality that a guy can keep having sex off screen and be considered a romantic hero, whereas a girl cannot, it distresses me that no one, not even Anna, thinks it's not okay for Etienne to have physical relationships with one girl, but emotionally cheat on her with not just Anna, but another girl too [no spoiler here]. Well, there's a passing reference to Etienne feeling bad about it near the end, but in general, it was passed off as A-OK in the book.This knocked the halo off of Etienne for me, and unlike other readers, it meant I did not imagine myself falling for the Etienne's of the world. Usually I can fall for a guy who's a player, because he's made an exception for the heroine, or that the playing was in the past. But an emotional cheater, hmmm... that's more insidious than a plain old player, you know, because in many ways, emotional cheating is much, much worse. So, even though the story has the typical happy ending, it came SO late and the school year was about to finish, that I had a hard time getting invested in the romance. It was more like, okay, is this car wreck going to happen or not?Anyway, I did enjoy the overall story and love the virtual travel of being in Paris. I will read the next book because it's based in San Francisco and Berkeley, which is where I live, so I'm interested to see what the author has done with my city.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNT7URTQKLX0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046ECFRM#wasThisHelpful","RNT7URTQKLX0R","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a nice story about a woman running a charity for feeding the hungry and at the same time running away from personal relationships.Stacy's biggest worry is funding for her charity. So she enters a dance contest to try and win money to tide the charity over the winter. Along comes a real estate developer named Joe who has decided he wants more out of life than work and money. He tries to win Stacy's heart but she does not want to let him in due to the issues she has with her father.The romance portion of the story was cute, but not developed well enough. Instead we got a great story about Stacy working on the dance contest, the little ""twist"" at the end, and then some tension and everything is resolved.I'm not really sure that Stacy should just drop everything and trust Joe just because he volunteers at the gardens. But since the author was probably given guidelines of the length of the story [i.e. could not exceed a certain number of pages/words], she has to resolve the love story too quickly.It doesn't take away the enjoyment of reading about the heroines who help her community, but as a romance, it was light and on the surface.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2OMOLBI8WKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALTVJ8W#wasThisHelpful","RG2OMOLBI8WKZ","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The action was hot and steamy, and funny.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RS5YT20E6S1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C81G1P2#wasThisHelpful","R3RS5YT20E6S1I","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not usually a fan of virgin sexpots and at first this book seemed to head that direction. Rory Carmichael has escaped her strict grandmother and great aunt from her comfortable, but constraining suburban home to the big city of Chicago. However she wasn't truly striking out on her own because her grandmother found her a place to live with the son of her doctor, a family friend.Alec, the hunk with the house, is a reforming bad boy. For one thing, he's put himself on a celibacy diet after his little head gets him fired from an important job. Obviously sparks fly when they meet.The story was predictable and I would have not liked it as much if it weren't for the subplot, where Rory is looking for her long lost twin sister Michaela who ran away from home 10 years ago.Believe it or not, I would have rather had less sex stuff and more on the relationship between the sisters, but sometimes it felt like Rory forgot about her quest for her sister. It got better near the end, but because this was a short Blaze romance, the author was probably told not to explore more fully the dynamics of the sisters.I'm going forward to read the next book Up To No Good which is about Michaela, the long lost sister.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVOLP8RIZBIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VYBWTK#wasThisHelpful","REVOLP8RIZBIG","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This modern Beauty and the Beast story is captivating and endearing. Archer's a hero you just can't help but side with. Everything's been against him his entire life, and he's become a recluse, a man the small town of Pelion shuns.Bree Prescott is running from her past and the visions that haunt her. She ends up in Pelion and immediately runs into Archer who mutely helps her when she dropped her items coming out of a drugstore.Soon, she finds out he's considered strange and that no one seems to know anything about him. But Bree is a woman of compassion and curiosity, and her attempts to make friends with Archer are heartwarming and full of possibilities.You can't help but get drawn into their love story. Only Bree can see Archer for the man he is, but he has been isolated so long that he doesn't have the confidence to deal with society. Meanwhile, Archer's cousin, the town sheriff, is determined to get his way with Bree by cutting Archer down every chance he gets, as well as leading Archer astray.I won't give the rest of the story away, but the villains do their best to ruin Archer and Bree's life.Watching Archer unfold and grow from the ruined, destroyed soul he was to a strong, confident hero was the best part of this novel. As well as the hot and frequent steamy love scenes as Bree awakens his dormant passion and desire.I love this story, especially how Bree kept going to his gate and slowly getting acquainted with him, even when he was so unsure and antisocial. A 5-star coming of age love story and a definite keeper!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y22KK7UOMYIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I29VGMC#wasThisHelpful","R2Y22KK7UOMYIH","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very interesting compilation of the lives of pro basketball playing wives. It was full of drama and intersecting story lines and personal tragedies. However because of the parallel subplots, it skipped all over the place, from one character to another character and some of the transitions were confusing. Like who are we talking about now?In any case, the book reads like a gossip column and provided some insights into the lives of the super rich and famous athletes and their women and problems. However the plot was fairly predictable and a lot of the issues opened up were brushed under at the end, for example, the violent past one of the wives hid caused her a lot of heartache and post traumatic stress. It was like, time for the story to finish and everything resolved heartily.The villains were also cardboard and pure evil and again, everything was resolved neatly without too much fuss once they were exposed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQBAOKCZMO82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049B1VM2#wasThisHelpful","R1MQBAOKCZMO82","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you can buy the ""love at first sight"" then the rest of the story was sweet, cute, and endearing. Avery, our prickly heroine, runs down the hallway and bumps into Cam, almost doing a faceplant, except he's there to help her. He almost runs her down with his truck for their next meeting, and then it turns out he lives across the hall in her apartment building.With that out of the way, Cam is like the perfect book boyfriend, loyal, quick to forgive, and persistent. He plays friend for most of the semester and every time Avery runs from him or cuts him off, he comes by and tries to talk to her. It helps that he has a huge ego and is not as easily hurt or demoralized by a woman who constantly turns him down and makes snide remarks about him.Without seeing his point of view, we don't have a clue why he is enamored with Avery. Sure, she's probably pretty, but there are pretty girls everywhere on college campuses. We don't know if he's aware that she has psychological problems. There's no indication he is clued in at first. Avery's best friend Brittney is a psych major and suspects something, but Avery is able to hide from her questions too well for anything to really come out.It was pretty easy for the reader to see that Avery had been sexually abused. This is a common trope in New Adult literature, and I was eager to see how this author handled it, particularly since a lot of stories use it for shock value and then pass it off as easily solved by hot, hunky, boyfriend who melts heroine's resistance.Ms. Lynn develops the story better than most. Avery is damaged and exhibits avoidance. She is also uncomfortable with certain positions and wonders how she'd respond if he tries to take things too fast, which he doesn'tThe ending is satisfactory since Avery confronts her ghosts and resolves her feelings for Cam. Of course, who wouldn't? He really is a knight in shining armor. I, at least, couldn't see any flaws in him. Even his supposed secret was justified and made Avery wish she had someone who cared about her that much [which she does now, but not before]I did notice quite a few editing problems, garbled sentences and typos. One even changed the meaning of the sentence when Cam said he ""hadn't"" been with anyone else, the typo said ""had"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEYMUXGI8C1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3342T2#wasThisHelpful","R1WEYMUXGI8C1D","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a steal! Read them at the gym, in the subway, on the beach. These three fun and sweet books are a steal! I love the authors' voices and the humorous way the love stories unfold. Pick them up now while they're 99c and enjoy!Here are my reviews:[Cover (Story) Girl by Chris Mariano]Way too delightful opposites attract story. Min He and Gio couldn't be more different. He is a staid, solid, if not quite boring museum curator, and she's a colorful mysterious Korean girl prone to fantasies and make believe. But their romance develops despite their differences and each brings color and perspective to the other. Cover (Story) Girl is one of the most enjoyable stories I've read lately and I finished it in a few hours, staying up late into the night. It is also one of the few romances written in the male point of view. You'll come to love Gio, even if you think he's a stick in the mud at the beginning.I can't wait to read more by this author. I also enjoyed learning about the culture on Boracay Island.[Vintage Love by Agay Llanera]What a delightful book. I was sucked in from the very first line, ""Life is full of expiration dates.""When Chrissy's favorite grand-aunt, Mama Maring, dies and leaves behind a house full of vintage clothes, collectibles and furniture, Chrissy and her BFF, Bea, decide to hold a rummage sale to raise money for a well deserved vacation.The two friend meet an arrogant young man, Vince, who looked over Mama Maring's things as if they were fakes trying to rip him off. Chrissy is chagrined that such a beautiful face could be wasted on an ass. However, when they go to consign the rest of the loot, the store they walk into belong to none other than Vince and his father.Uh oh! I won't give it away except to say that the story is fun to read, the side characters are colorful, Chrissy is a heroine you want to root for, and Vince becomes more endearing as the story goes on.What I like the most is Miss Llanera's voice and the way she tells the story in a cheerful, humorous manner. I enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting. I definitely will look forward to more stories from Miss Llanera.[All's Fair in Blog and War by Chrissie Peria]I've been enjoying light-hearted Filipina romances and this is one of the cutest. Five Cuevas and competing blogger Jesse Ruiz have been invited by the Macau tourism board on a complimentary trip to Macau for publicity purposes. Five takes an instant dislike to the arrogant, stuffy Jesse who exudes superiority with his every gesture. He's the one with the hot shot camera, the expert in advertising, the know-it-all. But things change when Cuevas has a late night fright and ends up in Jesse's room. Not only were they assigned to be travel buddies together, but they enjoy being side-tracked to the less well-traveled areas on Cueva's sister's list, and a super kilig midnight photo shoot in front of an abandoned church.I've never been to Macau, but after reading this book, I have a hankering to go, especially if I get to be travel buddies with a handsome, sexy blog buddy. The descriptions are awesome, the food is to be inhaled, and the fun adventures make you feel like you're right there with them. It turns out to be a really sweet story and a happy read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXK2VA67L8R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB7ZL9Q#wasThisHelpful","R3BXK2VA67L8R5","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the first page, tension sizzled as Max meets Rose after being jailed many years for her sister's murder. Rose is not sure what to make of Max, but all the unresolved feelings make it hard for her to ignore him.Add an overprotective sheriff and a town full of potential suspects, and we're off on a wild ride to figure out who REALLY murdered Rose's sister and who is after Rose right now.The action is fast and nonstop, gluing me to the pages until the wee hours of the night. What I liked about this story was that Rose was brave enough to give Max a second chance even when evidence pointed to him as still being a danger to her.The ending is a big surprise, but after looking back through the clues, it all made sense. Chantel Rhondeau does twisted villains so well. She'll have you looking over your shoulder at the ordinary people you think you know so well, but don't really.

"Americanah follows the life of Ifemelu, a young Nigerian woman of Igbo origin who immigrates to America because it was the country her boyfriend, Obinze, admires.Predictably enough, Ife and Obinze end up going in separate paths, even though they had truly believed they were in love and had planned on marrying.The story jumps between Ife's life in America and contrasts it with Obinze's stay in England. While Ife succeeds in getting a sponsored green card and makes a successful career for herself in America, Obinze is an illegal alien who is eventually deported.Both Ife and Obinze are great observers, the silent types that analyze and catalog the behaviors of the people around them. This allows the author to make a lot of observations and present them to her readers.Through Ifemelu, we learn of the shock she felt when she realized that in America, she was black, and that every interaction she has with people in America was tinged with race, primarily skin color and hair texture. Her observations led her to write a blog about race and the observations of a Non American Black (NAB) on the condition of the American Black. She learned to be politically correct, to be offended by statements she didn't quite understand and to be interested in issues faced by American Blacks, even though she did not identify with them.Ifemelu's journey includes the obligatory White boyfriend, one who embodied Adichie's personification of White Privilege. Curt, otherwise known as the Hot White Ex was always optimistic, cheerful, entitled, and overly solicitous of her. Once, when an owner of a beauty salon said to Ifemelu, 'we don't do curly,' Curt loudly complained and made a scene, forcing the salon to perform their services. Ifemelu, meanwhile, feared they would do a horrible job. Later, she expounds that cross cultural relationships were too full of explanations and doubted that if it hadn't been for the explanations, if there were really anything to be said. She destroys the relationship by sleeping with another man.Next, she is in a relationship with Professor Hunk, an American Black. He is just a little too perfect, and much too polished to be real. Careful, fastidious and very judgmental, Blaine, or Professor Hunk, made sure Ifemelu ate non-GMO foods, did not waste her apple cores, and molded her thoughts and feelings to contemporary issues. He and his cohort of friends had a singular way of thinking, of viewing society and the country, and every thought Ifemelu had was measured against this standard. It was another stifling relationship, and again, Ifemelu took out the sledgehammer and destroyed it.All along, there was the thread in the background of Ife and Obinze's dealings, how they could be real and understood each other. Obinze observes how phony his classmates become when they marry, how they suddenly are interested in art collections or antique furniture, how effected the airs they take on. But he, too, has become corrupted, by taking a wife he does not love, but is a beauty queen, and going through the rituals of parties, and celebrations in the Nigerian high society.When Ifemelu returns to Nigeria, she avoids Obinze for as long as she could. However, as soon as they are together again, they rekindle their friendship and love. For to love is to be heard, seen, known, and understood. To not wear masks, and pretend to be what you're not. To be happy with what you are.Obinze: You know what I have felt for so long? As if I was waiting to be happy.Ifemelu: She had never had this before, to be listened to, to be truly heard, and so he became newly precious.And this, really, is the theme of Americanah, that of being authentic in a land of pretense, of seeing the truth and speaking it, because otherwise, you exist, ""trudging through lives in which they were neither happy nor unhappy.""To Ifemelu, authenticity is in Nigeria, in the land and soil and culture of your upbringing, among people who truly get you, and with whom you do not have to pretend.America, in many ways, is a dream, a concept, an idealization of the way things should be, but rarely are.Chimamanda summarizes America as follows:The best thing about America is that it gives you space. I like that. I like that you buy into the dream, it's a lie but you buy into it and that's all that matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWVJLH8XX4C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9ET4MC#wasThisHelpful","R1YWVJLH8XX4C9","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll never go back to metal muffin pans. I poured my favorite muffin recipe into the pan. I lengthened the baking time by about 25% because the silicon doesn't transfer heat as well as the metal, but the bonus is no burnt bottoms. The mini muffins popped out clean and easy. The pan is very flexible so you can push the muffins out from underneath once everything has cooled. Great for making all those mini snacks that are so popular these days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRK4RVMFIVLXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6VFUVY#wasThisHelpful","RRK4RVMFIVLXF","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel and Grant are both married to the wrong people. But despite their mutual attraction, they stand on principles and upload their values, even in the face of dastardly betrayal. Events conspire to force them to repeatedly cross paths, starting with the fact their children are dating. However both of them stand firm and do not take the easy way out.What I liked about Distorted Loyalty is the fierce conviction on Rachel’s part to be honest with those around her. Grant, while having equally strong convictions, is afraid to face his own feelings of inadequacy and rejection.  Many times, Rachel could have taken a less noble road, but she knew that any relationship based on dishonesty would end up in disaster.The other refreshing thing about this story is the emotional maturity of the hero and heroine. Even though they have a slew of problems that keep them apart, none of it is based on immaturity, silly misunderstandings and overreactions—the stuff you see in other romance novels. Instead, these are real people dealing with overwhelming problems. They are tempted, but do not fall into bed or do things that they would be ashamed of or regret. This book shows that not every romance book has to have sex and flowers, but that a love based on emotional strength is more likely to last and be satisfying for a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOIJ67FCPDSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS326DI#wasThisHelpful","R1IOIJ67FCPDSP","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first I was skeptical that something which looks plastic can survive in an oven. It was floppy and you can actually fold it in half. However it can withstand up to 480 degrees F and 250 degrees C.The pan is clean and smooth. Because it is floppy, you should put it on a cookie sheet before filling the batter. It makes it easy and safe to place into the oven and remove.My muffins baked evenly without sticking. I didn't spray any oil or butter the bottom of pan. In fact, the little globs of spillage which usually burns onto a metal pan flaked right off.Once the muffins cooled, it was easy to push them out by using your finger underneath. I didn't try shaking them out, but I bet that works too. Everything peels away, including the little edges that got caught on top, so your muffins are uniform, round and clean.Simply shake it out and stick it in the dishwasher.Another use for the silicone tin is to use it like an ice tray to freeze soup bases and stock. Since it is floppy, you don't have to knock it to pop out the cubes. Simple push out the frozen sauce into a baggie. If you made a lot of tomato soup, or baby food, you can easily pop out serving sized pieces and thaw.This is a very versatile product and makes me want to throw out my old, rusted or scratched muffin tins.One more IMPORTANT note for bird owners. Teflon (non-stick) muffin pans are dangerous to birds. Better to use the silicone ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAHM7S3TNUB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNVBCLK#wasThisHelpful","R3AAHM7S3TNUB5","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both Major Pettigrew, a 68-year old widower and Mrs. Ali, a widow are highly observant and quick with droll remarks, much of which is lost on the the clueless buffoons at their small village of Edgecombe St. Mary's.The book opens with the death of the Major's only brother Bertie. Seems the Pettigrews owned a matching pair of Churchill shotguns that was bestowed to them by a grateful Indian prince for rescuing a princess, the stuff of family tales and legends. The Major's main concern was reuniting the pair of Churchills, one which went to Bertie and the other to the Major upon his father's passing.Mrs. Ali shows up in the first scene at the Major's door to collect paper money, but he is in an embarrassing state of underdress and fainting because his brother has just died. She quickly and efficiently handles him and they bond over their love of literature.When Mrs. Ali laughs, the Major thought it sounded like singing, and there begins a friendship that has the village gossiping about how unseemly it is.The Major is more concerned about his guns, which represents old England, the last days of the Raj, than about the people around him. An endless stream of frustrations and irritations in the form of his social-climbing son, Roger, the neighbors and members of the golf club, the other single women in the village with suitable English parentage, the vicar and his wife, his sister-in-law, and Mrs. Ali's impetuous nephew Abdul Wahid are thrown across his path.His feelings for Mrs. Ali deepen, but at the darkest moment, his concern over the guns overshadows his gallantry and he allows ...

Poor Harry, even though he's from another book (That Kind of Guy), I still want him to win one at the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPN5QL4JHDN47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086TDYFU#wasThisHelpful","RPN5QL4JHDN47","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lost Flower is a multi-faceted story of intersecting lives. Lacy Stone is on a journey to find the source of her vision. Sampaguita Navarro has a dream but no confidence in her abilities to achieve them. Alejandro is torn between his love for Sampaguita and God. Adam Shaw is running from his past, and Frankie Lloyd is seeking closure to right past wrongs.Five people with five secrets collide on the white sand beach of Boracay, idyllic on the surface, but simmering with resentment and conflict between the resort developers and displaced natives, the Aetas. Lacy and Adam are the interlopers, but they have the money and the power. Sampguita and her family are the losers, but their paths cross in an explosive manner.I truly enjoyed this story and could not put it down. There is so much story packed into this book. It is fast paced, perhaps too fast. The scenes flew by with lots of actions and happenings. This is not a family saga equivalent to Hawaii, but a wonderful tale about ideals, love, loyalty, and sacrifice all set in the backdrop of an island paradise. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKE5319830J1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYNFTHS#wasThisHelpful","RKE5319830J1I","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That Kind of Guy, a feel-good, sweet, and twisted romance between Anton, the smooth hunky-dory player and Julie, manang extraordinaire, the perpetual big sister who gives everyone else love advice and predicts doom and gloom for all their relationships.When faced with a choice between Anton, sexy alpha-playa Mr. Wrong who acts differently with Julie than any other woman, and Harry, nice-beta literary type who is understanding and loyal, what does Manang Julie do?Well, I won't tell.

"This is a delightful if somewhat long, drawn-out story about a 30 year old Asian woman who is being pressured to find a boyfriend by her domineering grandmother. While the tastes of Chinese/Japanese culture sprinkled throughout the book was pretty cool, the story never gets deeper than the surface conflicts, a lot of which seem made up just to cause Lex, the heroine, more pain, embarrassment, and disappointment.Lex is supposed to be an ultra fit volleyball player, but she comes across as clumsy, prickly, and has the worst luck. She is also suffering from PTSD from a past experience with men, but the author only hints at it through the first half of the book. Although she makes great progress in her friendship with Aiden, she never really gets too close to him, and their interaction is limited to a lot of bantering, mock cut-downs,and competitiveness.Aiden really is a great guy, but the author does not let him really see or understand what Lex has been through. He and Lex never discuss the main impediment to her ability to build a relationship with a man. Instead, the author rushes the finish with a vague understanding of two things that are very important to Lex, whether Aiden has received Christ as his Savior [this was never made clear, only that he went to the church and spoke to the pastor], and dealing with her PTSD.Instead, she went into great detail on the MRI, the orthoscopic surgery and recovery, and all of the pain and suffering Lex goes through in losing her dream of playing volleyball at a professional club. I felt letdown at the end. The second injury seemed unnecessary, and nothing really was resolved about Lex's job, her knee, and even her temporary living arrangement. Instead, they force a victory on Granny by having Aiden declare he is her boyfriend in the last few pages.I felt shortchanged in not being shown Lex and Aiden talk about their relationship and experience the affection they had for each other. The other thing I found odd was Lex's father's detachment to his daughter when she was injured and in need of help. If she were my daughter, she'd be living in my house during her recovery, and not on her own in a ratty, one bedroom, ground floor apartment in a sketchy neighborhood. The family did not seem truly caring of each other, and all the members, with the exception of cousin Venus, seemed to be detached and manipulative, or maybe designed to give Lex maximum frustration. But in any case, it didn't leave me with a good, happy family feeling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCG005B7AWN03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SF02NC#wasThisHelpful","RCG005B7AWN03","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was ultrasweet, giving you all the delicious tingly sugared halo-halo feelings the entire ride. Matteo is deadly cute with light blue hair and Carlisle is too smart and too skittish for her own happiness. I love the geology jokes, nerd humor, the outrageously awesome notebook Matteo kept about his experiment on getting Carlisle to fall in love with him. The Evil Ex got his comeuppance too, and through the entire story, we see how capable Carlisle is, even while she doubted herself. I also love that she is a female programmer, although a front-end developer, she still provided the leadership to make sure the nightly builds were on track, while her douchebag boss (and Ex) took all the credit.Awesomely fun book.

"I've been enjoying light-hearted Filipina romances and this is one of the cutest. Five Cuevas and competing blogger Jesse Ruiz have been invited by the Macau tourism board on a complimentary trip to Macau for publicity purposes. Five takes an instant dislike to the arrogant, stuffy Jesse who exudes superiority with his every gesture. He's the one with the hot shot camera, the expert in advertising, the know-it-all. But things change when Cuevas has a late night fright and ends up in Jesse's room. Not only were they assigned to be travel buddies together, but they enjoy being side-tracked to the less well-traveled areas on Cueva's sister's list, and a super kilig midnight photo shoot in front of an abandoned church.I've never been to Macau, but after reading this book, I have a hankering to go, especially if I get to be travel buddies with a handsome, sexy blog buddy. The descriptions are awesome, the food is to be inhaled, and the fun adventures make you feel like you're right there with them.

"This is a hot romantic suspense with not one, but two couples. There's Gillian and Drew, who are forced to work together when Gillian is hired to reform Drew's public image. Apparently he is too rough on the press and uses too many curse words. Then there is Audrey and Brett, who are on opposing sides to the MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) scene.Audrey runs an organization that is against violent sports, and Brett, of course is the fighter with the heart of gold.The storylines intersect around the villain, Millie, who works for Audrey as a reporter for the organization. She has had a run in with Drew Black and is out to get him.Both couples are immediately attracted to each other. Where Gilliam and Drew's interaction is confrontational and sizzling, Brett and Audrey are sweet and endearing. There is a lack of romantic tension to both couples. They like each other and are willing to see the good in each other.The tension comes from the villain and the acts of violence, bomb threat, hit and run, fire bomb, and shooting, all aimed at a vendetta against Drew. There really weren't any other suspects than the obvious one, so while the story was interesting, it was predictable and not suspenseful enough. Brett easily forgave Audrey, and Gillian easily went along with whatever schemes Drew proposed. The entire plot felt choreographed, where you knew that the only reason they went outside all together was to allow the villain the chance to get in a potshot.The love scenes were really good, and it was interesting how the two couples contrasted each other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AGA5JWZPP4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030CVQQC#wasThisHelpful","R4AGA5JWZPP4P","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happen to like Kimmy Domingo, the heroine written so the reader can hate her and be pleased that she is hurt and damaged. But then, I'm American and I think Kimmy is just brutally honest and has no time for fakery and conventions.Yes, she was selfish as far as ignoring her mother and friends while on her ""gap year."" And as I suspected, she was ultimately the cause of her groom ditching her, and was not a hapless victim of circumstances.She was self-centered, blamed people without understanding them, and didn't bother to look beyond their immediate effect on her. Reminds me of Rachelle Ayala's heroine Evie Sanchez.However once she understood the true nature of her relationships with her best girlfriend, her mother, and her childhood love, she realized she needed to see and understand others and change her ways. This delightful story of growing up, reconciliations, and understanding means Kimmy will no longer run from her problems, but stay and rebuild the relationships that are important to her.In the end, I loved the way Kimmy's warped friendship with Chesca was portrayed and resolved, as well as the ever loyal Isabel, and that Kimmy and Manolo have decided to try again as grownups with open communication and understanding as the goal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHI9S3ZHIBRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OL2NNS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHI9S3ZHIBRG","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shelley Daniels is as tough as they come. She's a secret agent on vacation, recovering from a gunshot wound, and she's sworn off casual sex.Gavin Hart is a thief on the run. He witnessed a murder and now the crooks are after him. He crashes into Shelley's opera booth and convinces her to help him escape his enemies. It turns out they are the very ones who shot Shelley in her last job.Both Shelley and Gavin have had traumatic childhoods and have been unlucky in love. However, as they are on the run together they have to pretend to be closer than they actually are.What I really liked about this story is the unfolding of the romance between Shelley and Gavin. She's the tough one and he's the sensitive one. She knows how to shoot guns and he doesn't know how to handle one. But Gavin has skills too, those having to do with stealth, climbing, and sneaking. And somehow he sneaks into her guarded heart.I also enjoyed the humor and minor characters in this book. Shelley is smart-mouthed and knows how to throw an insult. Meanwhile, a confused grandmother figure and a frightened little girl capture your heart as they endear themselves to Gavin and Shelley.The only thing I have to warn you is that this book is a trap. I stayed up until 3:00 am to finish it because I just had to know what happened next. But it was worth it.

"This was a frightening recounting of the author's relationship with an abusive man. I was hoping to find more hints on how to predict when a man would become abusive, but from what the author wrote, it is hard to tell. Conor was charming and sweet, knowing how to play to Leslie's vulnerabilities. It was not until he got her in a committed relationship that signs of violence showed up. In some sense, he felt she was already trapped. Trapped by love, trapped by convention, and trapped by her own pride of not wanting to admit her relationship wasn't perfect. One of the signs was that she paid for and bought her own engagement ring because she wanted her family and friends to think of him as a knight in shining armor. In that sense, she colluded with him to keep his behavior toward her secret.In retrospect, the clues were small, overreaction when a male friend called her and possessiveness when other men spoke to her. Although Leslie's story is not easy to tell, it is helpful to women to know that ordinary people get reeled into abusive relationships and that it is no their fault for being clueless or somehow inviting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QNNNV7JE94OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312377452#wasThisHelpful","R1QNNNV7JE94OT","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hannah is an ordinary but not quite ordinary teenager at a private college when she is drafted by Quin the sun god to sub for the Goddess of Love. Hannah immediately has a crush on Quin. Who wouldn't? When he's the sun god and paints with lights and shadows?In the first two books, Hannah fixes things up for the students in Ford River College, but in book three, her own love life heats up. There's Robbie, a normal guy, basketball player and very charming. Unbeknownst to Robbie, Hannah can read his every thought, how much he admires her, how worried he is that she won't go out with him, how carefully he plans his date with her and then there's the LOVE LETTER. Swooon!!!If I was Team Diego in the first book and ""eh"" in the second book, I'm definitely Team Robbie in this one. Robbie is man enough to love a goddess in training, put himself out there, and not play the doormat. When Hannah is caught in Quin's arms and tries to throw Robbie a bone, he refuses it and walks away despite his broken heart.Meanwhile Hannah and Quin and the missing Goddess of Love sort things out with the interference of Vida, the Moon Goddess and Diego, God of the Sea, bent on getting revenge on Quin for a lost lover.Hannah makes some bold decisions and realizes the visions and dreams she sees in her mind are not of her past but of something else. And when you become a goddess, you now have eternity.[spoilers below]But Robbie. He only has this one life. In choosing between now and forever, Hannah makes a deal with Quin. She was born a human, a mortal, and please can she experience this one life with this one mortal without her goddess powers [means she can no longer read Robbie's mind nor control his actions or send him thought waves.]With that, she leaps boldly into the unknown and exciting adventure of romantic love with no guarantees, no strings, and no backup plan, because true love can only be known by faith.I'm sad to see this series end, but it is one of my all time favorites. I only wish there will be more Hannah stories in all her many lives, and I suppose there are, because she's there in every love story experienced between two beating hearts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOQ1GQBXN66R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D54G8SQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DOQ1GQBXN66R","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seems that things are disappearing whenever her new boyfriend, Neil, is around and she cannot figure out what is happening.

Were they or were they not meant to be together? Is Hannah part of the old legends or is she just an ordinary girl caught up in an age old feud?Hannah gains some victories and ends up frustrated, not knowing her fate. I for one, like her adventures, and hope this series continues beyond the trilogy. I can see it as an ongoing serial since Interim Goddess of Love can only deal with one couple at a time, and there are billions of couples in the world who need her help.I'm really enjoying this series by Ms. Mina Esguerra.

"What a refreshing book. The first thing I noticed is the beautiful, expressive writing detailing the Manhattan art scene and the dreams of young artists. Kitsy Clare uses all five senses, a combination of dialogue, setting, and description to bring her characters to life.Sienna is a computer graphic artists. She loves order and craves balance. Her artwork is neat and pinned together with symmetry, making her feel like everything is verified and provable, and all is shiny and happy in her world. Intense, expressive work sets her nerves on edge and are too messy for her OCD personality.Sienna falls into immediate attraction with an artists' model, Erik, who is quirky, fun, and drop-dead gorgeous. He has the entire female half of the art class panting wet and the male half tense and looking for his faults. Erik is also an artist, but lack of credentials and his expressive work of swooping lines and free-spirited shapes fill Sienna with anxiety and uncertainty.Sienna is torn between dating Dave Hightower, a wealthy classmate whose aunt owns a high-class gallery and lusting over Erik, who she is sure has many women at his beck and call. Although Erik gives off no player vibes, Sienna is hesitant to let her heart go out of control.The story is set up well, with high stakes tension, adorable side characters, a lusciously paintable hero, and a heroine teetering between logic and emotional. Add to that, the beautiful descriptive writing is a joy to read. It captures details, nuances and sensuality with subtlely, without being long-winded or banging in your face graphic.However, the book is too short! It had so much potential to play out the drama between Dave and Sienna, Sienna and her friend who likes Dave, Erik and Dave, and of course the other women vying to model for Erik. I felt like it ended just when I thought I could settle in for a really good story.Also, Erik came off too perfect. There really wasn't any hidden dark secret hinted at by the description. The ending came too quickly and everything wrapped up too neatly. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't ""buy"" the love between the two. They haven't been tested enough and they don't know each other that well. Of course, the story is sold as a novella, and for the length, it does give us enough characterization to get to know the characters. It just doesn't have much of a try-fail cycle for the relationship that makes for a stronger happily ever after.For what it is, it was a delightful quick read with wonderfully skilled writing behind it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGXYXX2X5NFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II7519C#wasThisHelpful","R2YGXYXX2X5NFA","A33H0WC9MI8OVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33H0WC9MI8OVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking a probiotic supplement for several years, and, when I began taking it, noticed a big improvement in my digestion.  Foods that may have caused me a little stomach upset were not a problem, and my bowels became much more regular.  I was curious to see if the Advanced Digestive Enzymes from ZenWise Labs, which contain more ingredients (enzymes) in an herbal formula would be even better.  I still feel fine and don't really notice the big change that I noticed going from none to the capsules I'd been taking.  If a person is disciplined enough to remember to take a rather large capsule before every meal, this formulation would be fine.  I'm not a person who remembers to take supplements without fail, so I'll stick with one that requires remembering only once a day.  But a person who is plagued by rumbles through the digestive system should give these a try.

The pieces are all smoothly finished and have felt bottoms.  Frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality at this price.

The package includes two sprayers for smaller and larger citrus fruits and a little stand to hold the fruit once it has the sprayer inserted.

He could read the words, but the homophones went over his head, and he didn't seem to appreciate them even after I explained the meanings of the similar words.  The story is cute, but a bit sexist in its presentation and spends a lot of time on arguing between the two characters.Personal adult note that I didn't discuss with my grandson:  Why are pirates often portrayed as gallant sailors of the seas?  Most pirates were, and still are, vicious terrorists who plundered ships and often murdered or enslaved their captives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCK1LX0M138Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545818869#wasThisHelpful","RCK1LX0M138Z","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Playing a traditional and fun board game with my five-year-old grandson, just as I did with my children, gives me hope that families can enjoy simple pleasures and don't always need to be within reach of an electronic device for entertainment.  This version of Chutes and Ladders is the same as the one I remember, the one we used so much with our three kids that it finally fell apart.  Just spin the spinner and make your move.  BUT...do not land on a chute.  DO NOT.  The game pieces and the spinner are all sturdy enough to withstand years of playing.  The board is bright and colorful and is well made.  And the best part of the game is that we have such a good time playing the game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6TCQWEXVJU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V82MG2O#wasThisHelpful","R3P6TCQWEXVJU9","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The material of these shelf liners is two thin decorated sides fused to a center core, with the entire thickness being quite suitable for shelf liner.  The shelves in my 40+ year-old cabinets are made of plywood which has seen much use.  My plan was to replace my plastic liners with this new material.  The material itself is similar to the viscose Sham-Wow cloths that were heavily advertised some years ago, but this is thinner.  I cut and washed a piece in my frontload machine as a test and found that it is washable, does not shrink, and there are bits of fuzz from the center core visible after washing.I would go ahead and cut pieces for the rest of my shelves except for one thing:  The material slips around.  If I pull a can or bottle from a shelf, the liner bunches or slips.  The best place to use this material is in a spot where items are not moved very often.  Changing strategy, I'll now use this liner in a cabinet where I keep glasses that don't get used very often, and now they won't rattle every time we walk through that area.  I'm going to put strips on top of the cabinets that are exposed to dust and kitchen grease.  The paper I've used for years has to be discarded each time I get ambitious enough to want to clean up there, and then must be remeasured and recut.  This will be more permanent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVIIPLVRWIZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVMOJVO#wasThisHelpful","RMVIIPLVRWIZG","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandson is almost three, a bit too young for the concepts of adding and subracting, but he immediately knew the numbers and began trying to fit them into the proper-shaped slots.  I sat with him and showed him the school-related pictures on the big, chunky wooden numbers, as we slipped them into the windows.  Along came his five-year-old brother and showed him how to add the numbers.  And tried to explain the number card game to him.  He was delighted to be noticed by his older brother, but didn't understand the game.  That's fine; he'll enjoy this toy for a few years.Being the age he is, he also loaded some little people into the bus and climbed onto it to ride it around.

"The set is comprised of two vehicles that are cleverly designed in that the wheels of the vehicles are also little molds like cookie cutters for pieces of Play-Doh.  The child can then fill in shaped cavities on the vehicles with the shapes cut out by the wheel/cutter and form missiles and other essential weaponry from the three 2 oz. cans of Play-Doh that come with the set.  After forming all the decorations and ballistics, the cans, which have faces on the labels, can be set into the vehicles to be drivers.  The plastic toys are sturdy and roll nicely on the wheels.  My 5-year-old grandson loves Star Wars so he was very engaged by this set.In my maybe curmudgeonly opinion, this set is all planned play and does not encourage creativity in building with the material.  I can remember playing with modeling clay and making my own animals and trees, and so did my children.

They leave much less water and residue on the surface being cleaned, which, of course, speeds up the job.

"This little device comes with almost no instructions among the pages and pages of safety warnings in dozens of languages, but the few pictures were enough to get even a tech dinosaur like me started.  The HP power pack comes with a cord about 12"" long that has a USB connector on one end and a somewhat universal cell phone connector on the other end.  To get started, plug the USB connector into a charger that is plugged into an electrical outlet and plug the other end into the HP power pack.  Lights flash while the power pack charges, and soon the lights stop flashing, and you're in business.  To charge my Samsung phone, I reversed the little cord, putting the USB end into the HP device and the other smaller end into my phone.  When I checked back in half an hour, the phone was showing four bars, full charge, although it never gave me the ""charging complete"" message I get from the charger that came with the phone.  Never mind, it worked fine.  Next, I charged my iPod touch.  Using an appropriate Apple charging cord, I got similar quick results.So, it works fine, and I can see how it could be a  game changer in a situation where I've waited too long to charge my phone and really need to make a call.  My only slightly negative comment might be that the short cord that comes with the HP power pack is very thin and appears to be the flimsy type that breaks and loosens at the ends near the connectors.  The safest way to protect the cord seems to be plugging both ends into the appropriate ports to reduce bending at the ends.

"The SpongeBob SquarePants series is a big step into the offering of complex, character-specific building sets.  I, the grandmother, am not nearly as familiar with Mr. SquarePants as was my 5.5 year-old grandson, whose eyes lit up when I placed this set on the table for him.  He started explaining the character nuances of the various, um, ""people"" represented.  What I noticed immediately was the intricacy of the finished products - a shower, hinges, a brass doorknob.  Also, the plastic itself for the stone walls of Squidward's house are a beautiful mottled grey tone.  The pieces fit together securely and evenly.  This is high-quality material, well manufactured.Grandson, who regularly puts together complex sets from Lego, was eager to get started.  This is where the shortcoming of the set, at least for him, became apparent.  With the Lego sets he builds, he opens the instructions to Step 1, and picks up a plastic bag marked #1 and builds the associated part, following the steps.  With the MegaBloks set, the clear instructions were there, but the pieces he needed for the first half of the project, Squidward's home, were mixed into a few big bags, along with pieces from the other half of the set, SpongeBob's house.  I attempted to assist by removing all the pieces that clearly didn't belong to Squidward and sorting remaining pieces by color and putting them into a muffin tin.  This helped a little, and he happily built the sidewalk for Squidward.  He lost interest.  Over the last couple of weeks he has, numerous times, as he lives in the other half of our duplex, decided to tackle it again, requesting that I sit with him; but he quickly gets discouraged by sorting the hundreds of pieces to find the right one to go on to the next step. I've decided to put the sorted pieces into separate containers and put the entire set away for awhile.  A key improvement would be to bag the pieces in sequentially marked bags to avoid the sorting of 498 pieces in order to start, and then having to re-sort for each succeeding step.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAH4SUJUVHZ4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U29M53E#wasThisHelpful","RAH4SUJUVHZ4L","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is not an athlete now, but he was pretty active in his younger days and his knees are, well, on their last legs.  He'll probably need knee surgery in the next few years, but right now he is very faithful about using TheraBands tied around his ankles and stepping side to side for strengthening the muscles around his knees.  The problem with TheraBands is they come in a big roll that has to be cut to the right length and tied.  Each one wears out after ten days or so.  Now that we have the SKLZ Lateral Resistor and Pro Trainer, he can slip on the ankle wraps and sidestep for his physical therapy routine.

I compared the Amazon Basics model to others in the house and can easily see that this one either equal to or tougher than any others we have.

The length (32.5"") and the width of the bib top (9"") are the same as the others, but what I really like about this Now Designs model is the extra 6"" of width in the lower part of the apron.  This means that when I wrap the ties around my body to tie in the front, I can tuck my towel into the front, and there is some extra tie left to make a secure knot.

"Owning what may be the worst fingernails imaginable, I was very interested in experimenting with the Amope Pedi Perfect Electronic Nail Care System.  The entire apparatus, 7 inches in length, is comfortable to hold, and the  two-speed switch is easy to operate with the index finger.  Select  among the three inserts: File, Buff, or Polish, and easily snap it onto the handle.  Select Speed 1 or 2, and you're in business.  My thin nails are short, so it was difficult to file from under the nail because the filing insert is thicker than an emery board and not flexible.  However, I quickly filed as well as I could and moved on to polishing.  I was careful to polish quickly to avoid removing much nail, but the process did smooth out the roughest ridges.  The third, polishing, step quickly buffed the nails to a sheen, which from my experience with buffing, lasts several days.When I pulled this device out of the clear plastic shell, I was skeptical of the price, almost $40 at present.  I asked the next several people, family members and friends, that I encountered how much they felt it was worth to them; and they all said around $20.  I might pay that if the device came with some type of carrying case or even a bag that would contain all of the parts, which will probably be lost unless I supply something myself.This nail care system could be very valuable to someone with impaired ability to move hands and fingers, as it requires only a grasp, the three heads are very easy to insert, and it does its job quickly.  If it's difficult to reach ones toes, this device makes the reach a little easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1A4BWTASXI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IEGI1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1X1A4BWTASXI8","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The whole wheat pasta has twice as much dietary fiber, 4 grams/serving, vs. 2 grams/serving for the lentil pasta.  The protein content of the lentil pasta is about twice as high as that of the wheat pasta - 14 grams vs. 8 grams/serving.  The comparisons of the rest of the nutrients required to be listed, and the calorie count, are nearly identical per serving.In addition to the salad, I cooked one of the 12 ounce bags in the box using a ""cook-in-sauce"" method.  I made a sauce using extra water, then cooked the pasta right in the sauce in a covered pan.  At sea level, the lentil pasta takes a couple of minutes more than whole wheat pasta, whether cooked in sauce or in a pot of water.  The texture of the two pastas was quite similar, with the lentil product seeming a little more chewy and ""rougher"" than whole wheat pasta.Uddo's Red Lentil Pasta is a fine alternative to wheat pasta, much better than rice pasta, which I have found to be inedible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2L6ZUSGG52B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8SAJMM#wasThisHelpful","R1N2L6ZUSGG52B","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neutrogena body oil (light sesame formula) is a quick moisturizer to use right after a shower.  Simply squirt maybe a teaspoon of the product into your hands, rub them together, then quickly spread the oil onto your body.  Unless you use too much, your skin will not feel oily, and the fragrance of so little of the oil is hardly noticeable, a plus, in my opinion.  The secret is to use it sparingly. I have used this product for years, both the unscented and the lightly scented version.

"My husband chose this refrigerator to assist him in his small-scale home brewing hobby.  He plans to make lager, which has to sit at between 45 - 55 degrees F.  He reminds me to emphasize that he brews in 2 gallon batches, because a more typical 5 gallon container would not fit in this compact refrigerator.  He is sure that the refrigerator will maintain the desired temperature, but we will have to wait to see.  Right now, we are trying to fool some conifer seeds into believing that they are having a winter dormancy at just above freezing, something they would not experience here in San Francisco.  When the poor, confused seeds are ready to be planted, he will begin the beer project.  Ah, retirement!The refrigerator is in our garage.  I am often down there and never hear more than a very quiet hum and a slight pop.  The unit is attractive enough to keep in  a home bar or rec room.

"I'd never heard of K'Nex building sets even though I raised three kids and am well into enjoying two grandchildren.  I read on an Amazon.com discussion forum about some people being offered free sets to review, and, after checking the Amazon.com web page and the company's own webpage, I decided to buy a set for L, who just turned five.L loves building Lego sets, but I (and L's dad and mom) are a little disappointed in the Lego pre-determined sets that tell the builder what to build and how and that's it.  This 375 piece set is simply lots of pieces, wheels, connectors, rods, tires, and some suggested projects.  He and I built a very simple example of a milkshake together, but then he shoo'd me away because he had a plan.  On his own, he built a swingset with swings that go back and forth.  He urged me to push the swings while he pretended to be afraid because I was pushing him too high.  He also built a baseball diamond and revealed that his buddy has K'Nex pieces, but WON'T SHARE THEM.  L and his family live downstairs, and he has been up here many times to get in a little building time.  He even said that he's not sure, but he might like them better than Legos.The first day we were playing with the set, L managed to snap a tab off one of the pieces.  I called the customer-service line and told them what happened.  The woman promised to send a replacement, and a few days later an envelope with four of the pieces arrived in the mail.  Great service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327URRTZVHID9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CU65FOI#wasThisHelpful","R327URRTZVHID9","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, it's for carrying around or using in bed or a blanket ""tent,"" but not for lighting a room for activities.  The light gradually dims to dark in about thirty minutes, so it's perfect for chasing away any scary monsters that may be hiding in shadows when a kid wakes up in the middle of the night.  It seems solidly built, and it's cute as can be, but, more important, it gives a child a sense of ability to handle a situation by himself.  If he needs to walk to the bathroom, this light is strong enough to let him know what's around him.

"The Color Changers work well, with the cars responding to various temperatures very dependably.  The body shop itself takes adult assembly, at least for our five-year-old.  But, the set goes together easily and stays put together.  Having another Color Changers set on the deck already, we knew that it's not necessary to be extremely accurate about temperatures of water.  The concept itself is creative; Ramone drives into the paint booth as a pale yellow vehicle and emerges two-tone.  The kids can spray the water/paint onto the car as it sits in the paint booth.  The set is fun water play on the back deck, and a treat for our grandsons since we won't let them turn on the hose to play because of our California drought.  Our experience with the other set is that they shriek and have fun until they get soaked, about 20 minutes, and that's it until another day.The set comes with one character car, Ramone, but others are available for purchase (of course).  When I showed the set to our grandson before we constructed it, I said, ""You can use your other Color Changer cars with it, too.""  To which he replied, ""But they're not Cars cars.""  How early they learn.  But, the additional cars are a bit pricey, so the other cars with no facial expressions will have to suffice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WHWEH1WY13UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFYK#wasThisHelpful","R2WHWEH1WY13UI","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the Sargent Steam for over a year now.  I chose it because I am fascinated by the power of dry vapor cleaning, and because I wanted to replace my pressure steam iron that had died after being dropped too many times, and the Sargent offers an iron as an accessory.  This is an Italian-made machine that is marketed by a company in Utah, that has a website with a lot of valuable information and instruction and, it seems, just as much gushing and hyperbole.  My experience:The machine itself is easy to use.  Open the top and fill with tap water from an included bottle that has a spring-loaded top to prevent over-filling.  Two bottles full or so is about two quarts and this fills the machine.  Tighten the cap back onto the machine, plug it into an outlet, turn on both switches, attach the hose, and allow about ten minutes for the water inside to come to the proper steaming temperature according to a dial on the front of the machine.  Attach the desired nozzle or attachment and you're ready.  The volume of steam is controllable with two switches on the handle.  I usually turn on only one of the switches, which gives more than enough power steam to handle most jobs.The steam does an amazing job of blasting away greasy grime.  If you've ever watched the shopping channels demonstrate their wimpy little steam cleaners, you will be amazed at how much more pressure the Sargent emits.  The steam is most effective on greasy, but not burned-on dirt.  The top of my refrigerator sparkles, the bathroom tile is squeaky clean, and the track of the sliding door is clear of any dirt foolish enough to settle there.  Cleaning the inside of the oven requires both the power of the steam, plus the use of abrasive scrubbers, at least initially.My gripe is with the gadgets - brushes, pads, extension wands, - that are included with the machine.  They must add a few hundred dollars to the cost of the machine, and I find them to be pretty much useless.  They are very focused in direction and do not allow for flexibility to get into corners and awkward spots.  I almost always end up using the plain nozzle in one hand and a scrubber or appropriate pad in the other.  The Sargent company offers extras of all the little scrubbers, but I suggest starting with only what is included.  Many of the nylon scrubbing pads and the indispensible stainless steel scrubbers can be purchased in the grocery store and cut to size.The steamer must be cleaned out after every few uses, depending upon how high the mineral content is of your water.  This is probably the most awkward operation of all.  There's a cap on the bottom of the machine that is opened by using a wrench that is located in the screw-on cap that goes on the top of the machine.  So, you take the top off the machine, turn the machine over, and use this gadget to open the bottom.  Of course, while you're doing this, any water that's in the machine is running all over your arm and everywhere else.  Then when you get it empty, you must put the bottom back on, run more water in and shake the machine, then repeat the business of taking off the bottom cap with the top cap, having the water run all over while you're doing this, refilling again, opening again.  You really need a big laundry sink to do this.The pressure iron accessory that I bought is a dream to use.  Pressure irons work on several layers of cloth at a time, so the ironing gets done very quickly.Summary:  The Sargent Steam is a very powerful steamer, but it's not as user-friendly as it should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJA3K0OZUCY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001259SL4#wasThisHelpful","R3VJA3K0OZUCY9","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have thick, wavy hair which is cut about 2.5 inches long in a style that encourages curling.  I was pleased to get an opportunity to review a shampoo that is compounded to encourage the type style I want to achieve.  I've used it a few times and have found that it cleans well and does not leave my hair feeling dry and coarse, but rather soft and smooth.  It produces quite a bit of lather, so each time I've decreased the amount I pour into my hand.  I'm now down to a dime-size spot on my hand, which seems about right.  The fragrance is quite faint, which is a plus for me.  It rinses out easily now that I've adjusted the amount.

"EXPRESS LANE COOKING by Shawn Syphus draws up 5-ingredient shopping lists, and gives three variations for each of the shopping lists.  Oh, man, what can I do with this piece of steak?  This book has answers.  If one has a (very) well-stocked basic pantry, picking up the five ingredients listed including the steak or another meat, could produce a different dinner for each week of a month or so.  Poultry, red meat, fish and seafood, and vegetarian selections all feature this array of quick-to-fix recipes.  Plus, there are five desserts.  If saving time making dinner is at or near the top of a cook's list of priorities, this is your cookbook.In selecting this book, it would be very helpful if Amazon.com would add a display of the actual table of contents so that a potential buyer could decide whether the ingredients listed are what he or she might want to consume.  The publicity on the webpage states that the recipes use ""five whole-food ingredients.""  I question whether canned cheese sauce, Uncle Ben's risotto mix, and deli-case pulled pork are whole-food ingredients.  Prepared foods such as these tend to be high in sodium and fat.  Over half of the recipes feature cheese as one of the five ingredients.  All of the dessert recipes but one use cake mixes.

"My new Cuisinart stainless steel grill melting dome does exactly as the name implies.  When the chef (me) places it on, say, a hamburger or grilled vegetables over a slice or scoop of cheese, the dome concentrates the heat and smoke right onto the food allowing quick, even melting of cheese.  It should be used right before the food is ready to come off the grill.  The only downside is that it is 9"" in diameter so it can be used only on small amounts of food at one time.  Two hamburgers pushed close together would become two lovely cheeseburgers.I started using a similar aluminum model after watching a chef in a restaurant pop a pan lid over eggs that were cooking on the griddle to finish them quickly.  I usually give the inside of the cover a quick rinse with water if I want to steam something a little.  In my kitchen the dome sits on top of the stove all of the time and is an indispensible tool I use almost every day.  The Cuisinart stainless steel model is MUCH easier to clean than the aluminum one.  It has a metal handle which doesn't get very hot on top of the stove in a quick use, but it becomes very hot in my covered barbecue.  Use a hot pad to pick up the dome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OT0DAQD496OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WEZY#wasThisHelpful","R3OT0DAQD496OT","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After over forty years of owning some typically inexpensive baking pans, a year or so ago, I started replacing them with better-quality, heavier-weight pans.  I have another 8"" x 8"" pan of similar grade to compare this new KitchenAid Professional Grade nonstick pan.  Both pans have similar folded corners and are aluminized steel.  However the KitchenAid model weighs a few ounces more, and the KitchenAid is free of some rough edges that the other one has..  The finish is lustrous and smooth inside and out, with folded metal corners.  The inside of the pan is coated with a glossy non-stick surface that was perfect after I scraped bits of packaging adhesive off with my thumbnail.  There is a slight flare to the sides of the pan, as another reviewer noted, but virtually every other rectangular and square baking pan that I own has a similar flared design.  The heavier weight of the baking pans ensures heat retention that can withstand variations in oven temperature as the oven re-heats or when the oven door is opened.  I find that with the heavier pans, the times given in my recipes are very close to the actual baking time required, at least at sea level.  The KitchenAid pan feels similar in gauge to the pans I used at my job as a school cook,  baking brownies for 400 kids.Okay, so to test the pan, I baked cornbread without any greasing of the pan.  As soon as the timer chimed, at the lowest time given in the recipe, I tested the product with a toothpick and found it to be ready.  I let it sit on a cooling rack for ten minutes then flipped the cornbread out and then back onto another plate so the top shows.  The cornbread came out perfectly, with a little residue, but no chunks, left in the pan.  This residue is normal.  This was an experiment, and it worked.  However, I almost always use either a baking spray product or solid shortening or butter to grease pans; sometimes I also use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan only and then grease the paper, especially for low-fat recipes.  When the pan cooled, I put water and a little liquid dish detergent in and left it to soak, and it washed up by hand beautifully.  Although the pan probably will not be ruined in the dishwasher,  the glossy finish and the pan will last longer with a simple hand washing.This quality bakeware is a joy to use.  Anyone who is using battered and beaten thin aluminum pans, as I was, should try one professional weight pan.  What a treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUCEM2V6UITN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGDN5Q6#wasThisHelpful","RSUCEM2V6UITN","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No ironing; it just went right back onto the table.This DII damask, wine colored tablecloth is a bit heavier in weight than others I own, with just a bit of sheen.  The slightly heavier weight gives it a rich look and cuts down on the slippery nature of polyester tablecloths.  However, slippery is not a problem.  Just put down some plates and forks, or a centerpiece,  and the problem is solved.  The hems are nicely sewn, and there are no loose threads.  I really like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQVTWD4XYT2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHU3IBS#wasThisHelpful","R3GQVTWD4XYT2Q","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dyson AM09 Fan Heater is the latest, most advanced model of the sleek, bladeless air-movers from this innovative company.  I am very excited to have an opportunity to use and review this product, because the odd design of our old house creates some dead air zones that require mechanically moving some air, heated or not, a good part of the year.  Also, we often don't want to turn on our furnace and heat the entire house to use one room on a chilly day.  In keeping with that thrifty nature, I looked for the wattage usage on the machine itself and on all of the packaging and instruction book and couldn't find any information.  Naturally, wattage use will vary with the fan speed and with the heat setting, but I was curious about a range.I won't go into detail about each of the features of the fan heater, because they are right there on Amazon.com's website.  The heating function is especially welcome.  The Jet Focus control of the heated area allows focused heat toward my husband while he practices the piano, for example, but, without moving the device, the diffused mode warms the entire room when more people are in the room.  I set the temperature about 10 degrees above the actual room temperature, and within five minutes the entire 18' x 10' room with 11' ceilings felt comfortably warmer in all corners. Even on fan setting 10, the warm air wafted around the room without disturbing curtains and papers on the table at about its height.  Very nice.  The fan heater can be set to oscillate, but it really wasn't necessary to warm the entire room.  At setting 10, I could hear a slight whooshing sound, but at a perfectly reasonable speed 6, there was almost no sound.  The casing inside and out was warm, but not blistering hot.All of the advertising for the AM09 shows it sitting on the floor, sometimes with a baby a few feet away from it.  I would not feel comfortable with such an arrangement, despite the tipping turn-off feature.  If a couple of kids rushed by it with arms extended, or if a pet ran by, the fan heater would be on its side.  It is stable on its base, but could easily be knocked over.  Also, the magnet at the top of the fan heater and the remote must be somewhat carefully aligned to keep the remote in place.  If you misplace the little remote, your manual operation option is to turn it on or off.The price of the unit has been mentioned in several reviews.  All high-end appliances receive comments like this, but perception of value is individual.  Some might be willing to pay for the features, the style, and even the name; and some would not.  That should not detract from the machine itself.  This fan heater is attractive, efficient, and lives up to its publicity.  Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA20PRKYETV9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLKEPA#wasThisHelpful","RA20PRKYETV9O","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My usual cup of espresso is very dark with almost a bite.  The Yrgacheffee blend is lighter, smoother, and more herbal than I am accustomed to.  Coffee, like any other food, is in the mouth of the beholder.  There are people who will discover that they love this blend.  The capsule produced a rich, strong drink with very nice crema.The Cap'Mundo capsule popped easily into our Nespresso machine, and required only the normal amount of pressure on the lever to begin the brewing process.  I am an avid recycler, so it is frustrating that these capsules cannot be easily sent for recycling as the Nespresso brand capsules can.

"Click, click, and the new Dyson V6 Absolute Cordless Vacuum was assembled.  The battery was charged, so I tested it where I plan to use it most, the kitchen floor.  The motor is relatively quiet, and the machine is relatively light-weight (around 5 lb).  To operate the vacuum, hold the power tab against the handle and go.  Holding the tab in is not a burden, as it has almost no resistance to touch and is placed very conveniently.  The direct-drive cleaner head picked up debris like pieces of cereal and bits of cardboard with ease and with no kick-back, and it picked up fine dust as well.  The suction seemed sufficient to do the job.  I also like to vacuum the crumbs off my countertops.  The small profile of the battery and handle and the angle possible with the included combination tool allowed me to do this very easily.  I had planned to purchase the optional extension hose to assist with this job, but that probably will be unnecessary.  I used the combination tool to reach some tight spaces, and the job was finished.  There was no need to use the ""max"" speed.I moved to the dining room which is also the path from the kitchen to the rest of the house, and gave a quick touch-up to the path of the plush carpet.  The pick-up was fine, maybe not as aggressive as my big and old Dyson DC07, but the place looked clean.Now, to explain the use of the word ""relatively"" in the first two paragraphs:  About a year ago, my electric broom gave out, and I searched for a corded machine that would clean both countertops and floors.  The heavily advertised product I bought is similar in appearance to the Dyson V6 Absolute, but it is larger.  And heavier (about 8.5 lb., 3 lb. heavier than the V6 Absolute).  Weight is an issue in a vacuum like this, because as you vacuum the floor, your arm supports most of the weight of the vacuum.  I am not particularly weak, but the downward pull of the larger machine is very tiring on my arm.  The motor head of the other machine kicks crumbs around on the bare floor.  Those two features and a few lesser ones make me realize how silly I was to insist upon a corded vacuum, and that my attempt to save money was less than successful.It's an easy task to walk over to the trash can and open the little trap door to release the picked-up dirt.  I haven't cleaned the filter yet, but it simply lifts out and can be rinsed and allowed to air dry.The V6 Absolute model is similar in basics to the V6 Motorhead; the additional $125 or so for the Absolute is charged for additional features and accessories.  Consumers should consider the value they will get from these accessories before choosing between models.On the Absolute is a HEPA filter to catch the tiniest particles of dust and allergens that the standard filter doesn't trap.  This HEPA filter sits at the back of the handle and is easy to remove to rinse, along with the other standard filter.  It is easy to remove, but it never FELL off as other reviewers mentioned; the door must have been re-designed to prevent that fault.  If one is very sensitive to dust, this might be worth the expenditure.The most notable accessory included with the Absolute is the new soft roller cleaner head for hard floors.  This snaps onto the vacuum in place of the motor head and cleans the floor with a combination of velour rollers and very soft brushes.  It is EXTREMELY effective in vacuuming and almost polishing the bare floor.  It may be very beneficial to cleaning high-gloss floors, where every particle of dust could show.  It is the same length (10"") as the motorhead, but it is attached to its connection with a flexible hose, which allows it to bend into slightly tighter spaces.The mini-motorized tool, only 5.75"" long, is designed to pick up pet hair from upholstery and more.  I don't have pets, but I was able to vacuum off little goose-down pinfeathers that were clinging to a couch.  The brushes are firm, but soft, so I felt comfortable using it on upholstery.  This could be my answer to getting into the tight corners of the floor where no upright vacuum could ever reach.Another handy accessory is the mini dusting tool.  I purchased a larger version of this tool years ago and use it every time I vacuum, on lampshades and the grills that cover some stereo equipment.  This smaller version will have similar uses and could reach into some tight spaces.Kudos to the Dyson company for packing the vacuum into its carton with recyclable cardboard instead of Styrofoam..","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LYNTFZDW1DZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJPKA#wasThisHelpful","R1LYNTFZDW1DZW","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm on my third iPod Touch, always taking it traveling, always charging it with Belkin plug-in chargers.  Most of my charging cables have been Belkin products also, and they've never frayed, cracked, or failed in any way.  The ""mixit"" 1.2 meter or 4 foot cable I received to review has a couple of features that are different from the others.  First feature is the length.  I don't know why Apple makes those puny 3' charge/sync cords, which require the user to be right next to an electrical outlet or computer.  Four feet is a definite improvement, although I still prefer the 6 foot cords I've bought.  Second feature is the cool cable look.  The cord looks like one of the locking cables that people put on their laptops to secure them to a chair in a coffee shop to prevent a grab theft.  I don't know and doubt if the actual working cables inside this braided plastic sheath are any different, but the multi-shade sheath appears to be actually braided, and, if so, would be stronger than a thin plastic coating.

"In the last decade or so, beer has become a beverage to be discussed and savored, in addition to its traditional function as something to drink while socializing or watching a sporting event.  THE BEER WENCH'S GUIDE TO BEER, by Ashley Routson, can serve as a manual for savoring and understanding beer.  It is a fun and informative manual that avoids becoming too technical or pretentious.So, what are the different styles of beers?  Where did they originate, and why?  There are nine separate chapters on many of the popular brews, from pale lagers to very bold ales and beyond.  How are they made?  This aspect of beer is handled more briefly but with enough detail to provide an understanding.  This is not a manual for making beer.  Finally, enjoying beer, which is what this book is really about.  Choosing beer styles to pair with various foods:  There are suggestions to get started.  After trying a few suggested pairings, we can branch out and can begin to recognize what works together and what doesn't.  We can start cooking with beer.  There is a sampling of recipes submitted by brewers.  I have my eye on those Blackout Stout Chocolate Cupcakes.  Finally, there's a section on beer cocktails.  Those are for you to try; I'm not quite ready for these.

"It looks like many other flat graters, like a paddle with a handle and two widths of grating blades, ribbons, and coarse shreds.  You can hold it with one hand and grate a little cheese or chocolate onto another part of the recipe.  An example would be some Parmesan cheese onto pasta.  On the underside of the handle is the button that activates the feature that makes this Joseph Joseph grater unique.  Push the button and rotate the handle to put it at a 90 degree angle to the grater.  Then set it onto a board or plate, where the angle at the end of the handle creates a way to stand the grater up,  You have to hold onto the grater with one hand, so it's still a two-hand operation, but with the grater propped in this way, you can take on some bigger jobs that can't be completed in a few seconds.  You now shred a whole apple (not the core, of course), or enough cheddar or similar firm cheese for tacos or to top onion soup.  The propped-up grater is quite stable, thanks to the grippy material at the end of the handle and along the opposite edge of the grater itself. I'm finding it very easy to use, easy to wash in the dishwasher, and easy to store when it's flat.  There's a durable plastic cover that slides on to cover the sharp grater.  You can also grate directly onto this cover, and supposedly measure how much grated food collects.  The measurement is wildly inaccurate, but it's fine for an estimate of how much you've grated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D1NL5SLWZ5WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R86D4PM#wasThisHelpful","R1D1NL5SLWZ5WF","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was fun reminiscing about past work assignments where we would be stationed far from home and where there were many co-workers from British Commonwealth countries.  Tea was always served in proper china cups, and the sugar and the milk pitcher were carried to the table on a little tray.  Even those ladies used teabags most of the time, so my family and I tested Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea in complete confidence that we were using authentic procedure.  After allowing the bags to steep in the just-boiled water for a few minutes, we poured and sipped, at first with no milk.  The outstanding quality to me was that the tea was very smooth and flavorful, and there was no hint of the acrid bitterness that I have experienced when drinking typical teas of the brands I grew up with in the United States; I'll not mention any brands.  So I added a little milk and I felt I was back having an afternoon cup with my fellow wives of construction employees in far-off places.

"Phyto 5 Extreme Cream is intended for dry, needy skin.  I've been applying this cream to my face twice a day, as instructed on the Amazon.com website, and my average-to-dry face has felt dryer than it has in the years I've been using a product that I buy in a big jar for around $10.  In fact, today, when I'm not wearing make-up, my face felt too dry, so I rubbed on some of the old stuff over the Phyto 5.  The dry vs hydrated feeling is purely subjective; others may love the soft, not moist effect.  I did discover that it is a mistake to use more than a tiny amount of the Phyto 5 or it leaves a whitish film that I dissipated by spreading the cream over my neck and collarbone.

"The name ""Ritz"" on a towel means, to me, a tough workhorse kitchen tool that will take on all the drying and wiping tasks I demand of it, and, on its way to the laundry, maybe wipe up a spill on the floor.  That towel will happily survive a hot-water wash, maybe with bleach, and return to the kitchen, challenging me to work it harder.  I have at least six Ritz kitchen towels in their signature plaid that are around ten years old, and still going strong.  My Ritz potholders have survived similar treatment and get used all through every day.  The Ritz name, partnered with All-Clad, another serious cook's favorite, I thought would mean a product that could take the heat in the kitchen.  The towel I took out of the packaging had a couple of white thread pulls from the reverse white side pulled through to the tan decorative side before any use.  I washed it before using it, as directed, in cold water, and it did an admirable job wiping some glassware and plastic items that didn't get dry in the dishwasher.  It does look great hanging in the kitchen.  But if a couple of people wipe their hands on it, I want to wash it in hot water before I use it on dishes again.

"We have a long, narrow row house; the DSL connection enters at the front of the house.  Near  what used to be the rear end of the house, about 60' away, we have a second router/modem connected to the first one by CAT6 cable in the attic.  behind that there are three bedrooms stacked upon each other, and, formerly, there was no dependable internet connection in the farthest, first-floor bedroom.  The Linksys AC1200 Amplify Dual Band Range Extender was delivered today, and, within twenty minutes or so, there was a decent signal both in that room and in our backyard, right behind that room.  The signal shows on my iPod touch as being strong, but the speed drops off slightly.  Here is our download speed breakdown, according to speedtest.net:  At first router about 13mbps.  At the second router, about 5.85mbps.  At the farthest bedroom, with the Linksys AC1200 connected, about 5mbps.Placement and installation of the new range extender was easy.  First, we tried to connect to the Linksys website listed in the instructions, but received an error message.  Next, we tried the Linksys main website, doing a search with the model number, and received some help, but not the connection we'd hoped for.  Finally, we plugged in the extender to an electrical outlet that seemed logical, and moved on to step 3 in the Quick Start booklet, connected to the website given, and, seeing the extender show up as an option on our Kindle Fire, and we were in business.We have not, and probably never will, stream music to a wireless device with this extender, but the feature of being able to use the outlet that is covered is a plus, with limited outlets in that room.  So, the extender extends, and all's right with the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKO4Y8TN27L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20YA#wasThisHelpful","RXKO4Y8TN27L4","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I served all four varieties of Chef's Cut Real Steak Jerky on a tray to a group of friends who came over to watch a Giants game.  The Giants lost, but the jerky was a real winner!  I've eaten the jerky that is sold on a rack near the cash register in a drugstore.  This is a whole different product.  We noticed right away that it is sliced slightly thicker, which gives it a nice mouth feel.  It is more flexible and chewy, more like eating meat, not cardboard.  Because it tastes more meaty, it does not seem as salty as drugstore jerky.  Each of the four varieties had distinctive flavoring, and our friends had personal favorites among the four in the variety pack.  I particularly liked the chicken and turkey varieties, but the beef varieties had some real fans among us also.  This is a premium product, and we very much appreciate this opportunity to taste and review it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7DQKLU16BX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGWPUQA#wasThisHelpful","R3D7DQKLU16BX5","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Westinghouse Iron, 5 oz. tank, listed as ""good.""  And it is good.  It does some jobs my $300 steam pressure iron cannot do, and I don't have to wait 10 - 15 minutes for the steam boiler to heat up.  This is the iron that quickly heats up enough water to steam press an outfit when you realize that you really cannot face colleagues looking so wrinkled, or when you want to dry iron on a decal or patch or a piece of Velcro.  The lightweight Westinghouse iron steams vertically, so you just pull on the lapel or skirt of a hanging garment to stretch it a bit, then blast it with a bit of steam.  Nice.  This iron weighs only about 1.5 lb, without water, and the lovely 8.5 foot cord swivels around on a ball bearing.  It has the control properly placed under the handle so that the thermostat is close to the soleplate.  This gives more accurate temperature control, even if it is a little more difficult to turn the dial.  The iron has automatic shut-off, which I find annoying, but which probably has prevented many house fires.  I recommend this iron as a second iron for a serious, committed ironer (there are a few left in the world), and as a first and only iron for a modern person who performs mostly light ironing and lets no-iron fabrics take care of the rest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PC36JTL9QGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV70MB6#wasThisHelpful","R32PC36JTL9QGS","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed about Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean was the smell.  Unless you put your nose right to the open bottle, there isn't one.  I did side-by-side comparisons with two other products that I use regularly.  The Quick-n-Brite I use in my kitchen, simply was not at all effective on the smoky, greasy exterior of our stainless steel gas barbecue, so that left the Scotts and the Krud Kutter solution, my go-to product for greasy clean-ups.  I sprayed both onto the metal, which was a warm from the sun, waited a few minutes, then wiped with microfiber clothes.  The results were pretty even.  The softer grease wiped right off, and with a little rubbing, so did the more crusty parts.  On a patch of once-reddish, now green bricks, the Scotts Outdoor Cleaner bubbled and foamed, and the green wiped right off the smooth bricks.  The Krud Kutter took slightly more rubbing, but it also worked.  Neither product was very effective on the algae-covered redwood fence board I tried to clean, even with a scrub brush.The Scotts Outdoor Cleaner is very effective on the types of surfaces it claims to clean, the label says that it is safe for plants and grass, and it is essentially odorless.  This formulation comes in an ergonomic spray bottle that offers spray and stream options, and it is ready to use, without having to measure and make a solution with water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFHYM52N08U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZVRM8#wasThisHelpful","R3PFHYM52N08U1","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a home/rental property owner, I try do most of the small repairs myself.  The wrenches in this Crescent combination wrench set will probably not get the hard use at our houses that they will in a car repair place, but I've applied some real torque to one of them, loosening a nut on a rusted planter box somewhat easily, and I'm enjoying the ease of being able to loosen and tighten nuts without having to move the appliance they're attached to.  Experiment #2 was tightening the nuts on the back of my dryer to cut down on the rattling.  Usually I have to pull the dryer away from the wall in its little slot.  Now I was able to reach behind and tighten up what needs to be taken care of.  I like to do the same thing on the washer, but it is so heavy that I need a second person to help get the thing away from the wall.  Again, I was able to tighten the nuts by simply reaching behind.  It's so easy to do with the open-ended side of the wrenches in spots that are really too tight even for my socket wrench.  Most of the jobs I do involve inches, not millimeters, so I will purchase another set, while my spouse is eyeing the metric set for his beloved sports car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPTQDJR9N434/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L895JO#wasThisHelpful","R3MPTQDJR9N434","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While waiting for my shipment of Nia 24 Neck Sculpting Complex to arrive, I read the review of a fellow Vine reviewer describing a painful reaction to this cream.  So, when my sample arrived, I tried it in the crook of my arm for a couple of days before applying it to my neck.  There was no adverse reaction, so I got down to business of transforming my slightly crepe-y neck back to its condition in my golden youth.The cream is a dense formulation with a slight herbal aroma and a very slight alcohol-like scent.  All the scents dissipate when I apply the cream.  It doesn't take much; the jar will last a long time.  In the six days I've been using the cream, I noticed nothing the first couple of days.  Since then, I've felt a slight tightness in the area, which I'm taking as a good sign.  There is no discomfort.I believe this cream is working, but it will take several more weeks before I can declare definitive success.  Of course, for this treatment to be successful long-term, one must keep buying more of this cream.  And, that's why I took off one star - the cost of the treatment.  But, the worth of expenditures is a personal decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RCOBGFBMKPIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MP1859A#wasThisHelpful","R1RCOBGFBMKPIT","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hitachi cordless driver drill includes a few helpful features that another small drill I own does not have.  First, the kit comes with a second battery.  Although Lithium-Ion batteries last a long time on a full charge, when they do go out, they drop off rapidly, so it's great to have a second fully charged one ready for an extended job.  Second, it is really helpful to have a clutch on a small driver drill when you're driving screws in a tight space barely big enough to get fingers near, a clutch can insure consistent torque and may prevent over-driving a screw when you can't really see what you're doing, even with the help of the convenient included work light (which should be placed closer to the top of the handle so it shines directly onto the workpiece).  I found myself up on a ladder attaching some trim high over my head on our back fence.  I probably would have pushed too hard and maybe dropped the screw without the consistent torque.  This project brings up the third helpful feature.  It's that included belt loop.  When last I tried a project along this fence, I dropped my hand clippers over to the neighboring property.  I could hang this driver drill onto a hook each time I wanted to make an adjustment.  The small size (6.75"" length, plus whatever bit you add) and light weight (just under 2.5 lb including the battery), make this a great option for repairs and home projects.  Its small diameter allowed me to reattach a strip of trim to a cabinet with a thin screw that is only about an inch above the floor.  When I originally attached this trim, I had to use a multi-tool (Dremel) which involved a cord, and was quite inconvenient.The kit comes with a carrying case, the second battery and charger, and a set of bits, which are all enclosed in a decent carrying case with room for some drill bits (not included).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYBCMPPFZC4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1WODJM#wasThisHelpful","R2VYBCMPPFZC4P","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earrings, depicting the Celtic Tree of Life, have an elegant, silky feel.  The wire branches of the tree intertwine, as do the roots.  The border of the earring is composed of tiny balls within two circles, and each sphere is accented by dark oxidation in the background. At the center of each tree is a gray-purple adventurine stone about 1/16"" across, and the stone is set in a four-prong mounting as the stone in a ring would be.The feature of these earrings that distinguishes them from other earrings in this price range is the careful finishing.  There are no rough spots anywhere, including where the elements of the design are joined together.  The earrings have the appearance of fine jewelry.  The size of the circles is about the same as a nickel, and the top of the loop that holds the circle onto the wire falls just below my earlobe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MV7JQ0O5VLAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ87TI#wasThisHelpful","R3MV7JQ0O5VLAB","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Commercially prepared sauces in jars will probably never be as good as Mama's or Luigi's at the café down the street, but they can be really useful in preparing a healthy meal on the fly, when the alternative is fast food.  That is exactly the situation I imagined when I prepared a quick meal of a jar of Barilla Roasted Garlic Pasta Sauce, 1/2 pound of spaghetti, and a package of pre-cooked Italian sausage.  Making a quick salad from a bag of pre-washed greens completed a decent dinner in less time than I could have ordered take-out or waited for delivery.The sauce is rather mild for my taste, but a little salt and a shake of red pepper on my portion fixed that.  There are lots of pieces of roasted garlic in the sauce, and the mild flavor of roasted garlic is quite noticeable.  As I said, it's not homemade, but it's good.The Spicy Marinara is even better, to my taste.  It has lots of chunks of ingredients and a snappy chile bite that might be a bit too much for a picky child.  This variety does not need any doctoring to sauce pasta, polenta, or a sauté of vegetables and sausages.Both varieties are low calorie and very low in fat.  I will, from now on, keep a few jars of Barilla sauces in my ""last-minute dinner"" arsenal.

"We live in a somewhat gritty urban neighborhood; surveillance of the street right before we installed this system may have identified the criminals who broke into a parked car in broad daylight outside my house last week.  We found that set-up was reasonably easy, although the system kept jumping to another wireless network than the one we specified on my mobile device.  We called customer service, and were surprised and delighted with the attentive and patient assistance we received from ""Andy"".  He helped us to re-set the system a couple of times, to match one of the two networks we have in our home.  It's good that we learned to do this, because we have had several notifications that the monitor is not responding, and we have had to go through the process repeatedly.Setting up the cameras is easy if there is a plug near the site where you want the camera.  We are going to have a cleaner installation when we have a plug installed a little closer to our porch, but for now, we've run the thin wire through a window and under some molding a total distance of about eight feet.  The cameras come with devices to connect to a building with various angles permitted.  The camera comes with a thin cord plus extension cord.  Why, we wonder, are there right-angle connections between these two cords?  A much smoother connection could be made with either one long cord or another type of connection between the two cords.  As an experiment, we took the second camera to our rental across the street, maybe 100 feet, and were able to get a signal, although we don't plan to put a permanent installation there.  The video transmitted from the cameras is quite high quality, even with all the shadows from street trees that we have.  This system will be a very satisfactory set-up for us, as soon as we can get the signal to be consistent without having to re-set it so often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM75UDTAWEFDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ1XXA4#wasThisHelpful","RM75UDTAWEFDO","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hefty Slider Storage Bags claim to have a stronger seal than Ziploc bags, and I certainly wouldn't argue with that claim. I've never been able to get Ziploc bags to seal and always use a clip to hold them shut.  The Hefty sliders do close quite securely and will continue to seal for a few uses, but over time, or if the grip edge gets greasy, the grip just fails.I find the quart size bag best for packing snacks to take kids to the playground, or for a day hike.  They will keep a sandwich fresh, and they will securely transport a handful of fruit.  They are great for keeping sewing supplies dust free  and organized, and for transporting items one wants to keep clean while doing a messy job.  For example, I like to put masking tape in a Hefty Slider bag before I throw it in with my paint supplies.  So long as the bag is not overstuffed, they live up to the claims on the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFRBKLKUQT29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2XFRBKLKUQT29","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Space is at a premium in our house, and our broom doesn't have a closet to hide in, so we've always kept it in a little space between the refrigerator and the end of the cabinets.  Because the orientation of the hanging loop on the broom itself, hanging on a hook attached to the cabinet has never quite worked.  The Command Broom Gripper grabs the broom below the hook, so the problem is solved; the broom now lies flat and fits into the space.Installation is simple enough:  Clean the surface with alcohol.  Remove the adhesive from one side of the included strips and stick to the hook.  Remove the liner from the ""business"" side of the strips and press the Gripper in place for 30 seconds.  Let the adhesive set for an hour, then it's good to go. There are instructions for removal, which with other Command products, I've found to be simple and neat.Push the broom into the gripper to secure, and pull on the broom to release it.

"The window we like to keep open most of the time is on the west side of our house and catches the wind that roars in from the Pacific most afternoons.  The room closest to this window is our bedroom, which has always been in need of daily attention to the layer of dust that blew in.  I saw the roll of PollenTec Clean Air Window Screen discussed elsewhere and ordered it from Amazon.com.  We opted to have a new screen made for this window rather than retrofit the crumbling old one.  Popped that screen into the window and immediately noticed that it was slightly darker in the room.  Slightly.  After a few days I don't notice it anymore.  There is still a breeze blowing in, bringing the fresh air to the odd back part of our very old house.  I noticed the next morning that there was still a very light mist of dust on the windowsill and the nearby furniture.  Then, I realized that for the first time in weeks my eyes were not itching!  My spouse is so happy that he is not fighting with the avocado tree in the neighbor's yard, which is in bloom right now.  This is great.  We have lots of Pollentec screen left, so I'm going to attempt to make a small screen for the other window on that side of the house.After I bought the Pollentec, I received an email from Paul Honnen, owner of Pollentec, asking me to write a review here.  So, I emailed him back pointing out that there were no cleaning instructions with the roll of screen or on their website.

"Until the last year or so I thought people who talked about their allergies were hypochondriacs or malingerers.  That was then.  More recently, particularly in the house, I have felt itchy eyes, congestion, and other symptoms that I had scoffed at.  I blamed it on cosmetics, my grandkids' colds, not wishing to brand myself with the scarlet ""A"" for allergies.  An always-open window brought in enough dust to require daily attention, which it didn't always receive.  So, when I was offered an opportunity to review the Febreze HEPA-Type Tower Air Purifier, I vacuumed, dusted, put the curtains into the dryer to de-dust - everything I could think of to get ready for the arrival.The tower itself is easy to set up.  Remove the covers from the filters, pop in a Febreze fragrance cartridge, and plug in.  The fragrance at the highest level was a bit too much for us, but turning the knob to just below half-strength gave us a hint of fragrance.  The cleaning level knob offers three levels, and of course we started it at level III, eager to get moving.  We turned it down to II to quiet the tower while we slept, and I sort of forgot about the thing.  Then, this morning, as I was putting on make-up, I realized  MY EYES DID NOT ITCH.  Absolutely amazing.  This afternoon, when the light shined through the window just right, I gave the curtain a good shake, and the smaller-than-usual amount of dust that I could see in the light started moving toward the tower.I'm convinced.  Allergies are real, and I have some.  Thanks to this efficient air purifier, my sleep is not going to be interrupted by sneezing and dry eyes.

"I have, over the years, watched in awe demonstrations of automatic embroidery machines, but had never actually used one.  As the Brother PE 525 Embroidery Machine is an entry-level machine, I am relaying my learning experience, hoping that others will be able to assess which machine to buy.  The machine is a snap to set up; essentially you plug it in, wind the bobbin (there is one pre-wound bobbin included), thread the machine, snap fabric and backing onto the machine, pick a design, and you're embroidering!Now, step-by-step:  There is a quick-start guide included, but I found the more detailed Operation Manual (two, actually, one in English and one in Spanish) to be more suited to a rank beginner.  Attach the power cord and turn the machine on, and spend a few minutes surfing the little screen for various features, included patterns and fonts, then get to the business of winding the bobbin.  First, I learned that the bobbins are a standard-size, available wherever sewing supplies are sold.  They are usually wound in white thread because the embroidery patterns cover both the back and front of the fabric; the bobbin thread does not show through on the right side of the pattern.  The books have a diagram for threading and for bobbin winding, and there are numbers and arrows printed on the machine itself.  The process is very much like winding a bobbin for a sewing machine.Second, thread the machine.  This is pretty straightforward, much like a sewing machine, except for the self-threading needle.  Wow.  I love this!  I re-did this part of the process numerous times, because this is something that is very difficult for me on my sewing machine.For practice, I used scraps of old fabric from the rag bag that I attached with spray glue to a purchased piece of interfacing.  The work area and the included patterns are 4"" x 4"", not a big area, but by moving the hoop and adding another pattern or repeating the same pattern, the total design could be much larger.  Choose a pattern, and the machine tells which color to thread onto the machine.  It quickly takes care of business, making all of its stitches, then either pauses and moves to another area that uses the same color or it stops and tells you to thread in another color.  After the process is complete, all you need to do is remove the fabric from the hoop and clip the threads with the (included) embroidery scissors.  I also experimented with a couple of the included fonts.  You simply choose the font, choose the size (large, medium, or small), and choose the letters for your word on the touchscreen.  All the stitching I did, using the included thread and bobbin and then using some of my own threads turned out perfectly.  I will purchase the recommended polyester thread for any ""real"" projects.The seventy included designs are mostly very traditional.  There are an unlimited number of designs available for purchase from Brother's own iEmbroidery site and from others.  It is also possible to use an existing .png design file by converting it with software to a .pes file compatible with the Brother machines.  If I understand the manual correctly, these functions can only be done with a PC, not an Apple computer, at this time.  However, watch for software updates, which can be accessed with the included USB cable.I have found the Brother PE 525 to be extremely user friendly and I am thrilled to be able to add this skill to my projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQNKMFYYV6OHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW39OCC#wasThisHelpful","RQNKMFYYV6OHQ","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a little difficult to get 4-year-old L. to try these, because he smelled the bottle as I was counting out a recommended dosage of four gummies.  The bottle has a familiar (fish oil?) ""vitamin"" smell that is not noticeable once the individual gummies are away from the bottle.  He and I both tasted them (he agreed to try one), and found them to taste like not-to-sweet candy.  Soon after, I noticed an oily taste in my mouth, which L. did not mention.  His present vitamin is two slightly larger bears, containing half the sugar of four of these gummies.  These have the omega 3 added, which is fine, but otherwise the formulation is quite similar.I am not a scientist and am not qualified to analyze the composition of supplements.  A complete multi-vitamin is probably a good idea, especially for kids whose diet seemingly consists of a few items.  So, the best vitamin is the one the child will take.

"There's a spot on my upper back that I can't reach.  The spot has always been dry and itchy, and I've been very diligent about rubbing on my usual lotion with a device - a sponge on a handle.  Sometimes by mid-day, even with the lotion, my back would be itchy, and if time and circumstances allowed, I would put on moisturizer mid-day.  But it was always itchy.Amazon.com sent me a free sample of Curel Ultra Healing Lotion to review, which I started using last week in the morning after my shower.  Yesterday, it occurred to me that my back is no longer itching.  I've been using it once a day and loving the results.  Another plus feature is that it has no discernible scent.  The lotion is not at all greasy, and it only takes a very small amount to be effective.

"We connected this device (HDMI to 2x VGA Splitter Dongle) to a laptop, and then connected it to two monitors.  In our trial, the splitter dongle performed perfectly well, enabling both monitors to display the materials.  The connection was trouble free.  Whether this is worth $53, with the short use span of equipment in an office environment is a decision each office would have to make.  What I hope to do with this splitter is connect it to two somewhat older projectors that my organization uses at monthly meetings.  Many of the attendees have limited English abilities, and we now use verbal translation with earbuds.  We would like to have our translator type the important points onto a laptop and project it to the large room and cut down on the background conversation among the attendees as they explain a translation to each other.  I haven't been able to test this ability yet, as we haven't had a meeting during the timespan I am required to meet to test this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFM7WE266F55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOXMCCO#wasThisHelpful","RWFM7WE266F55","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My four-year-old grandson was beside himself with excitement when the Hot Wheels Color Shifters Color Splash Science Lab arrived.  He has another set that he loves, even if it is a little ragged from repeated uses.With a little help from his mom, he quickly assembled the parts.  All snapped together securely.  Then we sat and decided where the stickers should be placed.  Next, out onto the deck with some hot and cold water.  All of the action works exactly as described on the box, and we were able to use the cars from the old set as well.  The waterfall, in particular, is a lot of fun. Yes, the launched cars sometimes fly over the mark, but that doesn't seem to bother him or his little brother.This is an inexpensive toy and probably will not last as long as other toy investments that cost more.  But for the price of a couple of hot dogs at the zoo, children will have months of fun with this set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZBRLYB0YD6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1Q5WYO#wasThisHelpful","R1OZBRLYB0YD6P","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a couple of qualifiers for people who might choose Puroast Espresso Nespresso Capsules:  (1) they must own a Nespresso machine that uses OriginaLine capsules; and (2) they want a low-acid coffee.  Plus, they must be willing to pay about twice as much for these capsules as the Nespresso brand capsules.Okay, we had the big taste test today.  After warming the machine and two cups, I made, in quick succession, a cup of the Puroast Amore Italiano, and a cup of Nespresso Volluto, described as ""sweet and light.""  The Puroast cup was very smooth, light, and mellow.  The Nespresso, even though only Intensity 4, had that punchy bite that I associate with espresso.  There was a huge difference in taste.The capsules appeared to be exactly the same size, and I had no trouble using either one.  This is a fine product for people who do not like the slightly bitter tang of espresso.

"I've been using Cetaphil cleanser on my face for several years, after becoming alarmed at how dry my skin felt after using even mild bar soaps, so I was curious to see how Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser would compare.  The answer:  very favorably!  After using it several times on my face and waiting before putting on moisturizer, I did not notice that drawn and tight feeling I used to feel with soap on my medium-dry skin.  The light aroma is pleasant, not overwhelming.The first time I used it, I pumped the same amount into my hand as I would with Cetaphil, a spot about the size of a nickel.  The transparent cleanser formed a white foam on my face that took several rinses to remove.

"Mice seem to appear at random times, and we blame their arrival on rain, drought, cold weather, but one idea prevails:  Get rid of them!  They are destructive and filthy.  Glue traps are easy to place along a wall, with a dab of peanut butter or chocolate candy pushed onto the center of the trap.  They do not require the dexterity to set as many mousetraps.  It is best to set the glue traps against walls where you believe the mice are running.  They can be set behind stoves and under low furniture.  Just be sure to check them and remove trap and mouse by scooping them up with a piece of cardboard.Glue traps are far superior to bait stations, which do kill the mice, but the dead mice often end up between the walls and causing a characteristic stench.  If the mouse dies outside, it may be carried away and eaten by a bird, which also may die from the rodent poison. Killing rodents is not pleasant at all, but if maintaining your food, linens, electrical wiring is important, glue traps are great.  These come in a package of six, stuck together, which seals them until you need them.  The package states that these contain state-of-the-art materials to make them extra dependable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNICEODV6WC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UOHK84#wasThisHelpful","RFNICEODV6WC6","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This colander is a typical OXO offering:  Take a common household item, and add some outstanding features.  Have you ever been in the middle of preparing a meal, you have a dirty pan in the sink, and now, the vegetables need to be washed and drained?  Do you toss the vegetables into a colander then realize there's no place to set it in the sink?  Not with this Over-The-Corner model.  Simply drop this colander onto the upper corner of the sink, letting it rest on the edge, and rinse away.  Washing the pan can wait.The secret of the tight grip this colander maintains while suspended from the counter is that it creates its own support against the sides of the sink.  Besides the wide lip that rests on the counter, there are small, probably silicone, supports on the outside of each side that make contact with the sink, aiding in the support.  The weight of the food itself creates the secure grip.  So clever.It wouldn't be a review without an ""if only"" paragraph.  If only there were a hole in one of the corners of the lip for hanging, it would be easier to find a storage spot for this colander that doesn't nest in anything I own because of its unconventional shape.

"This compact over-the-door rack has six hooks that could be used in many situations, especially in a bathroom or bedroom, or even a home office.  The silicone knobs at the ends of the hooks keep slippery sweaters from hitting the floor, and prevent hook marks in the backs of jackets and sweaters, very nice features.  Other pieces of silicone on the backs of the hooks prevent marks on the doors.  The adjustable feature of the part that fits over the door means that the whole rack will not slip around when I remove an item.  The rack is solidly made and unobtrusive.The Amazon.com webpage states that the rack works best if there is at least a 3/16"" gap between the top of the door and the door frame.  What they mean is, that without that gap, the rack will not fit over the door and allow the door to close.  In my crazy old house, none of the 1880s doors had that gap, which wasn't terribly surprising.  Even in the 1980s addition to the house, that has standard pre-hung doors, only two of the six doors had the required clearance.  The lesson here is to measure that gap before ordering or be prepared to plane or possibly saw a little wood off the top of the door.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUT9JHU9TTEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034MWFBI#wasThisHelpful","R1PUT9JHU9TTEA","AVU9EZ7I2ND6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU9EZ7I2ND6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am delighted to have this towel set, even though I do not (gasp!) participate in yoga classes or any workouts outside my home.  I am finding the big towel perfect for putting down on the carpet in my exercise/spare room.  I was using a regular bath towel, but this is like heaven.  I am almost six feet tall, and so is the large towel, which is a luxury and protects the carpet.  There is no bunching; the towel lies flat and does not curl at the ends.  While I might wish the small face towel were a few inches wider, it is a handy size to drape around my neck and to wipe my face and neck.  The fabric, while it looks as if it would be rough like canvas, is very soft, especially now that it has been washed a couple of times. It can go into the dryer, but I just draped the towels over my drying rack, and they were dry in a few hours.  All of the outer binding stitching is neatly finished, with no loose edges, and when I accidentally caught the towel on a rough back of a chest of drawers, no threads became unraveled.

"Cooking on the outdoor grill means no stove or oven to clean, a very good thing. The 8.25"" x 11"" cooking surface is the right size to cook a side dish for two - maybe four people while the main course is cooking on the other side of our two-burner Weber gas grill, and it fits perfectly.  This griddle is a very heavy gauge stainless steel, with nicely finished edges, and simple-to-use tilt mechanism to allow grease to drain off.  I've let it heat up then oiled it, and browned par-cooked potatoes so they're crispy.  Also, I made some rice patties with egg as a binder.  I had to turn the heat on the burner way down for these to avoid burning, but they did cook in about the same time as the meat on the other side.  Clean-up was easy.

"Each of my kids, when they left home to set-up housekeeping in college, received a little George Foreman grill that probably was used to warm take-out and frozen burritos.  The new 2-in-! Evolve Grill is larger and has features that make it appropriate for a real, grown-up kitchen.I started with the waffle plates (which are a traditional non-stick, not ceramic), and used the suggested 425 degree setting. The results were great, if a bit non-traditional size: 5.5"" x 7"".Grilling this way is new to me, so I experimented with hamburgers and chicken breasts.  The sear function creates nice grill marks, although the actual time for boneless chicken breasts was at the short side of the suggested range.  I realize the manufacturers are required to use USDA mandated internal temperatures, but food continues to cook after it's removed from the heat source.  Also, consider the starting temperature of the food.  Be careful, or you could end up with a very dry dinner.  Cooking time on hamburgers varies according to taste; it's easy to open the grill and pull one burger off for a rare-meat lover and then continue with the cooking for others.  In all the experiments, the ceramic grills are very easy to clean and don't need to go into the dishwasher.I like it.

"This powerhouse vacuum cleaner is intended for effective cleaning by professional cleaning crews.  When it arrived, I immediately assembled it (well, not immediately, see last paragraph), and used it in my small home with all sorts of small tables, throw rugs, stairs - not open expanses of carpet and hard flooring one would encounter in an office, for example.  The machine is relatively quiet, and has extremely good suction.  It was able to glide under the edges of couches and some chairs.  It moved easily from rug to hard floor, as turning off the beater bar is accomplished with a switch right on the handle.  It was not able to squeeze into the somewhat narrow spaces between walls and ends of couches, for example.  This would require using the extension wand, which is on-board.  Simply turn off the beater bar, attach the clever included stair tool.  Unfortunately, the wand is not long enough to reach the floor without bending.  In addition, the instructions with the machine warn users to hold onto the main vacuum handle while using the wand, probably in response to the tipping problem mentioned by other reviewers. The edge cleaning demanded by home vacuum users is non-existent.However, there's lots of work for this vacuum in the halls of our small apartment building.  Perfect.About the assembly:  It took two of us almost an hour to get the alignment of the carry-handle/hose winding apparatus holes to line up to screw on the essential part.  The top of the container that holds the filter bag must be pushed on really HARD to get it to stay in place.

"These are a well-made set of two potholders with a pocket on one side that allows them to be used as a mitt.

His business focuses on cell phone, computer, and TV reparation, so he got the hang of it fast. He was able to maximize the camera's potential and features, unlike us. He told us that the best part about this camera is the quality. He says the picture quality is crisp and clear.  He said the design made certain positions a little difficult to maneuver, but that he settled for other positions instead, no biggie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF5B4BK3OFVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS5L78#wasThisHelpful","R3JF5B4BK3OFVU","A13X8M8UBOELX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13X8M8UBOELX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I hope you can find my personal experience with this item helpful.*It was only recently that I heard these type of products existed. A brush that can straighten really? Well, I received it while very skeptical.... fortunately right away, I was really happy and impressed. My mom has really curly, kinky hair and it left hers just like mine looks in the pic, so I don't think the brush discriminates against any hair type. Mine is wavy, and really damaged by the way.Something that I really liked was that it measured the current temperature. I can't say I've tried many brands of straighteners, but I have tried a good amount and none of them had that effect.  Usually I become desperate and start using irons on my hair right away, even though they are 1 minute into heating so I am glad this one advised me that it was NOT yet at my desired temperature.Another pro is that two brushes down the same area were enough! I know I could have gotten a more dramatic straight effect had I gone for 4 brushes, but that was not my desire.Overall, I do think this product is worth the 5 stars. The price is not bad, and is similar if not less to other straighteners. It cut my time by 2/3rd's and it was way more simple to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353SOVFS6J30C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPHCB64#wasThisHelpful","R353SOVFS6J30C","A13X8M8UBOELX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13X8M8UBOELX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was very down to the point and interesting. I know NOTHING about Scientology to be honest, but I tried to learn and pick up from it as much as I could. Leah Remini was real, and not only did she share things about Scientology, she also let us into her marriage and her family life. This read was raw, funny, and sometimes creepy. And it made me want to learn more about the subject. The book is shocking, but I think she maintains class. I keep thinking about what she must have purposely left out, haha.She starts off by talking about Scientology right off the bat. She mentions how courses alone were 2 million dollars!!!! She mentions how it was actually her mother who got her into it as a child. NOTE: I only started hearing about this religion 10 years ago, so I had no clue it had been going on for so long. Due to Scientology having the tendency of seeing children as equally wise and important as adults, it gave her confidence and acknowledgement if you will. She then went on to join Sea Org (a place I had never heard about until now), and recalls how the nursery there had squalid conditions for the babies left there by members. She spoke about the RPF, (another thing I had never heard about before.) The Rehabilitation Project Force, where behind the scenes, people pretty much had to beg for table scraps, and not speak unless spoken to. (I cannot wait to do some reading on that.)She mentions sleeping around a lot, but settling down once she met her husband even though she found out he was married at the time after sleeping with him.  She actually had him and his wife at the time take Scientology courses, LOL, to which she later got in trouble for once the wife released that info to STAR magazine. Something called the “disconnection policy” where she was asked to either leave her husband, or have him drop contact with his previous family. She ultimately ignored them and finds out she is expecting.We then hear how only after giving the church a 1 million dollar donation, that she got to meet Tom Cruise, almost as if that was her reward. She had awkward moments with Tom and Katie, and noticed how 2 specific Sea Org handlers were ALWAYS around them. Once Katie left Tom, Leah began to see things clearly and started opening up about her frustrations with the handlers, which caused a lot of drama. She started raising concern over Shelly Miscavige’s whereabouts. She started losing friends and kept telling herself that if Nicole Kidman was able to continue her life that she could too… even though she never even met the woman.Overall we learn interesting tidbits about Tom’s tantrums,  how nice and peachy her years were besides The King of Queens, some drama she had with Sharron Osbourne, and some off-camera drama at Dancing with the Stars. We learn dirt about her family, mostly about her mom, lol, and how her leaving made them closer as a family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUWUBRBFUZQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110188696X#wasThisHelpful","R1GUWUBRBFUZQQ","A13X8M8UBOELX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13X8M8UBOELX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Once he told me afterwards, I started laughing. Usually I can tell with any condom, in a bad way. It always the man that feels them, but when it comes to me I'm the same and hate them. I did not feel that gross, plastic, fake feeling. It felt like the real deal, my husband agreed too.

"My kids had an older model and used it for a while before getting bored.  This newer version  arrived complements of the Amazon Vine program  and they have renewed their interest in it for sure. It is simply a fun, lightweight, portable little writer where kids can play hangman, tic-tac-toe, and other quick games while in the car  or elsewhere. It is especially fun for younger ones like to draw and a race, scribble and create their own doodles. We had no issue with the erase button whatsoever. It worked perfectly each time. I love that the magnet keeps the unit close at hand either on our office cabinet or fridge.  It is especially useful while doing math homework with the kids. Quick write on and wipe off without the need for tons of scrap paper.  The stylus slips into the edge of the writer to make a kickstand but we would not see a use for this since you cannot use the stylus once it's being used to prop up the writer.  We have not used the option to download the notes onto an app, but we are aware that it exists.

"If we weren't diehard 49ers fans we would not have looked twice at this but it was a clever way to bring our favorite team to our home office compliments of the Amazon Vine program.  First I'll say that the stapler is solid in hand yet not overly heavy.  It opens easily for tacking.  That's where the pros end.  It did not provide more than four consecutive stapled papers before it jammed.  It is supposed to be jam-free according to the packaging.  I cleared the jam once, then twice.  It most definitely will staple a dozen sheets of paper, but not 25 like the package states.  Swingline is normally a dependable brand in office supplies so maybe this was just a bad apple.

"Told from the husband's perspective, LIKE FAMILY is the story of a young couple and their son whose relationship with Mrs. A as their housekeeper/ nanny / friend becomes a metaphor for their lives together.  Affectionately known as Babette, Mrs. A. helps each partner learn more about themselves and each other, just through her strong  and  benevolent presence in the home.  Diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Mrs. A. valiantly tries to savor each moment of her life, however much time there is left to it.  Deeply missing her long deceased husband, Renato, Mrs. A. finds stability and comfort in the caring for the small family. Her bond with wife, Nora, is akin to mother – daughter and since Mrs. A. never had children of her own she can offer advice, a shoulder to lean on, and old fashioned wisdom on marriage to the couple who are somewhat out of touch with each other.The story is poetically written with a somewhat somber tone, sometimes  without even a glimmer of lightness,  especially after the cancer diagnosis. I found it very heavy hearted at times, especially as the disease progresses and the couple sees more and more cracks in their relationship as their beloved Mrs.  A. approaches death. Regret, loss, and the realization of the fleeting nature of time are all themes prevalent  throughout this beautiful story. The way the relationships are intimately woven like a fabric helps magnify the emotions  during various stages of the story and of the cancer itself.Inevitably, the couple learns so much about their own relationship--acceptance, patience and devotion,  mainly thanks to their devotion toMrs. A. and her love for them in return.  I found myself weepy at many points during this book, finding it hard to put down though I knew inevitably how it would end.  A small yet sharply personal story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8CYUN9RKE4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428763#wasThisHelpful","R1S8CYUN9RKE4S","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Carhartt is a trusted name in well made, rugged outdoor men's clothing.  Receiving this compliments of the Amazon Vine program, we were delighted that it is a Women's Jacket and with fall upon us here in the Northeast, it was a welcomed addition to our wardrobe.  With cozy soft camo fleece lining throughout {including in the hood}, this jacket will easily take us into colder winter months.  It is a soft shade of light violet called Sandstone and it's perfect for young ladies.  It holds quite a rectangular shape on your body, which some people might not appreciate.  Perhaps to make it a bit more feminine they could have cinched the stitching on the waist a bit, but this is still fine for casual outdoor wear.  The front pockets are deep, the inner pockets will hold your wallet, cell phone, keys, etc.  One pocket closes with Velcro and the other does not.  I know from prior purchases that Carhartt clothing launders well and over time will become much softer.  The stiffness of the material is at its toughest when the item is brand new.  While the material is not 100% waterproof, you will certainly stay dry in a light rain or snowfall.  Great for camping trips, hiking, biking and just enjoying nature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0FYU5J38H7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6Y6I6M#wasThisHelpful","R1U0FYU5J38H7V","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We received a 4 pound bag of this dog food courtesy of the Amazon Vine  program. Our 9 pound Chihuahua mix is seven years old and tends to gain weight quickly because she has a voracious appetite.  For this reason we have had to reduce the serving of her major label dry food from what she has been used to in order to get her to optimal trim size.  This resulted in her always being hungry and begging for table food.We did the switch to this food over a 10 day period  and have been very pleasantly surprised. First it does not smell funky like most other dry dog foods. From the moment we opened the bag it smelled very appetizing. Each morsel is shaped like a three dimensional triangle and our dog immediately loved crunching on it when we gave her one to try.  By the time we had transitioned to this food hundred percent we had noticed she had less bowel movements, was not as thirsty as before and had a softer coat.  I'm not saying this food worked magic that quickly but we are pleased with her weight and she seems much more satisfied after her daily meals.  I'm pretty certain this is due to the protein rich, grain free formula.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHWDBJ5DFXVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VTQB6W#wasThisHelpful","R1IHWDBJ5DFXVZ","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We received this courtesy of the Amazon Vine program.  Yankee Candle's popularity centers around the beautiful selection of candles whose names capture the essence of the scents.  We've bought these for many years during various seasons and most of the time we come to the same conclusion after burning them…The fragrance doesn't smell enough when lit!  Unless you burn it  for quite a long while, the fragrance does not fill the room whatsoever. You get the strongest, truest scent only when smelling the candle in the jar.  This fresh bread scent is delicious in the jar, but once lit the smell pretty much disappears until nearly an hour of burn time, then you can detect a faint smell in the room.For the high price you pay for Yankee Candles, it would be great if they actually filled the room with the scents we love.Just a side note:  Bath and Body Works candles are a few dollars less costly and yet the scents are similar and the fragrance fills the air wonderfully when lit!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPAS48GYYPV9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZKWUSK#wasThisHelpful","RPAS48GYYPV9W","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having purchased something similar years ago, we expected this to be a beautiful addition to the wall in our master bathroom. What it turned out to be was a very poor quality peel off plastic set of letters,  It's supposedly was to be applied with a transfer sheet but this was a joke since it was separated from the set of letters in shipping, which took nearly one month to arrive from China.  I ultimately had to peel and stick each letter, several of them tore easily, and the result is nothing short of sloppy.  You get what you pay for.  But in this case I got even less than that.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZCZD2NWYT1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028X11MS#wasThisHelpful","R2VZCZD2NWYT1E","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This soft activity book came to us courtesy of the Amazon Vine program.  It is part of a series of sensory books for infants ages 6+ months.  This 1-2-3 Count edition is colorful and appealing with animals throughout.  Press the circular sound piece for a weird sounding ""animal"" voice which counts down each number and names the food on every page.  There are crinkly sounds on soft padded pages and peek-a-boo flaps for self discovery.  I like that it folds easily to stash in the stroller and has a loop for hanging.

The color was crisp white and each towel has a long and sturdy label loop making hanging very convenient.  They laundered extremely well and fluffed up beautifully in the dryer.  I would love these in a beige or ivory shade.  They are well made, thick and of great quality and highly absorbent.  They did not retain a musty odor after several days of use like other, more cheaply made towels can.  I attribute this to the bamboo in the fabric.

"This package of Ladies Bikini pants came to us courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program.  First thing I noticed was that the material was stretchy and lightweight, felt like the kind of material which runner's shirts are made of, namely the micro-mesh which makes it breathable.  The fit was snug despite the fact that we wear the same size 8 all the time in regular cotton underpants so I'm uncertain why these don't fit the same.  The package states that the fabric is ventilated and I can't say one way or the other whether this is true since we wore these under our jeans and couldn't tell the difference.  The colors are nice and they laundered well.  Love that they're tag free.  Reason for three stars is simply due to the oddly small fit.  Otherwise they are comfy and of good quality workmanship.  I don't see these shredding in my washing machine for a long time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASKVD5GERA9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV7STU#wasThisHelpful","RASKVD5GERA9O","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She loves the actual photos from the movie, introductions and bits of information about all the characters, a message from the fairy godmother, the characters' future dreams for themselves, what classes they enjoy the most… Just like a real life high school yearbook!

"This item arrived courtesy of the Vine program.  My 11 year old put it together in ten minutes following the step by step instructions.  Right off the bat our cat found her way into the cubby.  Then the dog decided to try out the plush side!  You will have to have enough floor space for this since it was bigger than expected and has a very wide footprint.  The toy remained untouched after one week but this is likely because our kitty forgot about toys a long time ago.  I suppose it would keep younger cats entertained for plenty of hours.

"Velcro products are supposed to make life easier, safer, and neater.  This item does none of these things. With directions so convoluted you could spend an eternity trying to figure out that what they mean by ""cord"" is really just the other side of the Velcro strip.  Why not just say that?  There is no protection from anything as the package implies, and all you are doing is simply threading one end of the cord through the slit on the Velcro strip, and then wrapping the other end of the Velcro  over to tighten the cord into the Velcro. Big deal! How is this helping?  Sadly there is nothing useful about this item whatsoever.  One reviewer posted excellent  photos showing exactly what this item looks like once you thread a cord end to end.  Basically a big ""so what?!""

"This appliance came to us compliments of the Amazon Vine program.  As with all other products, I tested this for several weeks before compiling my findings.  Here is what I conclude.  Though Cuisinart is a top rated brand in kitchen appliances, I find this particular blender to be less than expected.  To start, it takes up way too much counter space making it a no-no for daily use unless I had a bigger kitchen.  Next, the powerful motor is so loud it can be heard three rooms away in our home, no kidding.  Also, I prefer glass containers and this one is heavy duty, BPA free plastic, which makes the entire unit lighter weight but this isn't a necessity for me as I find that plastic retains a certain odor over time, especially when you blend vegetables, and even with excellent washing (dishwasher safe) the smell will be there if you use it long enough.  With a glass container, this would not be an issue whatsoever.  My old Hamilton Beach blender had a wonderful glass container and never smelled odd even after years of use.  Last but not least, the base of the plastic jar has a screw off blade which, if not precisely and perfectly replaced after washing, will leak all over the motor base when you fill it the next time.  We learned the hard way that we can't screw it in hastily unless we want a mess next time.  In other blenders I've used, the blade in the base of the jar never gets removed, you just wash the entire piece in warm and soapy water.  Here are the positives, and they are important.  The easy to use settings allow you to make smoothies and cremate basically anything from carrots, celery, apples, kale, you name it, the results will not disappoint.  Each button clearly indicates what it is best for.  We made a nice salsa with mango and tomatoes, a lovely puree of steamed sweet potato and carrots and a thick chocolate milkshake, all while experimenting with the different speeds, and all done with only one push of the button.  Our smoothies with ice, yogurt and several fruits were gourmet quality, especially since the ice was crushed perfectly in no time.  I would give this five stars if only for the jar, loud motor and removable base blades.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KAIE16WL6EHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVWGM48#wasThisHelpful","R3KAIE16WL6EHB","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This calendar arrived courtesy of the Amazon Vine program and within ten seconds from unwrapping was confiscated by my middle school daughter.  She absolutely went wild for the cover designs, the lovely interior page floral and scroll designs, the color palette used throughout, and the logical way the months are laid out.  July 2015 through July 3, 2016, the cover is durable plastic and has an inside page with 2014-2016 years for reference.  Months are separated by a plastic tab (we'd have preferred a separate divider sheet with perhaps a storage pocket).  Every page holds space for notes at the start of the month, and daily lined sections for each day.  A two-page full month spread starts every separate month with the traditional boxes to see your whole month at a glance as well as a small prior month and next month reference.  The very end of the calendar has two full pages for CONTACTS and NOTES and an Event Calendar and HOLIDAY LIST which shows holidays through 2018.  This is especially handy.  The lovely floral and scroll design gives every page a cheery, happy feel, very appropriate for desktop, school or dorm.  The generous size makes it easy to write all you need and carry with other  notebooks and files.  A good choice for the upcoming academic year.

"This may perhaps be the best book I've read in many years.  I was drawn in by the title and the cover, a sweet combination of sugar donuts making up the ""00"" in 100, and the title itself, ""100 Days of Happiness"" as I'm always curious as to how authors unravel the happiness mystery to their readers.  The question posed:  WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU KNEW YOU HAD ONLY 100 DAYS LEFT TO LIVE?  Wow!  Actually, I'd never contemplated this question.  Until now.Author Fausto Brizzi has a splendid, conversational style.  His pages read like a letter from a friend.  He mixes cleverness with humor, and creates a character who is both humble and self deprecating with all his foolish imperfections, transgressions and sins.  After the first several chapters which lead us up to the actual stage four liver cancer diagnosis, the book counts down from Day 100 to the last Day 1 in the life of Lucio Battistini, an Italian man who savors a freshly made donut at sunrise the way most people enjoy sex.  We relate to this character from the onset, as he is a very likeable guy, though not without his faults.  He cheated on his wife and got thrown out of the house, but he works tirelessly to gain her forgiveness while staying close to their two children.  He treasures his two lifelong friends, hangs out with his father-in-law who runs the pastry shop with those great donuts, and gets a natural high over coaching water polo.Now enter the tragedy.  After ignoring pains for quite some time, and neglecting his wife's instructions to have an abdominal sonogram, he gets the sobering news that he has inoperable liver cancer which has metastasized to his lungs.  Basically, his days are numbered....100 to be exact.  Raw emotion is evoked in the plain and simple truth that his cancer will kill him before the change of seasons.  What follows is a 100 day personal journey to live out his days on his terms.  He does things we only dream of doing, such as quitting a now loathsome job.  He makes peace with his past and even finds his creative side while beginning a journal in an old grade school notebook and jotting down a sort of ""bucket list"" of dreams to achieve while he still has the time.  Accurate and detailed medical terminology adds authenticity to this ""every man's (or woman's) story of life, love, loss and death.  It makes you pause to consider ""what if it were me...?""  Reference is made to the fact that life is nothing but a collection of ""last times"" i.e., the last time you talk to your father...take a swim in the sea...kiss the woman you love. The chapters had me feeling a range of emotions ~ sadness, hopelessness, hope, then even more sadness, and deep empathy.  One poignant quote stood out:  ""I realize that I can't seem to think about anything but the past and the future.  It's as if the present has lost all meaning to me.

"I purchase two or three At-A-Glance planners every year.  Normally I carry a pocket size planner in my purse, then use a full size one such as this at work.  This July, 2015-June 2016 Academic Calendar came to us compliments of the Vine program and was immediately an eye catcher on my desk in the classroom.  The cover has a faux leather look and a lovely aqua blue spiral ring along with cover detailing.  I love the generous 8 3/8"" x 11"" sizing and multiply ways in which each month is laid out.  First you have a two page spread at the start of each month with large daily boxes.  Next there are side by side lay outs of each date (four days per side) and the lined spaces under each date give you loads of room to write notes, appointments, numbers, etc.  At the end of each month there are boxes for notes in general.  Each month is separated by a tab divider page showing the month in clear orange letters.  The very end of the calendar has two pages for 20 contacts, and ten plain notebook style pages, followed by a page with a Twelve Month Event Calendar, a full page Holiday List through 2018, and a US Time Zones and Area Codes map.  Top it all off at the very last page with a clear plastic pocket folder which includes both front and rear side pockets.  This is a jam packed planner that is well worth the money.  The only reason I give it three rather than five stars is because the cover is flimsy.  I would much prefer a harder, flexible plastic to withstand daily use or travel in and out of briefcase when needed.  Otherwise, a beautifully appointed Academic Year Calendar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4AXTDNMCBIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC6XZM#wasThisHelpful","R3R4AXTDNMCBIP","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These ""handy-wipe"" type towels are perfect for quick kitchen and bath clean ups.  I received a two pack compliments of the Amazon Vine program and promptly began using one in the master bath and the other in the kitchen.  The cloth is very soft and absorbent.  The soap holds well in the subtle grooves of the material.  I washed a sink of pasta pots and the sauce stained the towel a bit, so into the laundry it went.  It laundered quite well, and of course I air dried it rather than the clothes dryer.  The print remained clear and sharp, no flaking or peeling.  I would not purchase these, however, because they are so much like a thicker version of Handy Wipes that it would not be worth the added cost just to have the design.  Also, Handy-Wipes are much larger.  These are basically the size of a pot holder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQQETDGPSAQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PI7O4#wasThisHelpful","R1EQQETDGPSAQT","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This machine is a lifesaver in our home.  A family with allergies, we are four people who sneeze year round with all sorts of environmental triggers, i.e., household dust, aerosol sprays, perfumes, etc.  Add to this list the pollen, mold spores, pet dander and trees and you can picture our watery eyes, drippy noses and tickling throats.  This air purifier is both lightweight and portable.  It measures 28"" high x 7"" wide x 9"" deep and is a neutral colored creamy white.  We set it up in less than 60 seconds, literally.  Just remove the filters from the protective plastic, then place both the carbon filter and the white filter together inside the front panel, snap close and you're ready to turn on the unit.  It has a nice quiet motor so you won't be disturbed.  We placed this in our bedroom for a week and after checking the filter found lots of dust, hair and dirt particles which were captured by the filters.  Rather than waking up with a stuffy nose and headache, this actually helped keep our sinuses open and allowed us to get a more peaceful night's sleep.  Though the unit is advertised as ""Baby"" air purifier we certainly would recommend this for any room in the house, whether with an infant or without.  Various handy features on the front of the machine make it easy to adjust the strength of the motor, and the panel lights dim so your sleep isn't interrupted.  This would come in handy in a dorm room also, especially if there are smokers around.  It also sucks the stinky air out of the house if you are cooking something pungent like fish.  Fellowes makes products perfect for the home and office and this HEPA Air Purifier is no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKVS9H3YVDPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31B0YU#wasThisHelpful","R2HKVS9H3YVDPM","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our child's bedside turtle light runs on three AA batteries.  Since the touch  light stays lit for 10 minutes at a time, it can be reactivated with a simple touch  and throughout the night, our child will reactivate the light.

"Pros:  sprayed on white yard chairs, deck box, and composite deck then hosed off to find a clean and like-new appearance awaiting beneath.  I didn't even use a scrub brush!  Foaming action literally washed away the winter green and brown yard scum.  Used more spray on white yard fence and yielded same stellar results.Cons:  because the nozzle did NOT open as easily as instructions stated, we leaked enough liquid to stain our hands a powdery white which would later dry to a crusted film.  Not happy about that at all.  Wear gloves by all means when using this product.  And if your nose and eyes are sensitive to chemicals, play it safe by throwing on dollar store protective goggles.  To use this product, we had to pour entire bottle into another plain empty spray bottle to use it the normal way, without hooking up to hose.  I found an nearly empty kitchen cleaner and rinsed it out to use with this product.I don't think I'd purchase it again because I could get the same results with other products and a scrub brush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0VTY6X2EYU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZO2YS#wasThisHelpful","R1N0VTY6X2EYU6","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not something I'd purchase myself, but as a complimentary Amazon Vine product we will happily use and for the purpose of this honest review.  Washed quickly with soap and warm water, did not stain with dressings and did not retain any odors.  Non-microwaveable but they are dishwasher safe.

Convenient front slot for SD card, and easy on-screen menu to adjust paper settings and scroll trough all the printer features, i.e., scanning and social media uploading (Facebook).

"I am reading this book as a ""starter"" for deeper meditation  during a particularly stressful time in our lives. The  daily readings are short, follow similar themes, and leave you with a question to apply to your real life situations.  Not so much a journal as it is a theme book to lead you towards further  exploring your thoughts and feelings on a deeper spiritual level. Quite thin and light weight, this paperback book is neat, crisply bound, and easy to bring along on your daily commute.  Print size is  basically larger than Bible print, but smaller than regular book print. I agree that the space after the meditations is small, allowing for a few thoughts or words, not full journal entries.  I did not find this to be a problem as I jotted key words related to the question, then used each daily reading and subsequent question to reflect more deeply and privately each Sunday during worship services. The questions offer opportunities to contemplate personal experiences in work life, family dynamics, and personal growth.  Some meditations, quite frankly, forced me to take pause to answer some very important personal questions.  Thought-provoking little book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z03QMAQPGY6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160926181X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z03QMAQPGY6V","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Received this courtesy of the Amazon Vine program.  I wanted to like this because the dispenser holds the roll of glue dots conveniently, unlike when you buy a box of them and they get stuck on the interior of the box.  This dispenser is easy to hold and the roller action is smooth.  However, and it's s BIG HOWEVER, the dots are positioned closely together and do not easily move without balling up like a clump of rubber.  Furthermore the box states they hold up to 2 pounds ---- not when I used them!  I ran a long strip across the bottom of a cotton curtain panel to try to shorten the curtain length and not only did the dots roll right off the material but there was no holding power whatsoever on the hem.  I would use this for scrapbooking but because the dots are too close and you really cannot easily control shorter rolls of the dispenser, I will have to toss this as it really won't offer much convenience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z14SFIVF8WXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZ0AS4#wasThisHelpful","R2Z14SFIVF8WXG","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She promptly assembled all parts and organized her colors to make the red apple.  First there was not enough yarn to complete the project.  Then the instructions were unclear, often just telling the user to cut the yarn, without specifying how long to cut.  Certain colors were required that were not even in the box.  The end result didn't look like an apple because of the lack of proper yarn colors.  It turned out just like a pom pom.

This easy to store and even easier to dispense pump bottle is perfect for bedside or vanity in your bath or bedroom.  Though it states Fragrance-Free, I find it to have a light and lovely soft and gentle scent which is not irritating or offensive.  The consistency is smooth and coverage is complete with only a small pump in your hand.  The product lists 7 benefits all in 1 bottle including smoothing fine lines (this worked for me!), evening skin tone, enhancing brightness (again a plus for me) and restoring firmness and moisture.  I didn't notice a visible reduction in the appearance of dark patches, but this wasn't a deal breaker for me, I still loved all the other benefits.  Apply to a clean face for an all-over feeling of fresh, healthy and youthful skin.  With an SPF of 15 it's perfect for use in the colder months when you don't normally slather on the sunscreen.  Added bonus is that this contains Vitamins E and B3 along with other nutrients that help your skin stay smooth and youthful looking.  I apply both in the morning before my minimal makeup routine, then again before bedtime after the daily grime is washed away.  I recommend this for all skin types as well.

"We have just gotten braces in our home, so this was a must have for the bathroom.  I loved the small footprint of this unit, much better than the full sized Waterpik.  The green receptacle holds enough water for two people to use the machine.  The stickers were cute, and they're removable, coming in both girl and boy designs.  I was sadly disappointed, however, in the NOISE THIS THING MAKES!  Wow!  If you think you could use this when someone is sleeping in the next room, think again.  And don't even consider turning it on if you just got the baby to fall asleep.  This sounds like a jack hammer and I'm not certain why.  Nothing is malfunctioning, no leaks and no broken parts, just an extremely loud motor.  Oh well, at least it does the job.  Three settings are available, but the first one is pretty lame.  Our kids use the second one with good results.  There are two attachments to choose from, one for braces and one for regular teeth.  You can also purchase others so that other family members can use the same machine.  Keep it empty and dry between uses so that you don't wind up with bacteria or odor.  Good machine for the price.  If it weren't so loud I'd have easily given it five stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZ3IEZEWMA2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y99EO6#wasThisHelpful","R3IZ3IEZEWMA2A","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new iPhone 6 is much thinner than previous versions, so protecting my investment was paramount once I brought home the new toy.  This LAX case arrived just in time compliments of the Amazon Vine program.  I was impressed with how comfortable the case felt in my hand.  Its perimeter is rubber so you can grip the phone well.  The back is nicely designed with a raised ribbed pattern which has a cut out circle so you can still view the Apple logo on your phone.  The access to buttons is perfect with only one very small exception.  The cut out for the mute button on the left side is just a tad too deep to quickly flip the switch, so I find that I have to really get the right corner of my fingernail in there in order to activate the mute function.  All the other cut outs are perfect and allow total, easy access.  I have a tempered glass protection on the phone and the case does not interfere with it whatsoever.  I like that this offers good protection without adding noticeable weight to the phone itself.  I have the gold iPhone 6 and this case just so happened to come in gold, so the pairing is complete.  Love this product and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N6642VEVOEU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH0IXDC#wasThisHelpful","R2N6642VEVOEU6","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a home with organizational junkies.  This bin seemed like a great little holder of all things tossed in our food pantry.  I love the fact that it's clear and very sturdy, and that it has a handle.  That's where the love ends.  It is really pretty useless.  It stores minimal items because of the narrow rear, and unless you have a HUGE shelf with a lazy susan to add a full circle of these to make a complete round, there isn't much you can put in here to justify having it.  I found myself trying to figure out which room would offer the best use but really couldn't see it helping me organize anything much at all.  I wouldn't buy more to make a full circle, but I will say if this were a rectangular shape I would have loved it.  You can't store much in triangles.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYWFZUQVGWSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTSEHZS#wasThisHelpful","R2GYWFZUQVGWSH","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pasta is a favorite staple in our home, right next to rice.  But buying good tasting, healthy pasta is challenging since the traditional whole wheat pastas are mostly awful tasting, especially to children.  This Barilla White Fiber is a healthy alternative and was an instant hit.  Cooking up in a jiffy, the mini penne were tender yet firm, mixed well with my secret mac and cheese recipe and satisfied the masses as a side dish, entrée and snack after school.  The added protein is an appreciated plus.  I watch for sales on Barilla because the brand costs more than others, but when taste is this good, it's worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ3G6JPUZ1QD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA34O#wasThisHelpful","RQ3G6JPUZ1QD3","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This generous sized 16.9 fl. oz. spray bottle came to us from the Amazon Vine program. We have been using it now for over a week on household items such as scatter rugs, throw pillows, blankets that are tossed on la-Z-Boy chairs, and on a sofa where the pets love to nap.  I even sprayed a shower curtain with it for a nice change in the spare bath.  The sent is very pleasant but we overused it on the furniture and the smell wound up burning my throat a bit.  Next time around we used it more sparingly and found that the sent did not offend at all. It was long-lasting and permeated the entire room. I recommend this for any home with pets, smokers, or strong cooking smells. Just be careful around anyone with breathing issues such as asthma or allergies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NM36OVGBCYG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMVC5U#wasThisHelpful","R2NM36OVGBCYG0","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stock up on Plastic Pocket Dividers each year when the kids start school and again while sorting and filing a year's worth of family paperwork.  The Avery line of Big Tab Pocket Plastic Dividers is my go-to product for all my binder organization needs.  The Vine Program sent assortment of awesome Three Pocket Insertable Corner Lock 5 Tab Dividers along with a bonus heavy duty binder to help get us started.  NOTE:  When you purchase these dividers from Amazon, the binder will NOT be included.  Three extra wide pockets allow me to store paperwork without interfering with the 3-holes of the divider.  Corner Lock tabs prevent the papers from falling out but beware of stretching them too far because they rip easily. Free templates available at avery.com make it a snap to customize the inserts according to your needs.  I can easily fill the pockets with a short stack of standard 8 1/2"" x 11"" papers with no fear of them getting bent or damaged on the ends.

"Bought this because a friend had it and we loved it, so it was a perfect find here on Amazon.com. Sad to say, just seven months after purchasing, we almost had a fire using this thing! The electrical cord became loose from the base of the unit, exposing raw wiring, and sparking with a flame one day while my 11-year-old child was using it! It was totally terrifying, and we were very lucky she did not get burned. This unit was not used daily, nor was it tugged on or abused in anyway. Will never trust this brand again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KXHJYVVG735O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065DJY#wasThisHelpful","R3KXHJYVVG735O","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book came to me from the Amazon Vine program and being a lover of all things Apple, I was excited to start reading this to get some hints on how to better use my iPad mini. Right off the bat I noticed its size and bulk, not exactly what I was expecting.  The colorful pages and layout was nice but the print size a tad too small.  I read several different sections, and after completing the book, I was surprised at how unnecessarily wordy many of the sections become. The author uses frivolous words over and over again.  Too many silly anecdotes fill each section and it gets tiresome quickly.  The author could have cut down on the length of the book easily by getting to the point quickly and more concisely.  The book is over 300 pages long.  I would like to have seen more bulleted pointers and more colors throughout.  Since Apple prides itself on simplicity, both in its design and approach to technology, this book is an ironic opposite of the Apple philosophy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65ILILN4Q5ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118932145#wasThisHelpful","R65ILILN4Q5ZM","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicely designed, this sleek black Belkin case fits your iPhone 6 perfectly.  It has a matte finish, a low profile which easily slips into purse or pocket, and a handy slip in pocket for money or credit card/id.  All cut outs are precise and allow access to every button.  I give it four stars instead of five because the stand does not really hold upright correctly, the phone slips and won't stand up straight.  But since I don't use this feature typically, I am not concerned about it not working.

"Our 8 lb. dog has loved Cesar for six years as a supplement to her regular IAMS dry food..  We previously used only the Cesars pate but over time, we noticed her stools becoming too soft so we stopped feeding it to her.  This new line, Cesar Home Delights, offers something better and different than what we've always used, and since I received a generous case from the Vine Program, I wanted to try our pup on it an see if she would experience any negative bowel issues with this choice.  Well after using this for nearly a month, I'm happy to report that our dog is healthy and loving it, no bowel issues whatsoever, and she laps it up like a Thanksgiving feast.  The substantial and juicy sauce adds to a perfect consistency with the meat and veggies.  Opening this tray, you are not overwhelmed by a ""dog food"" smell like with so many other brands.  Rather, this container smells like real roasted chicken, very succulent and flavorful.  I feed her half a tray each day along with her usual dry IAMS and she's maintained a healthy weight.  I will try the beef variety next time.  NOTE:  The Amazon Vine page said I'd receive the Beef Stew, however, we received Low Cooked Chicken & Vegetables Dinner and it is wonderful.  Loaded with vitamins, minerals, chicken and vegetables like peas, carrots and potatoes.  A good choice for your dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RIUQXVWBXLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLSBJOS#wasThisHelpful","R38RIUQXVWBXLR","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not sure why these are marked BUNN because they are not tall enough to properly hold coffee in my BUNN brewer.  When we bought our machine, it came with a sample pack of filters and they were wonderful.  We figured buying only BUNN replacement filters would ensure a correct fit.  We were surprised to see the price was higher for these name brand filters, and then totally disappointed in how they hold (or didn't hold!) the grinds.  Each and every brewed pot yielded an overflow of grinds.  We were not guilty of over filling, we know how to make coffee.  I am going to write or phone BUNN, they've always been helpful with other questions about the machine, and see what they suggest.  I love my coffee machine, but I don't like tasting grinds in the cup.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OV4JQM21CGRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IUV3#wasThisHelpful","R1OV4JQM21CGRV","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these around the home for everything from hanging the kids' clothing, belts & baseball caps to draping cell phone charger wires next to our desks.  They are sturdy and apply easily with strong double sided foam tape.  I removed one after application to determine how easily it came off, and I had no issues at all.  Though I prefer invisible clear hooks to white, these are fine since I'm reviewing them for the Vine program.  Package states maximum 2 lbs. and the closest we got to that weight was a child's terry robe.  I would suggest extending the hook depth a tad so that more items could fit on it.  The shallow hook prevents more than two items such as belts or bags to be hung, and for this reason, we couldn't even get close to hanging 2 lbs. worth of accessories on them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LM49PZT3DFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J12Q3YU#wasThisHelpful","R13LM49PZT3DFS","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pads are VERY thick and bulky.  Generally, however, I prefer thinner supers, since puffy pads like these don't yield the most pleasant feeling all day.  Wear these on heavy flow days and you won't worry about leaks since they are highly effective and absorbent.

"Received these with high hopes, since I am a sucker for quick bars to kill the midday hunger pangs and I prefer a healthy alternative to granola bars which are normally loaded with sugar. These are a decent alternative. I tried them for several days, having one in the middle of the afternoon, then waited several hours to see if I would experience any unfortunate gastric issues. Nothing too terrible, maybe a little gassy, but nothing atrocious. Didn't really taste much chocolate in these bars, but the cherry is a strong flavor and quite good. Consistency is a bit like sawdust in a brick, but it is chewy and tasty nevertheless.  It smells like a Christmas fruitcake!  Sugar is the second ingredient after soybean, but the grams will not put you over your daily allowance. I like that they filled me up between lunch and then dinner much later in the evening.

"This little Dynamo is a total mult-task king!  Easy to grip design features a stand up base.  Store extra staples under the rubber flap on the base.  Use the staple lifter (remover) on the rear of the stapler, and sharpen your pencil to a clean, fine point, all with one nifty gadget!  I have several office supplies made by BOSTITCH because I find the brand to be dependable, affordable and long-lasting.  I also have children that are hard on school supplies so if I find something that works well and does more than one thing I appreciate the opportunity to condense my spending and get them things that can be more of an all-in-one item rather than buying separate items for separate functions.  So far none of the features are giving us any problems.  The stapler works well, the sharpener just as well.  I might avoid putting spare staples in the bottom only because the rubber flap seems to like to lift up and this might eventually end up with staples falling out.

"I wanted to love these loafers, not only for the Cole Haan quality name, but for the lovely maple sugar shade and lovely patent.  They basically disappointed in every major area.  First off, they don't fit like a size 8B at all, but more like a Narrow.  My instep was squeezed terribly right under where the tongue is; my toes reached the very front of the shoe where generally there should be a smidgen of wiggle room.  The ankle was irritating and finally, the soles, which are flexible with raised bubbles kind of like cleats, made for precarious walking and in fact, I nearly twisted my ankle because they feel almost like wearing heeled loafers but without the proper support.  I give this shoe two stars because the patent is my favorite material and the color is dreamy.

"Our kids wear navy pants as part of their school uniform.  They go through scores of pants each year because after a dozen or so launderings, they seem to look like rags.  Dickies KHAKI are not only well made and durable, but they look smart enough to wear as a school uniform pant.  I love the button adjustable stretch waist.  Easy machine wash in cold water and tumble dry on low heat.  They need next to no ironing, in fact, I don't have to bother since they come out smooth and neat right from the dryer.

"We are a one cat household and change litter weekly.  This product indeed is lightweight and fragrance free and absorbs quickly, but the clumps are so huge that it take more litter to fill the pan since we have to scoop and dump larger clumps each day.

"Wanted to like this product since it's all natural.  I used it for nearly a month each night and all it did was dry out my skin.  I was not overly enthusiastic in my scrubbing since I didn't want to irritate my face, but even with gentle rinsing, my skin felt tight and dry upon towel drying.  The smell is medicinal and the scent is not at all like I expected considering the yummy organic ingredients it contains.  I also expected a bit of foaming, but unfortunately not even the slightest bubble emerged as I tried lathering.  I have to admit my skin is generally not problematic but I have an occasional breakout on my chin and forehead so I wanted to try this for a refreshingly good cleansing; it might have worked better if I had oily skin.  I will pass it on to my teenaged niece who will benefit from the acidic feel on her hormonal skin.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9ZT406F898G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0D11Y#wasThisHelpful","R2L9ZT406F898G","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Creepy and disturbing, this is one of the late Robin Williams' finest, yet understated roles.  His portrayal of a loner / foto-mat employee / day dreamer / stalker is one that will both jar you and stay with you long after the final credits role.  Williams plays Sy Parrish, a long time employee of a local big box retailer, who develops photos day in and day out with precision and dedication unlike most other employees.  He has an affinity for the members of the Yorkin family, especially the young son, but over time, the attachment becomes an obsession and layers of Sy's demons become undone.  What happens by the end is both shocking, sad and sobering.  A must-see for any fan of psychological thrillers and/or of the great Mr. Williams.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0UO4Q0K4L8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007976U#wasThisHelpful","R1L0UO4Q0K4L8Z","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was searching high and low for a bag that would function as both a work tote and a purse.  This one fit the bill nicely.  I love the pewter color (currently sold out, I got the last one!) and the silver bangles compliment it nicely.  The strap drop is just long enough to fit comfortably on my shoulder over my outerwear.  The material is lightweight faux leather, very supple and soft.  I was hoping the interior zipper pocket was sturdier since I use this frequently and the zipper has already split in the middle but other than that, I was very pleased with the roominess, style and function of this bag.  The other shades of rust and blue which are still available would not be as versatile for my personal every day use, hence, the pewter goes with just about everything I wear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SEGO0RGCMC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLVCDGO#wasThisHelpful","R28SEGO0RGCMC2","A3HETHW2XD3DWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HETHW2XD3DWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One Winters Night- Heather Tullis Jonah Owens was struggling with his art, opening his new gallery and trying to sell his grandmothers house after her fall.  Selling the house would be a lot easier if it wasn't next door to the Red Star Ranch. Farm animals in a residential area wasn't the best selling point. Kaya loved the Ranch working with the children and animals was her dream. The equine therapy business barely kept her head above water, so out of necessity she had to take a part time job over the winter. Jonah losing his part time help takes it out on Kaya. When Kaya leaves her job and is looking for a new one, Jonah's grandmothers send her his way. Desperate enough for the help he hires her. He never planed on the feelings that she brought out in him as her got to know her.  Wonderful book. It wasn't a love at first sight, it is a slow build up story. Way before the end.

"All three books in one. Great way to read a series.Bad Lust-Jake is the guy every women wants to be with, the bad boy. He has no problem being with them all. Except for Jade. After the night with her he hasn't forgotten it. When she winds up as his stepsister, it takes a whole new turn. Jade wants Jake again even though she will try her best not to. He was her first and know living in the same house with I'm makes it that much harder to get him out of her mind. Just one more time. There is so much more to Jake then he shows the world. I think Jade sees that in him. he doesn't want Jade to know he has feelings for her so he comes off hurting her as much as possible. Jade is looking for love and she wants Jake. Some of the time I really wondered why she wanted him. Seriously there is only so much you can take of being put down and hurt.

Neither Jake or Jade will admit or know what it is they are feeling.Bad LoveThe final book in the series. Jade and Jake after everything they have been through. All the ups and downs have finally decided they are going to do what is right for them. They both have had enough of being controlled by parents and their pasts.  I loved the final book.

Towards the middle of the story it picks up the pace. Scarlett feels the attraction to Tripp but for some reason she keeps Andy hanging on thinking he has a chance. I have to say that part bothered me somewhat. When the secret comes out it does make sense in a way. Tripp was great.

Until they both work through what was in the past they can't work towards a future.Book 2- Tatum and Maggie's story- Maggie had met Tatum through Scarlett and while they were both attracted to each other, they never acted on their feelings.

Where as the first book took its time and introduced all the characters, you know them now and it jumps right into it.  Maggie made a promise and it needs to be broken. Some promised especially once under duress should never be kept. There was so much more to Tatum then meets the eye. Decisions that are made sometimes might not seem like the best ones, but they work out for the best.Book 3- Logan and Annie's story- I had trouble warming up to Annie. She was kind and caring and it seemed that fast she would turn. The back and forth is throughout most of the book. While they did have things in common with each other it seemed as if Annie couldn't make up her mind but when the going got tough and Logan needed her she was there. She just needed that extra push to come to terms with her feeling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YCL5DS3SIF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HJTN0#wasThisHelpful","R9YCL5DS3SIF8","A1P44JJW47E6QN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P44JJW47E6QN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I could not hate this product more. I normally really like Physicians Formula products, they are the only drugstore brand I've found that really works well and plays nicely with my more expensive products. I was looking for a powder I could dust over my face that would brighten up my skin (I'm almost 40 and this was a long winter, my skin was looking dull and lifeless) whether I was bare faced or over my foundation. I first tried Hourglass Ambient Lighting powders from Sephora and was extremely disappointed, for the price I saw NO difference in my skin... simply nothing at all. So when I saw this pretty compact on a shopping trip I decided to try it, from the description I thought it might give me the soft glow I was looking for.OH MY GOODNESS... ladies as I mentioned I'm about 40, but even when I was in my 20's and intentionally put glitter all over myself to go out dancing I don't think I'd have liked this. I dusted it LIGHTLY all over my face and from about 5' away it looked ok, but any closer and you saw millions of tiny silver glitter specks all over my face, we're not talking shimmer... we're talking actual glitter. It was so awful I had to wash my face. Not one to give up I tried again another day, same result... I tried UNDER my foundation, nope those dang glitter specks showed through. I suppose I'll use this on my chest/arms maybe for an evening out, or pass it to my tween to play with at home. It's that bad.On the plus side I didn't give up, I read more reviews and several mentioned the Physicians Formula Mineral Glow Pearls, I purchased the Beige Pearl here on Amazon (great price) and it's everything I wanted and more. It's absolutely perfect and gives a healthy glow without glitter. Go check it out but say away from this one unless glitter all over your face is what you're going for, in which case this product will not disappoint.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TVUQBRYKTVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1M6Y9A#wasThisHelpful","R23TVUQBRYKTVL","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm snuggling up to 40 and my skin was looking dull and a bit sad after a long dark winter. I was looking for a powder with a bit of magic (ok shimmer) that I could apply quickly to my bare face to look a bit more alive, or put over my foundation for an even more finished but awake look. I watched 101 videos online and read lots of reviews and actually ordered the Hourglass powder with one of my Sephora hauls. I tried it about 5x and every single time I died a bit inside... I couldn't see ANY difference, not a tiny speck of a difference. I wanted it to work so badly but ended up returning it. I've used Physicians Formula products in the past (they are one of the few drugstore brands I really like) so I next tried a gorgeous palette of theirs I saw in the store ""multicolored custom bombshell bronzer"" I about died again when I tested it at home, my entire face was COVERED in very noticeable silver glitter, I was looking for something that made a difference, but not that big of a difference! I wanted something that gave my face a bit of life and this was like a fairy dusted my face in a very bad way.I almost gave up but saw some references to this powder online. I figured I'd give finding my holy grail product one more chance and ordered it. I tested it as soon as it arrived and WOOHOO, exactly what I was looking for. I purchased it in Beige Pearl and it gives just the right amount of light reflecting soft shimmer but no glitter. It pretty much disappears on my face whether I'm bare faced or have on foundation/blush in that it's not a noticeable color, it just makes my face look brighter and me more awake/lively! I'm considering purchasing one of the darker colors to see if it gives me natural sun kissed look on days I just want to toss on some tinted sunblock and go. If you've been disappointed with other products give this one a try, the price here on Amazon is great too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0A2ALANQW1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039BGHY0#wasThisHelpful","R3N0A2ALANQW1M","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll openly admit that when I first took this fan out of the box I was feeling like I might have made mistake, while it's really cute (normally I'm not even a fan of red, but it's a pure true candy apple red and quite attractive) and felt pretty solid I also felt like it was crazy small. I've paid less than 1/3 the price for fans bigger than this one in the past. I plugged it in (and was impressed that it has it's own fuse, so if it stops working do check that first) and turned it on.WOW! This little fan puts out some air! I do wish there were more than 2 settings, I feel like a medium speed option would be really great but it's not a deal breaker. The fan is pretty quiet on low (almost too quiet if you're someone like me who likes white noise to sleep) but not too loud on high (and it's a nice sound, some fans produce such an awful sound on high you never want to use them, this isn't like that at all). It puts out a nice amount of air on each setting and even on high in front of it you don't feel like you're being attacked by air, just comfortably cooled.Our house is typical of many these days in that the summer can get unbearably hot upstairs even with the air working well on the main floor. Previously we had the large standing fans in each of our bedrooms, which always made me nervous with our youngest as she frequently knocked it over... this fan is going to her room and I know it'll be perfect to keep her cool and is small enough to fit easily on her dresser top. The grills are great and I have no concerns of her or our cats safety. I think I'm going to suck up the expense and purchase 2 more for our other bedrooms and donate those big standing things :)All in all an excellent fan, and the 5yr warranty makes it even more attractive!

"I'm really happy with this EcoTools brush, it's the first I've tried (I've been using a lot of the Real Techniques brushes also sold here on Amazon... which I like so much I've thrown away my old MAC brushes which honestly were never worth the money in the first place)... since I've heard so many great things about this company too I figure I'd try them out.First thing to note is that I was a bit surprised when this brush arrived, the description mentions precise makeup application several times so I thought I was getting a brush I could use for contouring or maybe bold blush application... while I love this brush it wouldn't work for either. This particular brush is really really big... there is no way you're doing anything precise with it in my opinion. It's also VERY soft... it feels heavenly on your face, but again it's much too soft IMO for any contouring or blush (even if you could manage to not apply it to your entire face with this, yes it's that big). It is however WONDERFUL for a final dusting of setting powder, it also works well if you have another sort of finishing powder, or even to apply to your body (something with a big of shimmer maybe along your neck line & arms). I'm looking forward to trying out more of these brushes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBT89FVQHGSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPNV7TE#wasThisHelpful","R2FBT89FVQHGSY","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been really lucky that our American Bulldog/Boxer mix has never had fleas in his 8yrs. He's 99% an indoor dog and pretty much hates going outside so I'm sure that plays into it. I've used Frontline Plus and K9 Advantix II on him in the past but try to use it sparingly as he has white fur and his skin seems really sensitive. However we moved this past year to a new house that is pretty far out in the country, lots of wild animals & deer wander around our yard and the back of our lot is wooded so I know that fleas & ticks are much more likely to be hanging around here than our previous home (and with indoor kitties I REALLY want to be sure we don't bring in fleas) so I picked this up to use with him, hoping to save a few bucks but still get great treatment.So far so good, he didn't have any sort of skin reaction (I do apply it all along his spine... he's not super flexible in his old age so I don't worry about him licking it and I keep him away from the cats for 24hrs after application to make sure it doesn't get on anything they might lick either) and knock on wood he's still free of fleas & ticks. I'll update this as the season progresses if we see any unwanted critters but so far so good!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMYZG5PWURBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2COPM#wasThisHelpful","RCMYZG5PWURBF","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love fall, and yet I despise leaves... at least once they fall to the ground. We don't have all that many of our own trees on our property however there is some weird vortex thing going on with our street and I swear to you the entire streets leaves end up on our lawn (this also happens with snow!) Both neighbors on either side of us will have hardly a single leaf and my lawn will be covered even though our main tree hasn't lost a single one yet... it makes me CRAZY. I'm also however cheap and hate paying a lawn service to clean up... racking is awful. Bagging is horrible. My husband and I would argue about who was going to do it every single year. Then I discovered the original model of this... I ordered one immediately and tried it out as soon as it arrived. I was THRILLED. Sure, it didn't do a great job on wet leaves, and the side zipper was a huge pain in the butt to empty and I almost always got the chopped up leaf gunk all over me but it was still awesome, because I didn't have to rake much (piling up leaves with a quick raking does make it go faster as does loosening any that are maybe damp on the bottom and would otherwise want to stick to the ground) but best part was no arm fulls of dirty buggy leaves to try and bag.When I saw this model with the changes (the main one I cared about was the zipper is now on the bottom of the bag) I grabbed it, only thing better than using one of these is having my husband and I both have one so we can get it down 2x as fast. It hasn't disappointed. It's MUCH easier to empty the bag now (I actually need to see if I can order a 2nd new style bag for our original one) and this model seems to do a better job with damp leaves too.All in all I absolutely love this vac (I really never use it for a blower, we have a lawn service that cuts the grass and I hate when people blow their leaves around, since like I mentioned they always end up on MY lawn) but I'm sure it works great as the vacuum feature is wonderful!Side note, they aren't very heavy, and the strap makes them comfortable to ""wear"" across your body, they are however really loud so you might want to wear some ear protection & also watch out for sticks/large twigs as they can jam it up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDQNREQM2V5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNCJU3E#wasThisHelpful","R1HDQNREQM2V5K","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Typically these cases are a total pain. I keep one in my car or purse for emergency use but never ever just leave it on the phone as they are usually huge/heavy/ugly and make it impossible to charge/sync my iPhone.This case is 100% different from all other battery cases I've owned. It's really easy to get my newest phone in and out, however I find myself leaving it on far more often then I take it off.

"If you can get your hands on the packaging pictured (the gold zip top bag) GRAB THEM  UP, those are a 5 star product. My cat who gets frequent bladder infections loved them and they were the only thing that helped her (when even antibiotics couldn't). We recently ordered a new package and were surprised to see a packaging change, they now arrive in what looks like a small icecream cup. Immediately I could tell something was different since they are much harder, not at all a ""soft chew"" like we were used to. I gave one to my cat and she bit at it a bit, looked at me and starting meowing nonstop.

"I'm THRILLED with this purchase. I've been doing my own gel nails (mostly with Gelish) for over a year now, first using the Gelish branded 6 watt lamp (which lasted me maybe 6 months, so only around 10 uses) then I purchased a twin for it here on Amazon (another little 6 watt) which is still working fine but never seemed to really cure all the way (I'd have a bit of color on the wipe after curing sometimes) so when I saw how affordable this one was, and that I could actually fit my whole hand (seriously, this alone is enough to make it great... I was sick of having to do my thumbs separately from my other 4 fingers) I jumped at the chance to buy it.It arrived yesterday and I used it for the first time. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I used a dark turquoise and had no color transfer at all after curing. I was a bit worried about the beep (I do my nails after my little one is in bed) but it isn't overly loud. The timers worked perfectly and being able to do a whole hand at once, awesome!My nails look great, I have no doubt they are fully cured. I've seen some concern about the lack of mirrors inside however given the number of leds and their placement I don't think mirrors are going to make a difference. If you really wanted them I'd imagine you could get some small ones froma craft store and glue them in there, I opted to get the white lamp assuming it would reflect light the best.... so that's something else that may or may not make a difference vs getting the black version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJ70UGQNNKL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S81WTFW#wasThisHelpful","RKJ70UGQNNKL1","A3R7RE5O61M112","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7RE5O61M112?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have enjoyed Susan's books for a number of years-I have all of the cookbooks and other books she has written and illustrated.  I like them because they are bright, happy and full of hope and enjoyment of life.  I think we all can use that.  I was not quite sure what the Fairy Tale Girl would bring but I was excited to read about the wonderful woman behind the scenes....I was not disappointed.  She uses her diaries from when she was in her 20's and fleshes out the earlier years full of all the things that you do and then look back and wonder how you ever got through it all and became ""mature"", whatever that is.....maybe I (and she) still don't know.  She never loses her sense of fun and adventure and is not afraid to pull back the curtain on more painful times in her life and that is why you love the book.  It is like sitting down and listening to a girlfriend.  It is handwritten and illustrated as all her books and I devoured it in a weekend then was very sad that it will be mid next year before I can get the second one....I wish I had made it last a bit longer.Susan is a breath of fresh air and brings a brightness and coziness to her writings that I just want to cuddle up to and enjoy like a present.If you haven't already read her books, grab a cookbook and this first book and become an instant fan!  5 stars all the way!I","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMDHWEQSF8AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996044019#wasThisHelpful","R2XMDHWEQSF8AR","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We replaced our old feeder with this beautiful red glass feeder.  It is very elegant looking and is easy to fill, bright and pretty.  We have already seen the hummers, who come around quite frequently come and feed at the new feeder.  I'm not quite sure if there is any extra traffic in comparison to the clear glass feeder we had, but they are drinking from it, so I think they like it too!  I would say the only drawback is that because the glass is red that it is a bit harder to tell if the feeder is getting low, but overall, lovely design and a hit with the birds.

"A good sounding  power amp with multiple inputs and a wired remote controlI wanted something to power our high quality (B&W) ceiling mounted kitchen speakers along with the patio speakers that had multiple inputs, Blue Tooth (BT) capability, and a wired remote control. We have a special power supply (takes in 120 VAC and puts out 13.8 VDC) which allows this unit to be used in a home environment (if you look for one if these, make sure they are Underwriters Labs, UL, certified).We found this little amp with all the features we needed and a few extra - there are a pair of RCA inputs - for connecting to a line in from a receiver (or Ipod) and a line out (for connected a separate amp or sub woofer output amp). The wired remote control allows you to switch between the wired RCA inputs and the Wireless Blue Tooth.There is even a USB (5V @ 1amp) charging port - which will charge most phones without any issues. Our Samsung S5's reported the connection to be lower power - but proceeded to charge anyway.It's all about that watts? (sorry, Megan :-(  ). Is is really 125 watt/channel?  um,  Possibly!  - But if it were that much, it would sound like your vacuum cleaner running on hardwood floors! You see, the unit only draws 15 amps (protected by a 15 amp fuse) and runs on 13.8vDC (auto voltage when your engine is charging the battery). That is only a 208 watts total power into the unit. There is always some looses in converting all the power to what we hear in the music. What would you expect to get out of this power amp? The numbers tell the story - 208 watts in probably produces with the Class AB design somewhere in the 20 - 25 watt range with minimal distortion (what is distortion? That is when you turn up the volume so loud is becomes garbled :-(  ). What is it good for ? Lots! This is great amp to have an a truck to power a pair of speakers mounted the shell for the tail gate parties - all control able from your phone. Will this work in a car with 4 speakers - yes ! You can even connect a sub-woofer amp (not included) to this amp (Line Out)  - so you, too, will hear 'All about that BASS'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNXG89IDWAS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV6YOTU#wasThisHelpful","R3DNXG89IDWAS3","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just looking at the picture I knew that I would probably like the top for yoga and hanging out but wasn't sure about the back of the top.  I tried it on, and though I would have preferred a top that was the same front and back, my husband liked the unusual back detail.  The fit is as expected, the sleeves are nice and long with a gather and the top is well fitted, with a perfect scoop neck that is not too low.  The cut is flattering and is fitted.Overall, I do love the shirt, for me I would wear to do yoga/walking etc, but would not wear as a casual shirt because of the back detail....not sure why, but I just wouldn't.  Big marks from my husband.  He loved it.  The one holdback on this one is the price.  Over 50.00 for this shirt is a little on the expensive side, so while I do like the shirt, I would not go out and purchase this at that price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5G54T94CLN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U359JF4#wasThisHelpful","R3M5G54T94CLN1","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have gotten a couple necklaces from the collection and after wearing them would have to say I always love the pendant piece but am not super-jazzed with the chain.  It looks so much prettier with a chain of a little higher quality that also doesn't tangle quite so easy.

"What a great find this book is!  My husband especially loves the old west and he was fascinated by this book and was excited to have it as a reference book.  Filled with pictures and timelines and those historical figures that shaped the old west it is a treasure trove of information.The book has an intro covering the Louisiana purchase and then goes to Westward Expansion from 1803-1846, The Mexican War and Gold Rush 1846-1861, Preserving the Union and Spanning the Continent 1861-1869, War for the Plains 1870-1879,Law and Disorder 1880-1889 and the Last Frontiers 1890-1912.  Though perfect to just thumb through, I plan to read up and learn (or should I say re-learn) about the old west.  This book really hits it out of the park-beautifully done.

"My husband rarely wears a fragrance, but I kind of liked when he used to have a little something on when we had a night out, so we gave the Burberry Brit Rhythm a try.  I don't know what exactly makes this a young or edgy fragrance, I think it is just a nice smell.  I read what it was supposed to smell like and really couldn't say it smelled like one note overtook the rest or that it had a strong scent of one particular thing.  It smelled a little like wood/cedar to me and I thought it was a nice blend.  It was not too heavy-handed on the fragrance and tended to stay on when he wore it.  Overall, I think it is nice and would love to have him wear it occasionally.  He thought it smelled good, though it didn't seem like a real ""wow"" factor for him.  Nice packaging, good fragrance and stayed on.  May purchase again, depending on whether he gravitates to wearing it more often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TL94U24R7C8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVTH9PK#wasThisHelpful","R1TL94U24R7C8T","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book.  I'm a long time fan of Karin Slaughters books and have read them all, but I didn't enjoy the book.  The level of violence in this book to me was way over the top, and I read mostly thrillers.  The writing was good, but after I finished the novel I found myself with images in my head that I would have preferred not to have there.  The book centers around a family where the oldest daughter goes missing and the aftermath of the family that is left behind.  Other girls also go missing and are about the same age with the same basic look.  Let's just say there are ties and that all that you see with the family is not quite as it seems.For me I was a bit sickened by the torture and the psychopath behind the torture, etc.I was more than happy when the book ended, and though it was a satisfying (as much as it could be) ending I walked away from the book wondering if I had missed something, since the book had so much praise.I would say if you don't want to read about torture or have a weak stomach you should pass this up.  I am a fan, and will read her books again, especially in the Grant County series, but I honestly wished I had passed this one up.

"With these being an XL size I thought these were perfect my husband who does a lot of wood working and related garage projects.  I actually tried these as well to see how they would work for doing dishes.  A little big on me, but gripped a dish quite nicely and were heavier than I had expected.  Definitely not flimsy or the kind of glove that you would think would be single use.

"This is a lovely watch.  Now a couple things....if you are just looking at the picture it is difficult to really picture the face on this-it is large/oversized.  I like it a lot when I wear something dressy and I love the mother of pearl face.  Very pretty and feminine.  The watchband has an easy release and it is very easy to put on by clasping one side and then the other.  My one disappointment was how seemingly huge this was as delivered.  You will invariably find yourself at the mall or watch repair shop to have links taken out.  I read a review where someone had three taken out and I thought it totally didn't apply to me.  I am not waif-like in the least and my wrist is just under 6"".  I had to have 2 links taken out and it ran me about $20.00.  I felt that wasn't much to pay but if you shell full price for the watch and then find yourself adding another 20.00 to the tab you might be unhappy, so I'm just disclosing that piece if your wrist may be a similar size.  I wear mine snug with just a tad bit of room and two links was perfect.  I love the quality and the look and that it is different than my more dainty everyday watch.  It is a nice switch up.  The face is easy to read and has a pink second hand which could come in handy.Overall, very pleased with the watch and extremely pleased once I had the watch correctly sized.  I might have liked this a tad bit more with a different band, but I do really like it and it would make a very nice gift, coming in a beautiful box and well secured with it's own little pillow to make sure it makes the trip to the recipient unscathed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UL2JFSICSOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADSGV34#wasThisHelpful","R25UL2JFSICSOF","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read quite a few books in the last few years about happiness and what Christine Carter calls ""finding the sweet spot"", that point where you feel that you are functioning at a peak level and you are happy.  I feel like her book resounded with me because she seems to struggle with the same thing we all do.  Finding time, finding energy and figuring out how to find that happy balance.  Don't get me wrong, this is not ground breaking information, but it is highly usable information, that sometimes you forget when you are in a rush in your hustle and bustle of life.  I disagree with some of the comments that this is just focused towards people who have kids or who work at a job where they don't have the luxury of taking more breaks, it is about being present.  She gives a wealth of ideas and some of them will be for you and some won't work in your situation.  No book can cover it all and be relevant for everyone.  I'd love to be able to take a 10 minute break every 90 minutes or so, but it isn't really feasible with my job, but I can work on more taxing things for a stretch and do something that is a little lighter on the brain power for a little while or go to another department to handle business in person instead of emailing.  I can adapt the information to what I CAN do.  I may not have time for ""recess"" but I do have to eat lunch and I can tack on 10 minutes to meditate (I tried the app she uses: Headspace and love it!...).  I can set up more things as a habit so I don't have to use a lot of brain power on menial things and use my brain when I really need it.  I can work at being kinder and more patient.  I felt that this book had a lot of great ideas.  I actually read a library copy and I convinced my husband to buy a kindle copy because I think it is a book you can use by someone who has also struggled to ""find the sweet spot"".I also loved her humor, energy and honesty in her writing.  To me she was very easy to relate to.Overall, I thought this was a very good book and I have already recommended to a few people.  I think with any book of this type you will maybe not be able to adopt all of the practices in every circumstance, but you will find those that ring true for you and for those gems this book was a worthwhile read for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M1X6WD90NNZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392042#wasThisHelpful","R3M1X6WD90NNZ7","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've decorated with tips before but this was my first try with using the recipe to make royal icing, which seemed to come out a little wetter than expected which I attribute to my newbiehood in this area.

I did love the ease of using the bottles, which I thought was easier than a pastry bag which always seems a little messy for me and clean up was a breeze as the bottles can be flipped inside out and are supposedly fine to put in the dishwasher, though I decided to hand wash.  You get two bottles, the couplers, and six assorted tips.  I really like the idea of these and it will be fun to work on perfecting my technique but the hubby is willing to help me eat any of the mistakes, so its all good.  With a little practice I should be making fantastic cupcakes by spring!Overall, great idea, compact set and a good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPFE3K9BQHDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X382O#wasThisHelpful","R2IPFE3K9BQHDX","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year when I buy or am given a diary or travel journal I wish that that someone would get wise and put a pocket in the journal for all of my small treasures that I want to keep safe, ie: ticket stubs, pressed flowers, little notes, and other scraps of life.  These little pockets are amazing.  I have put them in my every day journal and my travel journal and never again will be coveting a diary with that detail.  These are sturdy plastic with a closure that keeps everything safe and there is room to right on the front of the pouch.  The possibilities are endless.  I plan to keep a couple of these on hand so I can keep all my mini-treasures safe and secure with my journals.

"So, there a couple reasons why I decided to try this roller.  I like a nice massage to my back muscles after sitting in my cubicle all day and my husband has tight hamstrings and also has a desk job.  I found in trying the small pamphlet of exercises that was included in the roller that this is an item that you have to gear to what you need/want.  The roller is medium intensity on the muscles, it might be a little too intense for some.  You do have to be semi-coordinated in order to me laying on the roller for the back rolling so this also might not be for everyone.  My dad tried it out as he had shoulder surgery years ago and does exercises to keep his shoulders supple and used the roller up and down the wall for mobility and thought it was great.  I liked it for my back a lot, but not probably as much as sitting in my chair with the shiatsu roller going up and down my back.  Overall, the number of reps that are suggested are just that, a suggestion.  You should use this item carefully and stop when you feel you have done enough.Would I buy it?  I don't know that I feel it is an absolute must have, but it is a nice tool to help massage out those points that tend to hold tension and if you aren't lucky enough to have a massage cushion for a chair and you don't mind doing a little work, this may be just the ticket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLHOCK2ECVDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPGLJTI#wasThisHelpful","R3NLHOCK2ECVDP","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lots of pockets for phones, train/transit passes, wallet and enough space for laptop or kindle.  Manyly enough for a guy and not too masculine for a woman.

"I always look forward to the Rizzoli & Isles books, they always have tight plot lines and I love to revisit the characters.  This one was good but was not as good as some of her previous novels.  I didn't feel like it was quite as tense and edge of your seat as usual, but it was still a good read.This book starts off on a bush safari in Botswana that goes horribly awry, with the vacationers apparently being hunted and killed.  As they are slowly picked off the members of the group start to doubt that their trusty guide Johnny may be the culprit and they are unsure where to turn and to whom they can trust.  The secondary story fast forwards about six years where a semi-famous game hunter is found gutted and hanging upside down as a kill.  As the story unfolds there are similarities and coincidences that intersect between the two stories and you realize that some of these characters may not be who you think they are.I wasn't quite as taken with the story line and it take me a little longer to read than normal just because I thought it was a good story but not one I couldn't put down.  As always though, she does write a good novel and for those that love the characters it is nice to revisit them once again.This book is a series, so I do not recommend jumping in if you haven't already read previous books, but for fans of the series it is a pretty good addition to the series even if it isn't maybe the best in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O0FVMGYUV2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345543858#wasThisHelpful","R6O0FVMGYUV2W","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not necessarily a movie for everyone.  Let me explain the premise....April lives in a small NY apartment and is the black sheep of the family.  She and her boyfriend are hosting Thanksgiving for the first time and what might be her mom's last Thanksgiving as she has cancer.  I know, sounds like a downer and not a comedy, right?  Well, depends on your perspective.  When this came out we had started to deal with my mom's cancer and mom watched it with me and we could definitely relate to the mom's wicked sense of humor and not wanting to be handled like a breakable object.  She even stops the car at one point to advise the family that they will all have to come to grips with how they will deal with....(see everyone's grief stricken faces).....April's lack of cooking skills and how they will hide and get rid of the food.....Meanwhile back at April's apartment her boyfriend, Bobby has gone out to do some errands and she finds that she does not have a working oven so she roams the hallways with her turkey trying to find someone that will let her cook the turkey in their oven.  She obviously knows no one in the building, so it is hilarious as she goes from the family that can't speak English, a Vegan that says she wants to speak with her alone)....so April leaves the turkey on the floor in it's pan.... and the African American couple who open their home for a brief time and school her in the evils of canned cranberry sauce.I disagree that there isn't humor, the movie has many funny moments but some humor is a little on the dark side.  It is about trying to reconcile, living in the moment and dealing with the cards that life deals you.  After mom and I first watched this it became our quirky tradition to watch around Thanksgiving most years.  I still love it!Overall, not for everyone, but definitely had great acting, lots of humor and a heartfelt story line, but if you are looking for a laugh a minute and light hearted fun, this would definitely not be for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V41U1LWFHT21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VV4OK#wasThisHelpful","R1V41U1LWFHT21","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, these are a little different....they are little squares of fruit and nut, about the size of a small crouton, so I could see these marketed for salads.  Not sure, I might use them in a salad...  They are also good out of the bag just for a little snack.  I think I might like these not in the square shape, maybe as just small clusters or something, but as far as the taste, they are a nice balance of fruit and nut. I doubt I'd eat on fruit but maybe I'd mix into yogurt or have with ice cream if I got the strawberry flavor.Overall, a nice taste, but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to purchase for a salad, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBQI5JM8PDBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SL2OV0#wasThisHelpful","RPBQI5JM8PDBJ","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be honest....I don't know if I saw these in the store if I would have tried them.  Sweet and spicy bars with a bunch of nuts....eh, not so much.  I was, however a bit intrigued and somehow thought I should give them a try.  I was surprised that I liked them, but I did.  They have a sweet/spicy flavor that is akin to bbq sauce and are full of peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, raisins and coconut.  The spice comes from ground chipotle chile, so they have a nice smoky flavor.  This bar is non-gmo, gluten free, soy free and dairy free, for those that need to know.These bars I definitely would buy again, they are flavorful, nutty, chewy and delicious.  One bar is 160 calories with 80 calories from fat and 2 g of saturated fat.  There are 8 g of sugar and 3 g of fiber.  Calcium comes in at 2% with 4% Iron.If you need a snack you don't have to feel too bad about, with good fat from nuts and a yummy bbq flavor, this may be the ticket.Overall, my husband and I both enjoyed these and would purchase again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRU0NNDFGCYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUG1D0I#wasThisHelpful","RNRU0NNDFGCYS","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably not my 1st choice for a novel to listen on audio since I usually gravitate toward mysteries and thrillers, but I was at the end of my book when this became available and I thought I'd give it a listen.  I'm so glad that I did!!!  What a well written and interesting book!The book starts with an old woman that is moving from her Oregon Coast home to an assisted living center.  She is suffering from terminal cancer and goes through the story of her life from the time she was growing up in a small town in France after the death of her mother through world war 2 and what happens to her and her family during the occupation.The book centers around Viann and Isabel, who come of age during world war 2 and the German occupation.  Viann is a young wife with a small daughter whose husband is called to war.  She is the responsible daughter who tries to do the right thing and play by the rules, unlike her sister, Isabel who has gotten kicked out of every school and convent that she attends and feels rules are made to be broken.The war takes them in very different directions as Viann's house is taken over by a Nazi soldier and Isabel becomes an aid in the Resistance.The book occasionally peeks back to the present day, but basically is the story of the two sisters and their family and friends during the occupation.I found there were lots of twists and the last several disks really kept the plot moving.  I was moved and very satisfied with the book.  It was not necessarily an upbeat story, but a story about survival and the ties we have with our family and friends and what we do to survive.What a satisfying book this was.  I was actually sorry to see it end and found myself listening much longer than I usually will with a book on disk.  Also I must add that Polly Stone the reader is excellent and really gives the story a voice (literally and figuratively).Overall, a very good book, well told and moving.  I would definitely recommend and will also be seeking out more books from this author to see if I chance upon another gem like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJNMGSZH5GUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1427212678#wasThisHelpful","RJJNMGSZH5GUJ","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hubby and I were excited to try these bars and are now wondering if there is a way to show less than a star in the review.First the pros:  Lovely wrapper.....(yeah, that's all we could come up with).Cons:  This is the oddest bar we have ever tried.  It had a very weird consistency like a bar made of 10 lbs of playdough dyed an unbecoming color that looks like it could have come from....well, lets not get gross here....it was an unbecoming color that you would expect from someone eating something unpleasant....nuff said.The taste-I have not seen my husband make this face before and I was afraid it would stick that way.  He almost wiped his tongue off with his hands rapidly to get the taste off.  I am sure I mirrored this as I felt the same.  It looked like taffy, tasted like peanut butter and playdough and had a weird after taste that I can't seem to pinpoint (nor do I want to).I understand that these bars are ""the bar"" of Tough Mudder-an endurance race for crazy-fit people.  Good for them for being able to stomach these.....Overall, NOOOOOOOO!  Would not purchase these even for my husband who is one who has done cross-fit and eats right.  These had no redeeming value for us....","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQX7EA8QYMAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6X0LM#wasThisHelpful","R1TQX7EA8QYMAN","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This clamp takes a little time to get used to as it requires a little closer tolerance to engage the clamping mechanism than a standard clamp does.  Think of this little baby as a cross between a traditional clamp and a vise grip....in that once you are able to get it close to clamping, you can squeeze the vise grip to lock it down.  You can adjust the clamping  pressure with the small adjustment knob on the inside of the tool.  All and all a very solid tool, good materials and easy to use.

"Here is the review on what we like to call the Handyman's Toy bag....(this review is from my hubby that is actually using these tools to help redesign our bathroom),  this man knows his tools....(just sayin').....And here is the review.....The Power Saw:A great saw with the right balance between power and weight for most field jobs.My tests were done with the mid range battery pack, the 2 amp hr. The balance with this pack installed was a good fit for guiding the saw through the material. I tested it with few old first generation growth fir 2x4's with the stock blade. Next it was on to some plywood, 3/4"" cabinet grade - about 10'. The stock blade tracked the guide line with out a lot of correction - I will probably switch out the blade for a cabinet grade 40 tooth version to reduce tear-out on higher quality woods. The safety lock and the blade brake make this a excellent saw for all around work. Lets face it, we all get tired and work past our point of safety (""The one last cut rule"") and having these features will probably save some fingers and thighs. It is a great complement to a 1800 watt electric saw, when there is no power around or you just don't want to dig out the extension cord.The Impact driver:Why do you need an impact driver? Think of it like putting all your muscle into just keeping the screw going into the wood - without it bouncing out and damaging the wall. The impact driver is like using a hammer and a screw driver at the same time - it pounds away at the screw while twisting it into position - all you have to do is keep the impact driver on the screw head. This is a tremendous assistance for working with long deck screws or driving them into hard woods. I have been able to drive 3"" deck screws into construction - grade 2x4's from an up-side-down position (don't ask :-) ) without having the bit jump out of the screw head. Try that with a standard drill/driver and you'll find that the bit bounces out of the head - causing you to stop and reset the bit into the screw head. Driving these babies home in one shot was a huge time saver (and I was able to keep the peaceful zen in the house on Sunday morning.. namaste).However, this is NOT a quiet tool, due to its hammering ability - it sounds like a woody-woodpecker on steroids when the hammer mechanism is engagedThis is a well balanced tool for one handed operation with the 2 a/hr battery installed.The DrillI really like the tri-LED light on the front on the tool - that stays on after the drilling is finished. This is a big help when trying to work in low light level areas. I also like the trigger control and the where the fwd/rev switch is located - they were easy to operate and stayed in position even during rough drilling (try drilling with a 7/8"" spade bit into two 2x4's - better hold on tight, an let it cool down when done!). The chuck locks into place and holds on about as good as the Jacobs replacement chucks. The variable speed option maintained the proper torque need to keep the bit spinning in the hole when drilling into deeper material (yes, they would really tap the battery). All in all - this is a great drill  with a good balance between power and weight. It might be a little heavy for some with the optional 5 amp/hr battery installed (only the 2 amp/hr comes with the kit - you get two of them).The Light:I took it out to the yard the other night and was able to light up the phone pole on the adjacent street - which is about 100 ft away. It produces a narrow beam - for distance - and a fairly wide corona (the area around the center beam of light) for working in tighter locations. I found it cool to rotate the head to any one of 11 positions (indexing) within 120 deg rotation and have it stay there - this is just what I need when working on hanging up the Christmas decorations or fixing something where you need light to stay.Being LED is won't suck down the battery if you've left it on while working under house and forgot to turn it off. It is plenty bright at 110 lumens (what does that really mean in terms of useful light? Plenty of it, AT the right color spectrum, and at anywhere you want to point it!).The Bag:Hey, you've got to have 'more places for your stuff' - is what dear ole' George usta say - so, pickup your toys and put them in the bag .. so you too can be a bag ""person"" (but with cool tools :-) ) The bag is very well constructed and a great place to keep all your new tools in one location.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBTHIIWX2Y5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHBZ9AA#wasThisHelpful","R2EBTHIIWX2Y5J","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not normally a buyer of a lot of different face products.  I try to cleanse well and make sure I moisturize and use sunscreen, which I normally prefer as part of my moisturizing routine.  I have started using this but really only at night since I don't want to add sunscreen on top of this for day wear and am happy with my normal product.  This is pleasant, and light.  Actually, a bit lighter than I would expect, I expected something a little thicker.  The smell I expected to be more apple like but it was more of a citrus scent, but nice, nonetheless.  I would say this has done a nice job on my skin making it feel soft and may have eased a few fine lines but I don't know that I feel it is worth the price that is charged.  It might also work even better with their other products but I am not looking for a cleanser, and serum AND a moisturizer (thanks, I have other hobbies besides my face....).

"We buy bars like this quite often but the difference in these is that they actually boast a 1/4 c. of veggies in each bar, which is not too shabby.  We aren't talking brussel sprouts here, so don't get judgy.....the add ins are carrots and sweet potatoes.  I also had the hubby try the bar and he LOVED them and said they are perfect when he goes walking.  I liked them, but didn't feel there was enough peanut butter taste, although they were good and when I got over the PB thing I could like them on their own accord.  They are 210 calories and you get as much fiber as 2c. of kale from what the box states.  Again, not too bad.

"I went to a corporate event recently where they tossed these out and I thought, ""Wow, I think this would be so cool for Halloween...."".  Well, I was right, in fact so much so that I had kids that wanted to know if they could just take two bracelets and almost forgot we were also giving candy (good stuff....we're not talking raisins here...).  Anyway, we had a couple duds, but overall the sticks were all aglow and the kids had a great time picking a bracelet....Boys and girls little kids, tweens or teens.  It was pretty much a hit with our best response from two tweens who commented this was the best house that they'd been to all night.  (Ok we have cool pumpkins too, but they LOVED these...).  So, we felt good.  The kids got a nice treat and we also lit them up a little so they were more visible along our busy street.  I would definitely purchase again.  Easy to assemble by breaking the stick, shaking and putting a connector at the end.  I thought they'd be a hit, but the kids really liked something different and a little out of the ordinary.  Our tube came with an assortment of colors, orange, yellow, red, green purple, pink.

"This bar was a bit of a surprise.  When I first saw it I thought ""who on earth would eat this?"".....then I kind of became interested in trying it out.....So I tried the one bar that amazon sent and had the hubby give it a go too and I would have to liken it more to when you buy flavored nuts in a can....you can buy bbq, wasabi, etc.  You know, savory flavors....same deal here, but they are in a bar.  Kind of ingenious actually.  So, we both enjoyed the honey smoked BBQ and I have to say I would buy a box of these, great when you want something salty with a tinge of sweetness from the honey BBQ.  Nice smoky flavor, just about all nuts, nice texture and chewy.  You have to go into trying these with an open mind.  It kind of seems weird since they usually do more of a chewy granola bar, but if you taste it like you would flavored nuts I think you will be quite surprised and pleased.Overall, I was really surprised I liked the bar and would definitely purchase.

"This is the 10th Sigma Force Novel and as with the others, they are full of thrills, conspiracy and scientific.  Sometimes it is a little hard to follow some of the science speak, but overall, Rollins puts out a great thriller.  The premise is that the earth is heading towards its 6th extinction and Gray Pierce and his team are to help discover what is happening and how they may be able to stop it.  The story opens as a mayday is sent from a military research station in Northern California near the town of Bodie.  The person making the call advises them that they must ""kill us all"".  The call brings about a chain of events that take the team to Antarctica, where there are hidden secrets that they must uncover, to Brazil and back to the site.As always, there is technology at the center of the story and the work can either be for the good of mankind or towards the 6th extinction if it falls into the wrong hands.Your favorite characters are once again back in the stories, Painter Crowe, Gray Pierce and Kowalski and Monk among others, so those of you familiar with the series will enjoy seeing these characters once again in the thick of things.  If this is your first novel, it is not necessary that you read the others, but it does give you a better handle on the characters.  As I was enjoying this so much my husband purchased the kindle version and enjoyed it just as much even though he had just been introduced to the characters.Overall, another thrill ride from Rollins that won't disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKGW8O3YUSXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061784818#wasThisHelpful","R3RKGW8O3YUSXB","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several OXO products for my kitchen and decided to give this a try.  I had a very old plastic canister that I used for my baking mix, it had the recipes from the manufacturer for making waffles and pancakes and so I kept it and kept it until the lid tore a bit and then it was time to move on.  I now have this canister and it works great-see through, so you can immediately see how much you have left and a top that pops up with a press of the lid.  The handle side has indents so you know which end to pour from.  It is well made and I taped my recipes to the front so now I have a brand new container that is 100% times better than before and still have the ease of having my recipe right on the container.  This would be great for cereal, snacks for the kids, goldfish crackers or anything else that you want to store tightly and be able to pour out easily.I would definitely purchase this if I needed more and would recommend to family/friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROK4EAZYHDB0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X4ZAI#wasThisHelpful","ROK4EAZYHDB0R","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I currently have a bright pink carry-on that I sometimes check and sometimes use as a carryon and love the bright color, even though I'm not a kid-hey, why do the kids get all the cool, bright colored fun stuff?  I would have to say this would be a great suitcase for a car trip or as a carry-on for a kid or a woman with a fun streak who likes to have snazzy travel accessories.  I am not sure if this would do well as a check in piece of luggage as I'm not sure if it could withstand any rough handling.  You can definitely feel a ""give"" if you press on it, so it is semi-hard sided.  It is well organized with little pockets within and gives you plenty of room.  I would caution on the suitcase cover that it is flim-sy.  It did not fit over the suitcase easily and I actually pushed my finger straight through it, so if you use that I caution you to do so gingerly.  It is made of a very light reusable shopping bag type of material....not a great choice to cover a suitcase, or to fit so snugly.I LOVE the colors and it rolls great and has the handle at the top that collapses or on the side if you need to pick your suitcase up.  I like it because it is different and will be perfect for a weekend away.Overall, I would not use necessarily as a check-in, but would be a great little suitcase for a weekend away or as a carry-on for your next trip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354B8CLY5X5JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPC4B8E#wasThisHelpful","R354B8CLY5X5JP","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I received this CD as a gift  and we love it!  I was under the impression it was country, but it really is so much more than that.  Some of the tunes reminded me of Patsy Cline, but then I'd hear another and it reminded me of the group Pink Martini.  We played this back to back a few times.  You can find my fave ""Bad for You"" and it's clever video on youtube and get a sampling of Carolyn Sills.  I must say, normally, I don't gravitate to a lot of female singers that are designated as ""country"", but again, she has a much wider range, with a real talent, she most likely could sing just about any genre and sound amazing-what a find!  I'm now hoping that I'll find that they will be somewhere in town soon so we could experience the Combo live.  Great tunes and a really pleasant surprise!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYJYQ32M9N4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKS6SDO#wasThisHelpful","RTYJYQ32M9N4S","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always in need of a good apron and when the hubby and I cook together it is nice to have an apron that is unisex so we can just grab one and get to cooking..... This apron is very long, I am just under 5'7 and it came below my knees by a couple inches, The top adjusts as does a normal apron and there is a small gap it the front, though nothing big.  The top of the apron does come up higher and that is nice considering that a splash up or spill can occur in that area too.  The pockets , two divided in the front came up quite high, but I rarely use a pocket in my apron, so that is not anything that is a big deal either.  I love the feel of this apron!  It is extremely soft and doesn't seem to hold wrinkles quite as much as regular linen, as I have just put it on again after it was folded up tightly and put in a drawer.  It is machine washable and you can iron if that is your thing....me?  I'm in the kitchen not strolling around wearing an apron and entertaining, so, good to know, but won't be ironing this....I also tried this out on the hubby and it fit him nicely as well with a little less gap at the top.  I did find that for the fit to be right for me I had to adjust the top pretty significantly which left a long ""tail"", you can just let it hang, or if that bugs you just flip it behind your neck to the other side.Overall, a nice apron, good quality, nice packaging, all tied up with a little bit of twine and would make a thoughtful gift for the cook.  Though mine is the light brown model with the stripe I would love this in one of the bright patterns.  They are gorgeous!I would definitely would consider purchasing either for myself or as a gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0ITN0L7EN9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3C9LQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3M0ITN0L7EN9V","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Sandford and have read all of his Prey & Virgil Flower novels and was interested in seeing what this YA (young adult) would bring to the table.  It's an interesting premise, with the two main characters being Shay & Odin Remby, two extremely bright teens who have bounced around from foster home to foster home when their parents die in their 30's in two separate events leaving them orphaned.  Shay is the semi-responsible one and Odin is a hacker who has joined a group of animal rights activists to hit a company called Singular and bring to light their experiments which do not appear to be all that the company claims they are.  Shay is drawn into her brother's world when he gives her the thumb drives he steals and a lab dog that has had some unspeakable tests done on it.And the chase is on.......the company continues to stalk her brother and kidnaps him and Shay is on the run, along with some friends and the owner of a homeless youth hotel, who is an activist and goes by the name of ""Twist"".Overall, a good read and I will most likely pick up the 2nd installment as this is a start of a series.  The characters are interesting and the plot unfolds quickly.For those that are wondering the difference between Sandfords's YA novel I can't really say, the language may be a little tamer, but overall it reads just like an adult novel with the exception being your main two characters are teens.  This would be enjoyed by an adult or teen in my opinion, so don't shy away because it is packaged as a YA novel.  Some of the best stuff out there is geared to kids....","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VRDQDWBID6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385753063#wasThisHelpful","R38VRDQDWBID6D","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty decent toothpaste overall but I can't say that I will be changing to this brand.  I currently use Crest with scope and I like the taste better than the icy, which is a little more in your face with the mint flavor.  As far as whitening in a week, I would say it does about the same as my regular brand, it cleans and whitens some but not anything out of the ordinary for any of the whitening toothpastes.  To be fair though, I do drink coffee and red wine, so I don't expect miracles in an over the counter toothpaste.

It is light on green tea flavor and you have to love mint, but for those that do it is really refreshing.  I am very pleased with this tea, which is also organic.  I plan to purchase the 6 boxes because between hubby, me and work I think the price also can't be beat.

"It is always difficult to read a description of perfume because everyone's chemistry is a little different.  I think that is the case with this eau de toilette.  My attention was drawn to the product for a few reasons, it is a good brand, I like citrusy/fruity scents and am willing to try something new.At first spray I was a little disappointed because it definitely smelled more woodsy, like sandlewood with a little vanilla, but as I sniffed my wrist throughout the day I found that by the end of the day it took on a more citrus scent, not sharp by any means, but moreso than when I first sprayed it on.  It stays on all day and I would say it is a pretty smell.  No one note really takes over, so it it seems to have many layers to it and is a more sophisticated/elegant scent.My husband tends to like fruit/citrus scents on me the most but said he thought this was a pretty feminine scent and not overpowering, just right in his words.Overall, I enjoy the perfume and have worn it for a few days now.  It won't take the place of my favorites, but it definitely has a place in my perfume rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIFPN5Z732NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089HGSMK#wasThisHelpful","RUIFPN5Z732NN","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've read all of Karin Slaughters previous novels and couldn't wait for her first stand-alone novel.  Again, she doesn't disappoint.  The book takes us back to Atlanta circa 1974.  Maggie Lawson follows her brother and Uncle into the force and she is a tough as nails cop, trying to overcome the boy's club atmosphere of the force at that time.  She is shocked when she finds that her brother's partner has been killed by a shooter they believe has targeted pairs of cops called to bogus crime scenes.  Though relieved that he has survived the incident evidence that is put together seem to bring about more questions than answers.  Maggie is also saddled with a new female rookie, Kate Murphy, who is a young widow from a privileged upbringing.  She not only is taking the heat from the men, but also from the women and other minorities on the force.  Though extremely green she starts to put information together with a fresh unbiased eye but is not sure how to get her new colleagues to look at the case with a different set of eyes and possibly come to grips to events and evidence that seem to go against everything that they believe.Overall, a good thriller.  I enjoyed the retro dateline and the crisp writing.  Slaughter again gives you a raw and gritty look into the Atlanta police force and their hunt for a serial copy killer.  The characters feel real and you can't help but get sucked into the story line from page one.  For those that are not ready to start one of her series yet, fans that are looking for her next book or anyone that enjoys a well done cop thriller, this one is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4A2B3HMLUIJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345547497#wasThisHelpful","R4A2B3HMLUIJ8","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My previous cat who wasn't big on play loved it, and her favorite activity was chasing it as I ran a figure 8 on the floor.  My new cat loves it whether you do the figure 8, make her jump or climb into her cat perch to retrieve it or just bat it on her hind legs.  She almost looks ticked off when I roll it up and put it away for the evening.  Relatively inexpensive and pretty durable for what it is, I bought 3, one for now and two more to put away.

Unfortunately, I was having problems finding one for Wyoming and went with the Moon Handbook.  I'm doing ok with this one, and am finding a lot of good information but it is not nearly as comprehensive or well put together.  Another thing that I find a little disappointing is to see the first 24 or so pages in color to then drop off to all black and white pages....what happened?  Did we run out of ink?  Kind of tacky in my opinion.

"This book appealed to me because it has been a tough year and though I am healthy, I run around a lot and sometimes don't take time to slow down as I probably should.  I liked the title and thought this would be a good book to help me do just that.  It is good, however I expected more writing.  The book is broken down in three sections, Morning (Inspiration), Afternoon (Perspiration) and Evening (Exhalation).  Morning was my least favorite, just because it was just one (albeit beautiful) picture and a couple words.  I found myself more interested in the next two sections because they had pictures and more detailed writing about relaxing and how she took care of herself when she found out she had throat cancer and would need to take a leave.  My favorite parts were making yourself a ""kindness"" kit....(I thought this was a great idea, not just for yourself, but for someone you know that could use it).  Also, movies to watch, books to watch etc. in her ""shopping list"" at the back of the book.  I feel like the book could have been a little longer with more writing as I felt her writing was something that I could relate to and liked her style, so though I liked the book, I wish it had had more writing in the morning section.  Overall, a nice book, good for someone that is ill, does too much, is stressed or just is plain burned out.  Make yourself a comfort kit and get a little much needed rest.  The world will be able to get along without you for a little while :) .","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZT2CO9PKGGP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944108#wasThisHelpful","R1ZT2CO9PKGGP6","A1KEK09ZA6J9P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KEK09ZA6J9P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This memoir is a series of essays written over a 30+ year period, many of which have been published before. They flow together nicely with only two twice introduced items.  Like all collections, some essays are better than others.  They range from “Food Mysteries” which I would give a single star to “An Unsolved Mystery: The Lost Friend” which I consider a 5 star telling of teenage best friend anxieties.I almost didn’t read it.  The book begins with “Happy Chicken” which had me wondering where this could possibly go. Because this was Oates, and because it was Niagara County (I’m from there too), I stayed with it.  It turned out to be an artful portrait of childhood memories where the chicken and the child can be one and sometimes separate, all under the eye of indifferent adults.The writing is atmospheric and you can see “place” oozing out of the Niagara County, Madison, WI and the Detroit sections. You learn about Oates’s childhood, her sister, meeting her husband and the outline of the previous generations that produced her.You see the culture of the time that preferred boys and men. Oates reflects on her internalization of this and how she and others accommodated rather than challenged it.If you are not an Oates reader, or if you are not interested in Western NY, this book is not for you. If you are and Oates fan or if you are from Western NY you will be interested in some of these essays.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9HU6IVQX60R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062408674#wasThisHelpful","R3S9HU6IVQX60R","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fictional treatment of the story of Rachel Pomie Pettit Pizzaro, mother of the famed impressionist painter.It has a strong beginning as you get to know Rachel and the St. Thomas social structure.  Rachel is an assertive girl and woman in an age when this was not accepted. You come to understand her dreams and how due to her family’s needs the dreams could not be realized. After one of the tension points is resolved, the book begins an all too slow unwinding.A main focus is the generation gap in a culture where parents by controlling resources and marriage has tremendous control of their children. Issues of religious, racial and gender discrimination are part of the story.This had my attention early on, but once Rachel was developed as a character and Jestine got her news, the narrative, despite some observations on the pecking order in Paris, lost its potency.This was a pleasant read and the author did a lot of research.

"There is a lot to like about this book. It brings the story of Lady Byron to life, but you will find yourself flipping back to see what you missed (only to find that it wasn’t there) and being jarred by sentences with that don’t exactly hang together. The ending has some overly long (i.e. the death of Ada) parts.In the first part of this book you meet a young naive “belle of the ball” who has wealth, doting parents and suitors. She falls in love with the dreamer poet, the rock star of his day. There are glimmers of her his instability which come out full steam just after the marriage vows.  Author Julia Markus takes you through this stormy marriage, the terrible legal situation of Lady Byron (after a year’s marriage to this totally abusive man, her family cedes him access to half their estates on the iffy prospect of keeping their grandchild, to whom this abuser has legal claims) and the how she held her head up through her husband’s vile portraits in his famous works.In the early 1800's there was limited to no understanding of abuse, incest and mental illness. It is painful to imagine a sheltered innocent like Annabelle Milbanke unexpectedly walking into it. You have to marvel at her courage and tact.Rid of Byron Annabelle leads a quiet life as Byron libels her in his poems and his personal life. Following the deaths of her parents she came into great wealth. She founded schools (one attended years later by Peter Townsend, Ronnie Wood and Freddie Mercury), supported working people, and fought against slavery. She raised the daughter of this disastrous marriage and later adopted and raised a child of Byron and his half sister. She told her story to Harriet Beecher Stowe.While the author has done some excellent research, the book needs an editor. The significant issue of Byron’s relationship with his sister and how/when Annabelle knew it is a muddle throughout the first third of the book. There are many smaller episodes, such as daughter Ada being made the Countess of Lovelace, when preceding paragraphs have her mother’s unable to schedule an appointment with Queen Victoria.There are sentences that don’t connect such as on p. 174 “The place was locked down, a fortress, though Colonel Leigh visited her 3 times, her mother once and an aunt, but she didn’t recall which one, sent the religious materials.” Thoughts can dangle, for instance on p. 189 the sentence “Lady Byron was.” leaves you wondering: was what? Preceding sentences suggest she was thinking about Medora’s fatherhood but that should be a given by this time. Another example of many is on p. 192 where it is unclear how Ada’s husband, who had been marginalized long before this, “seemed replaced”… by Ada’s letter from her mother? by Ada’s interest in electricity?There are some characters whom I’d have liked to know more about. Colonel Leigh (and how he came to know and marry Augusta) and John Crosse (and what Ada saw in him).This is an important story and needs a better book. It illustrates not only the sad position of women at the time, it shows how celebrity excuses abusive/amoral behavior. Lord Byron with his “daring” (mental illness/psychopathy) captured the imagination of academics and aesthetes for generations not only by his poetry which was amplified by ""Byronic"" life.  He crafted a public image of someone he was not. As long as his wife, sister, children and others close to him could be silenced, he could have his fortune and fame, fame which continues today.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCKD8A7GSL8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393082687#wasThisHelpful","R3MCKD8A7GSL8O","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gyalo Thondup, The Dali Lama’s brother, tells his story which gives the reader an inside look at the recent history of Tibet.Thondup takes the reader through the Lama selection process and the changed status of his family when his brother was selected. His brothers became monks and Gyalo, who had been destined to support his parents in traditional ways, was selected instead to be educated in China.  As the Chinese increased their control of Tibet, Gyalo, educated, traveled and multi-lingual was able to serve in many ways.There are many sad chapters telling of the suffering of the Tibetans through combat, imprisonment, starvation and the loss of their civil rights in their own countryThe story of CIA involvement is reminiscent of the many attempts to use locals to take on well armed and firmly positioned communists in the 50s told in ""Legacy of Ashes"".  The source material for this is not dry CIA files, but from personal involvement. This is the first time I’ve read or heard the remorse of a survivor, since there have been so few.Through his recounts of meetings with Nehru, Chaing Kai-Shek, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and lesser known officials, you get an inside look at how positions are negotiated, disinformation is spread and how the Dali Lama planned and made his flight to India in 1959.There are sad stories of the continuing suffering of the Tibetans and the complicity of its aristocrats and the government that propped them up.The book begins and ends with Thondup’s retirement from politics in a new career as the owner of a noodle factory. He writes of his sadness at not being able to help his generation of Tibetans. Technology has brought more awareness of the world for today’s better education and he is guardedly optimistic for a better future.Anne Thurston, cited as a co-author, contradicts some material in an Afterward. I have never seen this in a memoir.  I presume there is a story here since some of the contradictions appear to be matters of opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R256LAEJWXVGNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610392892#wasThisHelpful","R256LAEJWXVGNP","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laurence Wright tells of his growing awareness of the world as he experienced the major events of the late 20th century.  His family had moved from Oklahoma to Dallas where this book begins and ends.  He is embarrassingly honest about his early views and awkwardness.Wright remembers the dull Dallas of the 50s, a city of few minorities and strong right wing opinions. LBJ was spat upon and JFK was greeted to Dallas by ads accusing him of treason. It was the home of General Edwin Walker who was influential in the John Birch Society, but more famous for Lee Harvey Oswald’s assassination attempt. Remembering people and events of his youth, Wright sees Texas, with Dallas in particular, as a part of a regional block, which through “new money” rivals the social and political prominence of the “Eastern Establishment”.The Kennedy assassination looms as Wright describes the guilt feelings of the Kennedy-hating establishment of Dallas and the collective shame for having citizens such as Oswald and Jack Ruby.  The conspiracies are touched on and personalized when Wright meets a former employee of Ruby’s in New Orleans (Oswald’s home town), Marilyn “Delilah” Walle, who 8 months later was shot and killed by a man to whom she had been married for one month ((see http://www.amazon.com/Hit-List--Depth-Investigation-Assassination/dp/1620878070/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1446409840&sr=1-1&keywords=hit+list  #24. She could testify about Oswald’s visit(s) to Ruby’s club)).Never using the word “generation gap”, Wright shows how it played out in his family. His parents are part of the “new” America who had sacrificed to win a war against a real and definable evil and afterward saw their lives improve.  They believed in Richard Nixon particularly in contrast to the “Old Establishment” represented by the Kennedy's and through this faith in the nation, supported the Vietnam War, even at the potential cost of their son.He writes of traveling in Europe and reading the French philosophers and finds America wanting.  He visits socialist countries.  In telling his experience of the draft he shows how middle class whites were able to skirt service, leaving the burden to minorities and the poor. Wright seems too easily receives conscientious objector status and went to Egypt for his CO service. There is a lot of reflection on race and the Civil Rights movement. He never mentions the women’s movement.  Expanding roles for women are mentioned as though they just happened. He tells how he changed when at 30 he decides to have children, which he formerly shunned due to his dismal view of politics and the environment.Wright re-recreates the Watergate era when Americans were riveted to the black and white daily drama. Through his parents, Wright shows the effect of the Watergate hearings on Nixon’s “silent majority”.  He writes of southern pride with the subsequent election of Jimmy Carter and gives some detail on Georgia politics of the time.The book ends in 1984  Republican Convention in Dallas, where Ronald Reagan, representative of the “new”, “non-eastern establishment” is confirmed as the new power in the nation.  Here, Wright connects with delegate Eldridge Cleaver, who’s book Soul on Ice once spoke to him years ago and where  General Walker had been busted for lewd behavior and had sold his home to Hari Krishnas.This is not a nostalgic romp of the past.  This is a meaty narrative of how a real person actually grew to adulthood in this unusual time.  In this as in his other early works, Wright shows the talent which will later have recognition in highly acclaimed reporting on 9/11 and Scientology.  Like Wright, I’m a baby boomer and the book is the story of our shared history (inclusive of living a time in Cairo). Being from the northeast and female, I have a different take on the “new” vs. the “old” establishment and place more importance on the women’s movement than Wright and never heard anyone admire Charles Manson, none of which detracts from revisiting this time with Wright.  I’d like to see Wright bring this up to date, with a book on Aging with America, or similar theme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1MXVSCDA9BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345802950#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1MXVSCDA9BH","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because (presumably) the reader had read the first three volumes, the beginning is like catching up old friends.  You read it hungrily.  Then, it bogs down seemingly lost in speculation about the feelings of the characters and their possible motives (normally Ferrante’s forte). You wonder if Ferrante has lost her steam.  100 or so pages later Elena Ferrante shows she is the master as she connects all the material from the long introspective passages and you are off to more powerful events.This set of novels is enormously complex.  While it is a story of friendship, it covers the post-war changes in Italy in general, and, specifically, in a small town that becomes incorporated in Naples.  You see the social differences of rural/southern and urban/northern Italians, the changing attitudes towards family/divorce, the opportunities posed by technology, the rise of the Camorra and the turmoil in government through the eyes of people who lived through and in the maelstrom of change.I was sad to start this volume that ends the Neapolitan series. I steamed through it. I should have slowed down and savored it, but I needed to know the ending.There is some hope for a volume 5 since there are still mysteries.  The neighborhood, which is like a lead character, has changed and many of the people are gone so a Volume 5 would mean a whole different time and place. It would be a challenge, but Ferrante has enormous reach and I believe, could actually do it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OOSK4HATDX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609452860#wasThisHelpful","R25OOSK4HATDX5","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this 3 sittings over 24 hours - fully riveted.Juan Reinaldo Sanchez has seen a lot of the world and even more of life in service to Cuba, or more accurately, Fidel Castro.  Upon his 2008 defection, he must have been a treasure trove for the CIA.Because of his top security position he is able to tell how El Lider Maximo was able to elude over 600 assassination attempts. Castro’s personal security apparatus is a marvel, well supported with personnel and technology. You learn of his special food, how his clothes are laundered, how his double functions, how the staff is trained and scheduled and how Castro is involved in every detail. Besides his security work, Sanchez helped in compiling his boss’ diary/daily log, which if it survives, will fascinate scholars for generations.Dr. Selman, Castro’s physician also deserves respect for his work. He has kept alive his only patient who has had some form of cancer since the 1980’s.  Dr. Selman has at his disposal a private clinic for this sole patient and has on hand two men who share Castro’s rare blood type.There is more here on the Castro family and their living situations than I have ever seen. Castro’s many houses and their appointments stand in contrast to his wardrobe.  The book opens on Castro’s yacht and a description of an island estate. Later there are descriptions of his other homes, each more fitting a capitalist and the head of a poor communist nation.  Sanchez tells of his 9 children by 5 women and where they are and what they are doing today.I have read of  Castro's friendship of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but no where have I seen how close it was. Gabo had his own living quarters in Havana and appears often in this book.  He surely knew of his friend’s double life.Sanchez reminds the reader of Castro’s influence world-wide.  While he has had mixed success with his international interference he is celebrated in communist countries, dictatorships and countries in rebellion. Sanchez has some interesting observations and anecdotes on traveling with Castro.Following his incarceration (and torture) for wanting to retire early (although he doesn’t connect it, it could be his son and daughter’s defections or Castro’s paranoia following the Ochoa affair), Sanchez’s defection took 12 years.  He was closely followed and foiled by his need to be successful and discrete, the weather and other circumstances. His security training served him well in his escape.I expect that a lot here is not just new to me, but truly new. The book is full of information. While it is written in a conversational voice, there are few spare words. Besides the light shown on Castro, you also learn Sanchez's remarkable story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8BWCAZ1RHBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250068762#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8BWCAZ1RHBE","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the few upsides of the Trujillo dictatorship is that it has spawned great literature.  Two Nobel Prize winners have covered it: Gabriel Garcia-Marquez’s  The Autumn of the Patriarch, does not name its subject, but the description surely fits. Mario Vargas Llosa’s  The Feast of the Goat: A Novel is a riveting true to life fictional account of the Trujillo assassination.  Junot Diaz’s Pulitzer Prize winner, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao  shows the long arm of Trujillo’s reach.  Here is another piece of literature, by a notable author with another treatment on life under this dictator. This is a probable story of the Mirabal sisters who dared to defy Trujillo.I was unaware of these women, but from their Wikipedia page (and those of their offspring) you can see their influence and how it continues.The story is told through narratives of the four sisters. Each writes of the everyday concerns of her life and the family.  As Minerva becomes radicalized, you see how her thoughts, determination and actions pull the family in.

Each writes of the everyday concerns of her life and the family. As Minerva becomes radicalized, you see how her thoughts, determination and actions pull the family in.The book is very good, but I’ve withheld a star for a few reasons. The first is that it begins as a page turner. Somewhere around the sisters' imprisonment it becomes wordy. It recovers during the eventual trip through the mountains, but then the wordiness returns. The second is that while the concerns presented by the sisters are individual, with the exception of Maria Teresa’s diary, all the voices (the writing styles) are the same.  Third, but important is that while purists do not like historical fiction that strays from the facts, I admire the imagination, but want more clarification sorting out truth from fiction in a statement from the author.  A chart of the family with the names and nick names would have been helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKD0ZU1PHIE2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565129768#wasThisHelpful","RKD0ZU1PHIE2Q","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an historical survey of the study of American grammar and lexis and the development of its reference materials.Author Rosemary Ostler begins and ends with the work and spirit of Noah Webster who felt strongly that American English should be embraced. English as spoken in the US had evolved to a new language, as was fitting for a new country.  British grammar texts or dictionaries were no longer relevant. Webster created an American English grammar text which he promoted by lecturing all around the country.  The dictionary that bears his name came after an editing career.Controversies raged as to whether grammarians should promote a “correct” form or merely describe the language as it is used. Ostler shows the demise of teaching Latin for learning grammar, and then demise of teaching grammar for learning English.  Today, grammar takes a back seat to style (“precision”, “brevity” and “clarity”, p. 236) but the debate on “correct form” continues on the internet.You learn the genesis of the bans on double negatives and split infinitives, the elimination of the “k” in “music”, “public” and similar words, the introduction of sentence diagramming and more.  Ostler shows the very heated debates over the changing language: “It is I” vs. “It is me.”  For purists “jeopardize” and “finalize” were not really words and a should be a “scientist” be a “sciencist”?Author Rosemary Ostler also defines the historical and literary sources for new words.  The Jacksonian Era, the era of the common man (think Davy Crockett), brought new words from frontier and a greater acceptance of grammatical informality.  The Grant years brought words of excess and Theodore Roosevelt, slang. Dime novels added sensational words, and Mark Twain supplied regional vocabulary. As new words were added, many were condemned as “base”, “deplorable” and “unspeakable”.A host of personalities are given a personal treatment along with their contributions.  Besides a long narrative on Noah Webster, you learn about seldom spoken of people. For instance more than 10 pages are devoted to a bio of Lindley Murray, the author of a foundational grammar text and another 10 for Fitzedward Hall, a Sanskrit scholar and major contributor to the “Oxford English Dictionary”.  Stripped of the many bios, the book would be reduced by, perhaps, 30-40%.This is a user friendly niche history. If you are interested in the topic, it is a must read; If you are not, it will not pull you in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162AB0NWGYMME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250046122#wasThisHelpful","R162AB0NWGYMME","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the title doesn’t promise much in this regard, I chose this book to learn more about Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.  There isn’t a lot on them (they make their appearances after 1/3 of the book), but author Paul Collins gives you a very readable a glimpse of New York 1799-1800 along with a murder mystery.The book opens with a body found in a well owned by the Manhattan Company, a water utility founded by Aaron Burr.  The victim was a resident of a Greenwich Street boarding house, where the defendant also lived.  The defendant’s brother was an important construction contractor with ties to both Burr and Hamilton and hence (perhaps) the country’s first legal dream team of Burr and Hamiliton joined by celebrity lawyer, Henry Brockholst Livingston, was formed for the defense.Most interesting are the slices of New York City Life.  You learn the 1800 landscape of what is now a fully built island.  You learn how boarding houses were run and furnished, about sanitation problems, how summer diseases affected the city, the practice of journalism, the state of prisons and who was in them, how people grieved the death of George Washington and more.Best of all, the narrative shows the criminal justice system at the time. While the “adversarial” system (making arguments for guilty and not guilty) was in its infancy, legal tactics as shown by the defense are advanced. They object to witnesses in the courtroom, they object to points of law taken out of context, and through questioning they get witnesses to discredit themselves. At one point a juror asked a question, which is different from today. As the trial unexpectedly went beyond midnight (the defense made a clever use of candles) there were makeshift plans for sequestering the jurors. Collins shows the improvements in formal court reporting and in the popular press reportage of trials that had their genesis in this trial.New York City was small at this time (Greenwich Village was considered north) and trial participants had interlocking relationships.  Collins shows that a mob would do damage to lawyers and prosecutors if they didn’t like the results.This is a nicely crafted micro-history which will be of interest to general readers of the period, particularly those interested in the evolution of the criminal justice system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y7EUNZOZ5KLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956466#wasThisHelpful","R2Y7EUNZOZ5KLH","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a modern telling of the story of Achilles and the Trojan War is said to be true to the original “Illiad” by Homer. It is very readable and builds to a climactic ending.There are many highlights.  The first is the description of how suitors for Helen of Sparta (later Troy) vied for her hand and the last is the burial of Achilles.  Ancient battle, as experienced by Patroclus, is a marvel of creative writing.  Well conceived and compellingly written episodes include Achilles and Patroclus living with and learning from (the centaur) Chiron; Patroclus’s search and rescue of Achilles on the island of Scyros; the deception of Iphigenia; and everyday life during the 10 year encampment outside of Troy.The book is said to be faithful to Homer’s work, but wonder if the detail that brings it life is part of the original.  For instance on p. 260 we learn that Nestor used heated honeyed syrup for his throat, Menelaus used opium for headaches and Ajax had an acid stomach.On the weak side, at times the portrayal of affection between Achilles and Patroclus was melodramatic and Achilles was not always in character.  This is small compared to the full narrative.  Madeline Miller has put new life into what may be the oldest surviving piece of western literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5GZFE1QBLPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060627#wasThisHelpful","R3S5GZFE1QBLPZ","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Writing for the general audience requires decisions that academic writers never need to make. The scholar can report the facts but reported facts would quickly lose a general readership. Academic writers can present issues and controversies and build a logical interpretive case. The general audience needs a condensed background and a wants a good story with the settled facts.  Academics don’t often deal in personality, and the general reader wants to know and relate to the characters.This is the third Nancy Goldstone book I’ve read. In this one, for me, she has hit the perfect style.  I had very little background, and Goldstone gave just enough to get me into the story. As I came to understand the people and their situation it was more and more riveting.  Last night I couldn’t sleep until I knew how Marguerite got out of her captivity.The two women come alive. Goldstone not only describes, she interprets:  Catherine’s abandonment of  the Huguenots (she only needed them when she had no access to power), her hatred of the Guise family (too powerful and too popular), her  travels  (to “sell”  herself or to dazzle Henry’s court with the beauties of Paris); the reasons for Marguerite’s patience with her husband (appearances for her mother and brother; her safety, her lack of attraction to him,  etc.) her flights (to counterbalance her brother or fear for her life) and more.The men come to life as well as Goldstone interprets the reasons for Henry of Navarre’s conversions (youth, loyalty, kingship); Henri III’s view of Poland (no parties!), his favorites (and how they dressed); and poor young Charles IX (overwhelmed by his mother) and more.  Most compelling was the understated reaction of Henry (of Navarre) when Catherine (de Medici) offers him with a deal in which she and her son (Henri III) will kill his wife (her daughter, Henri’s sister).The epilogue gave me what I need to situate this as prologue to subsequent French history of which I am more familiar.The Index worked for the few times I checked it. I read all the on page footnotes (a sign that they are useful). All the color photos are great; I wish there were more.I highly recommend this book for the general reader. It is a story of adventure, a dual character study, a story of the mind set of the times and a thoroughly engrossing read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IS48PRUCOFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316409650#wasThisHelpful","R30IS48PRUCOFN","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once I understood that this was not a book about Pope Francis or about the future of the Catholic Church, it was a better read. I still cannot help but feel deceived by the title.The book is a series of essays showing how the Catholic Church has been changing, or more precisely, evolving over its long history.  Five major issues are used for illustration: the change from Latin to local languages; the relationship of Church and state and as envisioned and promoted by Vatican leaders; how anti-Semitism emerged and waned;  the reliance on natural law (women and issues of sex) and forgiveness. There is an Epilogue which is a short essay on Pope Francis and how he admitted an error how it changed his life and approach to the priesthood.For me, the most informative section was on how Anti-Semitism evolved in the Catholic Church over 2000 years. Earlier this year I had read the Pope and Mussolini which gave a detailed description of this short relationship, which Wills shows to be the result of a long chain of church policy.The footnotes were good. Their placement at the end of each chapter was helpful.I think this book was put together to capitalize on the Pope’s visit to the US.  This does not diminish the quality of the material, but the quantity of the material (lots of white space and indented lay outs) also suggests a rush to feed ""popemania"".

"Alanna Nash has done her homework. Each paragraph is packed with info on this extraordinary man and his “work”. While there are some parts that could be improved, taken as a whole, this is a landmark presentation of “the Colonel” and his most important relationship.The beginning is riveting. You learn of the lonely, abused, animal loving Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk who abruptly left Holland to begin a life in America.  Nash describes his hand to mouth carnival career and how his huckster tricks informed his approach to the promotion of Elvis. He began using the name Col. Tom Parker during his stint in the US Army where had an unusual honorable discharge. His pre-Elvis life included work for the Tampa Animal Shelter and the start of his unusual “marriage”.The parts on how Parker changed from the carnival life to promoting country acts, how he obtained Elvis’ contract  (i.e. how did rumoring that the Elvis contract was for sale  make it so?) and the early years of managing Elvis are weak sections.  Some paragraphs seem to stand on their own with no connection to each other. Some areas need more attention, such as Parker’s relationship with Gladys Presley, the entrance of Pricilla into Elvis’ life and the relationship with the Carter family which seems to be important (Mother Maybelle plays poker with Mrs. Parker and the quote from June on p. 337-8 implies a close friendship.)Nash does a good job of showing how Parker’s self dealing hindered not only Elvis’ earnings but also his artistic development. Parker required that Elvis sing the songs he had the rights to and that Elvis movies had to support marketing of the songs. Working with Barbra Streisand or other artists who offered partnerships was out of the question, as was international travel.  Parker saw that Vernon Presley was sufficiently conned and schemed to keep Elvis dependent and docile.The ending is strong as she shows the impact of this unorthodox relationship on Elvis.  The Presley heirs were sufficiently confident in Parker’s management that it to a Probate Court staffer to uncover the issues for which the fast-talking Parker had ready defenses.Throughout the book you see the how the “establishment” managers saw Elvis as a fad. Parker is right in that he made Elvis his priority as no one else had.  The reader is left to determine whether or not there would be an Elvis if there were no Colonel.There are some good black and white photos, the most interesting ones being of the Parker's early life.

"The painting was new and different when first shown at the Paris Salon of 1883 under the name “Portraits of Children”.  It defied the norm for childhood paintings in that the girls were not formally dressed or sweetly posed as was the period’s norm for childhood portraits.Critics were mixed.  Most responded based on their acceptance (or rejection) of impressionism as a new style of painting and/or of Americans who seemed too visible in the established Parisian world of art. Today, Sargent is considered the leading portrait painter of his generation and this painting to be one of his masterpieces.Author, Erica Hirshler, had little to work with since not much is known about the conception of the painting or the lives of the girls pictured.She begins with the character of the Bois family, their wealth, their itinerant lifestyle and the birth and loss of their children.  She describes Sargent and art world that he and Edward Bois faced on two continents. There is discussion of the setting which is clearly their home and the Japanese vases that have crossed the Atlantic several times with the family. You learn about the painting and its reception. The end, which tells of the later lives of the girls and modern interpretations of the painting, was the highlight for me.Sargent, known for bringing out the essence of his subjects, was on to something. That “something”, whatever it is, is the allure of the painting.  The girls stand apart and alone. There is the suggestion that they have been interrupted while playing, but only one has a toy.  The atmosphere is stark, but its opulence is suggested by the size of this hallway or foyer, the seemingly valuable vases and the immaculate “play” clothing of the girls, two of which are getting too old for pinafores. The painting’s title does not acknowledge their mother (deceased at the time of its final naming). It is hard to define the expressions of these girls, but the three who acknowledge the viewer seem to be either uncertain about him/her. Hirshler shows various schools of thought on these girls, their expressions and their later lives.Quotes embedded in the text and in their own indented paragraphs account for, perhaps,  of the book. There are quotes are from Edward Boit, himelf; Boit’s Edward brother; Sargent’s friend Henry James; a host of critics and writers of the day such as Edith Wharton.  They describe the luxurious life of Americans abroad, the Boit family and the opinions of the art world.There are lots of visuals. Black and white photos of art work, people appear with the related text. There are two sections of color plates. One section of color plates is devoted to this painting with several plates showing detail. This book would have worked well in a larger size (coffee table) volume.The index worked for everything I checked. The Notes confirm the reliance on primary sources.It is hard to tell if the narrative is dry due to the lives of the subjects or the author's distance from her subjects. There was admittedly little to work with, and what she found was patchy, but Erica Hirshler has provided insight into this landmark painting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKBSGWU1D1BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878467424#wasThisHelpful","R1BKBSGWU1D1BV","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fictional treatment of Virginie Amelie Avegno Gautreau, the “Madame X” of John Singer Sargent’s famous portrait.  It was published in 2003, just one year too soon to benefit from http://www.amazon.com/Strapless-Deborah-Davis/dp/158542336X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1442602920&sr=1-1&keywords=strapless,  the first book length biography of Madame Gautreau.Gioia Diliberto created a thrilling escape scene (the Union Army threatens the New Orleans plantation home of Gautreau as a child) worthy of Hollywood movie. In reality, it was probably quite dull.  In Paris they did not settle into flea-bag apartment; they went to a property they owned, but Diliberto’s imagination is much more fun.Where Diliberto may be spot on is in grafting a personality on to the portrait.  Written in the first person, Gautreau shows herself to be adventuresome and daring particularly when it comes to being the center of attention. She is obsessed with her looks and who notices them.  Her social climbing mother tries to get invites to parties with royalty (and former royalty – this is belle epoch Paris) and marry her daughter “up”.  Diliberto shows how these were perfect conditions for someone to agree to this project, which was daring for its day (think: Janet Jackson, wardrobe malfunction).The author’s ideas in creating Gautreau’s life are excellent, but the text seems too detached to be the voice of her subject.  For instance, descriptions of Gautreau’s mother’s reception and the brief text of the Salon unveiling are well done as are how Gautreau’s marriage was sprung on her and how the “folk” expressed pride in their mistress’s picture.  These events are excellent imaginings for conveying what may have happened but the narrator does not sound like the person who lived it.  Similarly the situations depicting her conflicts with the mother, how her teenage heart was broken, the realities of a “marriage blanc” an affair with a politician, the boredom of sitting for a portrait and the issues that arise when someone takes control of your image is are excellent creations. They are told like a reporter and not like a survivor.Purists will not like this book because it strays from the facts. I appreciated the creativity of the author and believe authors of historical fiction should have this sort of poetic license as long as they separate fact from fiction in the preface or the notes as Diliberto has done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1304ZF3UBGUXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743456807#wasThisHelpful","R1304ZF3UBGUXW","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anna Erelle (pseudonym) developed an online identity to gather info for free lance articles on ISIS.  After several years of presence, her online avatar Melodie catches the eye of, perhaps, an ISIS recruiter.  This man, Bilel, is more than a recruiter, he turns out to be a French speaking confidant of ISIS leader, Abu Baker al-Baghdadi.She Facebooks and Skypes with him and arranges for a photographer document the conversations. Events move quickly and within weeks Bilel proposes and says he has accomplished their marriage. He has arranged for her to join him in Syria.The text has three main flaws. One is the wordiness. This is most distracting when author’s comments on her “husband’s” quotes.  This is unnecessary since his words speak for themselves.  The other is imprecision which may be the fault of the translation.  I couldn’t tell if Andre was taping or merely shooting stills of the conversations.  On p. 165 was Charly’s comment about being recognized a joke, when p. 161 implied that they had met? These are small, but they add up.  The third flaw is the lack of analysis. This would not be important if this was a mere reporting of what happened, but it is not.She writes on what it is like to live with, first, her double identity and, then, with a fatwa on her life.Having had this experience and with her background in working with families of ISIS recruits, I expected more from Erelle.  While the sweet talk mixed with bullying was clearly odious, why are others falling for it?  Words wasted on interpreting Bilel’s comments could have been used for more real journalism on Vanessa, the Hamza family, Bilel’s 3 wives, Fatima, etc., and how they fit into the currents of the ISIS brand of jihad.While this as a book is a 2.5 or a 3; the author’s work is important and she has created a gripping read, so the book is getting a 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MLGECH5VDNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006241707X#wasThisHelpful","R21MLGECH5VDNP","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In high school I learned that neither matter nor energy could be created nor destroyed. Any girl scout sitting around a campfire would know this not to be true, but it took 30 years later for text books to get on board.  Guy Deutscher challenges the parallel linguistics axiom: “The fundamentals of language are coded in our genes and are the same across the human race…  All languages share the same universal grammar, the same underlying concepts, same degree of systemic complexity” (p. 6).Deutscher questions who explored all the languages, their methods and how they arrived at these conclusions, and refutes one major ramification of the assumption: that language does not influence thinking.  Those who get to know speakers of other languages are sure to have heard the phrase, “it doesn’t translate very well.”The first part of the book is devoted to how language reflects the culture, and the later part on how the language can influence the thought process.Deutscher is a great story teller. An interesting sketch of William Gladstone who (prior to being PM of Great Britain) noted Homer’s very limited color vocabulary, introduces the debate on the consciousness of color.  He describes several landmark studies that suggest evolving vision and color vocabulary. Color is revisited in the discussion of language shaping our thoughts. Speakers of languages with a rich vocabulary for color demonstrate an acuity not present in those whose languages are not as precise in color.The perception of space varies in language, with (often) rural cultures speaking of the object on their “east”. Directional phrases for languages in developed countries are left, right, and specific prepositions for behind, in front of, etc.  Lest this leads you to think that a more developed culture will have a more specific language, Deutscher introduces Matses (Peru/Brazil), where verbs have a specific time and certainty, besides properties of tense and number.The concept of “gender” in language is used to demonstrate how thinking is influenced by words. A number of word experiments are described showing that gender, while in all practicality is divorced from sex identification, influences concepts and memory.This is a good read. Complex ideas are clearly presented, while Deutscher can be wordy at times, he can be very entertaining.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK2N9H7UQMRI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312610491#wasThisHelpful","RK2N9H7UQMRI0","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn’t finish this book. The two stars represent the experience up to p. 210, which showed no sign of improving.  Normally, I drop books like this before p. 100 and put them aside without review.  I’m writing this because I wanted to know about Keynes and this book was such a let down.It is organized around his different roles: “The Official”, “The Public Man”, “the Lover” (where I gave up), “The Connoisseur” and “The Envoy”. This means that you run into things like Keynes’ traveling with his wife to her native Russia, after you learn that he is gay, and before any other mention of her, and at p. 210 – still no mention of courtship/marriage. The text can be bumpy; a reference like “this book” can be used but its antecedent is two or three pages prior.There is a reliance on subjective and personal opinions. You learn what people think of him and what he thought of others. While you might expect them in ""Lover"" sections, they are all over the career sections.  An example of this chatty/catty trait on p. 56 is the description of the Apostles (a Cambridge philosophical group) who are described as “charmless”, “gawky” “unlovely”; One member had acne and walked comically. On p. 176, the “New Statesman  said of Keynes: “He seems to have almost every defect … almost certifiable, extraordinarily tendentious in a frightfully boring way, with bees in bonnets…”  This type of quoted material can be strung together over several pages.Either the book or Keynes is Euro-central to a fault. The Treaty of Versailles is only discussed regarding Europe, with no mention of the carving up of the Middle East. Virginia Woolf (his good friend who thought “he looked like an eel” (p.191)) through long quotes critiques economic and political theory.If I had more background in British history of the WWI, the post war period and its players this may have helped, but it would not have changed the text which is full of petty tidbits (i.e. Keynes flirted with Einstein). People and events for which I had no context were listed and/or named in passing. I just gave up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIRMKDHUI3F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465060676#wasThisHelpful","R2LIRMKDHUI3F5","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be the closest we can come to seeing African-American culture of Florida two generations away from slavery.  Some may say that the book comes from a woman’s point of view, but the story rings so true that it can hardly be called a slant or opinion.Zora Neal Hurston’s knowledge of American folklore shines in this novel.Janie, the protagonist, is a woman of endurance and high spirits. She does not let a bad marriage get her down and twice takes a chance on adventure.  Husbands re-locate her to different Florida communities, each of which operates outside of the white world, interfacing only for employment, the legal system and in times of crisis, in this book, a hurricane. The whites are also present in the mixed race off- spring, like Janie, whose mothers are left to fend for themselves.Through Janie you see how women, even those in comfortable situations, had to cope with the men who, through marriage, ran their lives.  The culture permitted violence against women, sometimes merely for the man to make a point to others.The story is mostly told through the dialog, of the characters. The characters’ speech, flowing in a thick dialect, is a pithy, idiomatic and direct; While it reflects little education it is imaginative and at times, poetic.. An educated narrator interprets, providing commentary and linkageThis book is on so many reading lists I imagine my literary friends have presumed I’ve already read it (once or twice). I started it a few times but found the dialect exhausting and put it aside. It recently came as a birthday gift from my sister, so it got my attention and I’m glad I stayed with it.Hurston, who was unappreciated in her time, through this book alone, has made a great contribution to American literature. The dialect, which I previously felt exhausting, was the star of the book.  It allowed the characters to reveal themselves through their authentic voices. This peek into a world that no longer exists is a rare literary treasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSN9QVFB084PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061120065#wasThisHelpful","RSN9QVFB084PM","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1913 Leda married her cousin Dante by proxy (his father stood in for him) and left her small town in Italy to be with him in Argentina. Upon arrival she finds he had been shot in an anarchist demonstration.  This is the story of her luck and pluck as she seeks to make a life for herself. Music, tango music, is her passion and chosen profession.Besides the story of Leda and descriptions of life in southern Italian towns and in the conventillos of Buenos Aires, the reader is introduced to the birth and growth of tango.  It starts small among the poor with available instruments. It seeps into brothels and to fancy clubs. It adds new instruments, vocals and female dancers.The book provokes thoughts on gender roles and the difficulties of women in meeting society’s expectations. There are great scenes when Leda looks men in the eye and spits on the sidewalk with an appreciation of these gestures. I had not expected the plot.In the early part of the book it seemed that the writer was stretching the story.  As the story comes to a climax it’s a page turner.Credit needs to go to the Knopf book designer. Not only is the cover beautiful, you see the care with which the paper, the print and binding were selected.I would give this book 4.5 stars because of the early labored writing, but I’ll give that a pass and give 5 stars for the difficulty of and daring in telling this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDMB9JB5X8IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110187449X#wasThisHelpful","REDMB9JB5X8IA","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ashlee Vance covers the multiple aspects of Elon Musk’s life and work. Since Musk’s work consumes the better part of his life, most of the text is on his business projects, each of which is a breakthrough for its time.His South African childhood was marked by bullies at school, hints of abuse at home violence over apartheid in his area. His mother has an interesting background; there not much about his father.  Although his grim childhood is referred to as influential in his character, the section is too short for the reader to draw conclusions.Musk’s goal was to go to America.  He took a chance on finding an “anchor family” (his mother’s relations whom did not know) in Canada and from there was able to get to the University of Pennsylvania.  There is no info on how he (and his brother) managed the visa system or on their current citizenship status, but Musk appears to be in the US to stay.Vance shines in presenting the engineering and business aspects of Musk’s life and evaluating Musk’s products. He walks the reader through their development, financing and the decisions and management style that brought them about.  He writes clearly so that non space-geeks can understand the problems of a rocket’s seals, fuel and its weight, specialty parts and launch sites and non-car buffs can appreciate designs that do not need a dash board to muffle engine noise, that enable ease of entry and are wired such repair via the internet is possible. It is an extraordinary person who can write the code for PayPal, understand the physics of a space launch and raise the price of pre-ordered cars.  The experience in losing control of PayPal highly influences his decisions for keeping a tight rein of SpaceX and Tesla. His personnel management can be and has been brutal. I’d be interested in the forced turnover data. There has to be a trail of paperwork, perhaps litigation.We can pretty much agree that swallowed up by an industry giant there would not be a rocket that can return from a trip built at  the cost of its peers or an electric car with the range, style and safety features of a Tesla.  These industry giants would certainly would never tolerate talk of a colonizing Mars.Vance gives you an appreciation for Musk as an inventor and entrepreneur. You come to learn about his hard work and the challenges he faced, but you don’t understand much about Musk.This is just about all of what is presented in Musk’s personal life: His brother is with him through Zip2 and then he appears now and then and they vacation together. Musk seems to be in business with his cousins. His mother is a model, at 60+ years with covers on fashion magazines. (Is she living in the US? Is she part of his life?)  After he suddenly ended his marriage he married almost the first “woman” (22 years old?) he met. He divorced her and married her again and is now divorced.  (From her quotes in this book and her cameo in “Revenge of the Electric Car”, she doesn’t seem like a committed partner.)  At age 7 he banned stuffed toys for his sons, with whom the hours he claims to spend don’t add up.The book is a good presentation of Musk and his empire. Filling in the areas it lacks (childhood, family, personnel management) would make it a much longer book, and may be outside the author’s expertise. There are some photos. An index would have been helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJ13L16VRUPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062301233#wasThisHelpful","R2DJ13L16VRUPG","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in 2002, author M.T. Anderson saw the internet as we know it today with the added dimension that it could be directly “fed” into a brain.It is hard to tell when this takes place. Internet development is contemporary with banner ads, chat functions and a version of “liking”. It is far enough into the future for travel to the moon and planets (and other items whose mention could be spoilers). There are references to what will probably be anachronisms by the time holograms can be school teachers, such as malls and fireplaces, and maybe Coca Cola, Nike, and countries too.The themes of advertising and consumerism predominate but there are some unexplored concepts, for instance the trade marking of “clouds” and “school”. There is a “conceptionarium” which seems to be an advanced way of producing/designing children. The popularity of “lesions” is not explained, but seems rather extreme to be a metaphor for tattoos.Social issues are touched on, such as who can afford access to the feed; how lives are more difficult without the feed; insurance doesn’t cover (feed) software malfunction even though it can ruin mobility and overall health, like 2002  (pre-Obamacare) preconditions.There are words that may be the slang of the future (or maybe these words have come and/or gone from US high schools).Stripped of all the once and future talk, this is a quasi-love story. The most provocative discussion question at the end of the 2004 paperback edition is: “In a consumer society, once things have outlived their usefulness, they tend to be discarded. How might this affect the way people interact with one another?”","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L53FABKBG23J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763662623#wasThisHelpful","R2L53FABKBG23J","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was only weeks ago that I learned that the Kardashians were related to Kanye West and Bruce Jenner. My life doesn’t intersect with theirs.  They are creatures of web sites, cable channels and glossy magazines that are not in my world.  Realizing their status in popular culture, I felt the need to bone up.  For my limited purposes, this was as good a book as any.While this is the romantic story of Kim and Kanye, the focus on Kim gives the reader a glimpse of the life of a reality TV celebrity.  While at the top of her game, Kim remains in the “B” celebrity niche:  Paris Hilton dropped her; she is a bad fit for a wedding at Versailles; she had to endure snubs from Anna Wintour for years before she made the cover of Vogue (and sales plummeted, but Amazon shows the issue to be a fledgling collector's item);  her second husband sued her for using their marriage to boost her ratings; she has a Playboy spread and a similarly, not “A list” motorcycle video with Kanye; despite Kanye’s best friend relationship with Beyonce’s husband, Beyonce will not warm up to Kim.There is an inordinate amount of time and money devoted to her looks.  There is a staff, exercise equipment (in each house and travel location) and devotion to dieting. Her “fans” are very harsh about any weight gain.  Image maintenance extends to her daughter who at one year old has carefully selected ensembles laid out each day (no variation allowed when in the care of others) and an exercise program.Kim (or maybe her staff) is constantly tweeting, blogging and posting Instagram photos. The story line is that Kanye shuns the limelight, but his engagement surprise certainly belied that stance.  Wedding guests had to surrender cell phones (and were given limited phones for the duration) and carefully controlled pictures emerged from the wedding Kanye did not want promoted.  Kardashian brother, Robert, did not attend the wedding, it is said because he had gained 40 pounds… (not so good in a photo).The book is a trip into the world of ostentatious living…a giant diamond wedding ring and a run through of 4 jewelers to set it, a gold bathroom boxed up for a wedding gift,  a “bottom” room with 5 machines devoted to Kim’s butt, fireworks,  a rented stadium for special (private) occasions and more.Despite their materialism and narcissism they both seem like very positive people. They brim with energy.  They are generous (giving tips in the 4 digits) and seem to be much in love.The content is thin. A lot is repeated as though not previously mentioned: for instance for 3 seasons of the reality show the Kardashian’s will be paid 4 million; Kim sees parallels of her life to Kate Middleton’s; President Obama has called Kanye a “jackass” twice.The book is OK.  I didn’t expect much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGDI0809IWL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784180297#wasThisHelpful","RWGDI0809IWL0","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He had lost all of England’s land in what we now call France. As he died England was in a civil war and fending off a foreign invasion. From the distance of 8 centuries it may be impossible to determine what went wrong.  On the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, King John’s accidental achievement, Stephen Church gives us some tools to try.Church shows the power of a medieval king.  John held between 20-33% of the Kingdom’s money and through taxation and confiscation could take more.  As is demonstrated in the end, he had the power to disinherit anyone, to take their lands and give them to someone else.  He had the power to create what sound like forest preserves, which would render land useless, not only for its owner but all who worked it on his behalf. It was an act of remarkable bravery or foolishness to defy the king.He lost British lands on the continent, some believed by not being showing up. He began a feud with the Pope over an Archbishop appointment and got himself and most of his kingdom excommunicated. He taxed in every way possible way: the 13th tax; tax on movable goods, taxes on the clergy; special taxes on the Jews, and creating forest lands. He took on his own appointees in Ireland and Wales. He brutally killed his nephew and caused terrible suffering for those who's loyalty he questioned.He was so not trusted by his constituents that they risked all to force the Magna Carta, a document that John set out to destroy, into being.Since this is about the famous document and the political events leading up to it Church does not explore John and how he came to destroy himself as he did. He does describe the power of the office; Can it be concluded that John saw no limits to his power? There is some reference to his family, but no discussion of how dysfunctional it was how it might have fostered John's distrust as world view.The book has an abbreviated (but clear) genealogical chart, four abbreviated (somewhat clear) maps and extensive footnotes. There are no plates and the sole illustration is that of an effigy carved shortly after his death.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17USI90CDPEQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465092993#wasThisHelpful","R17USI90CDPEQ2","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stayed with it since it’s a Pulitzer Prize winner and thousands of readers have given it 5 stars. My criticisms may be a matter of taste, but I thought the characters were too vague, the times line unnecessarily confusing and the magic jewel did not work for me as a part of the plot.Of the major characters, we don’t know what makes them tick. Of Marie-Laurie we know that she is blind, loves and is loved by her father and his small family and collects shells. We don’t know her sense of right and wrong, her feelings about the war, her hopes for the future, etc. We understand Werner a bit more. He is sentimental and nostalgic, a talented radio engineer and a reluctant participant in the brutality of his “training”. The most clearly drawn character was Frederick. I’m glad he was there, but he was not central to the plot.I prefer a linear book, but could accept time switching if it had a role. There seems to be no purpose and the result is that it only confuses. One character is all but introduced by his death, with the reader to later learn that he is a minor character.Does the plot really need a magic jewel? As events unfold, with some adjustment, any keepsake would work.On the plus side, the depiction of the Nazi training camp was excellent. On the negative side, the portrayal of the French resistance was vague.The book reads quickly. It has a higher visual content than most novels so I’m expecting a movie sometime in the next two years or so.  I think the director will have re-write and the film will be mostly chronological, characters will be drawn such that we care about them, the jewel will stay magical and the ending more conclusive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OCLX5V4LFL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476746583#wasThisHelpful","R39OCLX5V4LFL9","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unusual book was a Man Booker finalist for 2014 and received various other awards and nominations.I can tell you without spoilers that the narrator, Rosemary Cooke, lost her sister at age 5.  Her brother disappeared when he was in high school, stranding its basketball team as it faced an important game.  This second loss was a direct result of the first.Most of the narrator’s reflection takes place as the writer is in college.  She integrates what she is learning in science, philosophy and psychology to the family drama and secrets.The author, Karen Joy Fowler’s descriptions sound exactly the way a 20 something college student would write. There is nothing forced or contrived:  “I missed a lot … because of the way the blood was rampaging through my brain.” and dialog, exactly the way a 20 something college student would talk: “It was totally wack crashing your place without asking. I get it”.Like all college students Rosemary remembers her childhood, not just her sister Fern, but the literature, Mary Poppins, Charlotte’s Web, Winnie the Pooh and more. I spot checked the (adult) books and research cited, and yes, they are real, just like the kiddie lit.This book held my attention throughout.

"This is an entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing. At the end, once you are on to the killer you are still guessing about how the author will wrap it up.The story is told in a series of vignettes each focusing on a character somehow associated with the deceased.  The format is perfect for a newspaper serial or a TV mini-series.The character development is such that you understand and care about the people in this town in Sweden. Most of those who know the victim have a motive and a cover story.  There are sub plots and action that will lead you both to the solution and away from it.The outcome fits the clues.The weakness is that not all the loose ends are tied up.

"In this epic work, Norman Mailer shows the complexity that is Lee Harvey Oswald and leaves the reader to determine: Did he have the soul of a Killer?Mailer begins with Oswald’s trip to Russia and works backward through Oswald’s early family life, then forward with through his return to the US with his Russian wife.  I took this book on a long flight (next trip I’m digital), so If I hadn’t been a captive audience, I wouldn’t have finished it. The early part is almost straight reporting, covering in more detail the Russian portions that originally appeared in  Marina and Lee: The Tormented Love and Fatal Obsession Behind Lee Harvey Oswald's Assassination of John F. Kennedy. After this, the book gets more interesting and it held my attention through the long flight.The text is comprised of excerpts from the reports of the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassination, transcripts from the FBI and Russian intelligence services (some are conversations from Oswald’s bugged apartment), interviews by Mailer and Larry Schiller, the work of Priscilla McMillan, Norman Posner, and Edward Epstein and a few other sources.  Each is introduced with a pithy narrative using the “royal we” that sets the stage or interprets what is to come.While Mailer does not give an opinion on whether Oswald did the deed, he does have an opinion on its aftermath: for the intelligence establishment, a trial would be explosive since Mafia-CIA-FBI links would be revealed. Mailer notes, throughout, that while the 26 volume Warren Commission Report (which relied on FBI and CIA staff) leaves too many loose ends, it does provide a wealth of information on people and life in the US at this time.  There is important by spotty documentation of dates and activities but, Mailer notes that it was typical of the Commission that more time was spent investigating everyone on the public bus Oswald took to Mexico than Oswald’s pro and anti Castro associates in New Orleans.There is material I had not seen elsewhere.  For instance there are interviews of Oswald’s acquaintances in Minsk that Mailer and his associates had in the 1990’s, showing how just knowing Oswald affected their lives and careers. There is insight into the dilemma Oswald’s presence in Russia and his later “fame"" posed for the KGB.  There was new, to me, information on Oswald’s stint in the Marines  which shows possible early on intelligence involvement in Japan. While Mailer says too much is made of his dubious sexuality, Mailer shows possible roots of it in the Marines.The intent of the book is to assess the character of Oswald but you also get interpretive portraits of his mother Marguerite, his “friend” George de Mohrenschildt, Marina’s uncle and aunt in Minsk and her friend Ruth Paine and of Jack Ruby.  The description of talk show host William Kirk Stuckey’s treatment of Oswald is one of the many short personality profiles that deliver wider perspective. Mailer's take on Ruby's tortured mission is pure Mailer... and probably true.The book badly needs an index. On p. 703 Allan Dulles seems to be questioning Oswald while in custody in Dallas.  I flipped back but could find no context. Maybe this was an editorial glitch and the questions were from the Warren Commission, to which he was appointed one year hence. (Dulles later appears at a small dinner party given by Jackie Kennedy’s mother and stepfather along with George de Mohrenschildt.  (What it means for a daughter when her mother invites a known friend of the person most believed to have killed her daughter’s husband to dinner, is not explored)).  Dulles’s interest in keeping a lid on things would be apparent to anyone who read  The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War.I am not sure where it fits in the mountains of material on this topic. It hardly makes a notice in material on Mailer and his body of work.  It is the Mailer voice with his Mailer take, and while 20 years old, the prose is not dated. This book unites many primary sources with insightful commentary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CNRFTLK02WIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345404378#wasThisHelpful","R2CNRFTLK02WIR","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first part of this book shows the influence that Saudi Arabian oil wealth has bought in the US. In the second the author through his experiences in the CIA shows how the US is ill equipped to fight the terrorism due to the Saudi influence.The number and size of gifts, contracts, commissions and jobs bestowed on US politicians and policy makers by the Saudi Royal family is staggering.  In its own country, the royal family similarly uses its wealth to stay in power. Gifts to the charities of the fanatical Wahhabi leaders, who through their religious control of the people can start or stop a revolution, support the madrassas that produce political/religious radicalism. Such a revolution has plenty of fuel.  The “beneficiaries” of free housing and cheap power are virtual slaves to a system where a growing number of arrogant princes can take whatever they want.  (i.e. You’ve built a thriving restaurant or live in a good development location and a prince wants what you have – it is his.)As a CIA operative in the 1980’s and 1990’s, Baer saw the growing anti-US sentiment in the Middle East and the CIA as an organization geared only to fighting communism/Russia.  He cites instance after instance where his leads, requests and advice about Muslim charities and ubiquitous arms went nowhere. Baer builds a case that this was a willful lack of interest resulting from Saudi Arabia’s influence.Saudi Arabia has been allowed to opt out of investigations. Louis Freeh was snubbed in the Khobar Towers investigation; John O'Neil was not permitted by the US State Department from entering Yemen to investigate the USS Cole bombing; The Bin Laden's were not to be interviewed regarding the 911 attack.  Baer cites a personal experience with Qatar's interference with the arrest of Khalid Sheik Muhammed and the fate of Baer's source, the ""black prince"". (Makes you wonder if letting Bin Laden go at Tora Bora was ordered from Riyadh).Baer notes the cracks in this system. There is infighting among the princes. The cost of supporting a lavish lifestyle for an exponentially increasing number of royal princes is growing. Buying friends is getting more expensive.  Its military (though it has never fought in a war – Baer calls it an expensive body guard system) costs are among the highest in the world GDP-wise.  Oil prices are not what they were. The implosion of the royal family or a Wahhabi revolution could reverberate world-wide.While written in 2003, I expect the fundamentals remain. Some assumptions (such as the Muslim Brotherhood being behind almost any terror act you can name) have been proven wrong, but not the overall thesis. I would like to see an update. The rise of ISIS may have threatened the Royal family enough to defy the clerics who are undoubtedly funding them with cash from the royals, extracted from us when we fill our tanks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12E0UOP1VN1QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400052688#wasThisHelpful","R12E0UOP1VN1QR","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paolo Rumiz and his translator/companion/photographer Monika travel light.  With only backpacks and one change of clothes they take trains and buses from northernmost Finland to the Ukraine.  Their route is vertical but often zig zags crossing Russia’s western “border zone”/Europe’s frontier”.Paolo and Monika enjoy most the places tourists visit least.  They acquainted me with remote places such as  Kirkenes (the place of the northernmost internet connection), Monchegorsk (“ the meringue city”) and Karelia ( the start/end of the arctic circle)  the Solovetskys (the monastery islands). Once they cross over to Estonia, Latvia, Kaliningrad, Poland and points further south they see the influence of the EU, the USA and an intense pace of life.The descriptions are wonderful, from the processing of crabs with the 6 foot claws in Kamchatka, to the varied and often ominous border crossings (days long lines for Estonia-Russia) to the curfew for men (not women or boys) in Belarus cities to a shakedown in the Ukraine.Throughout the trip they note synagogues and an historical Jewish presence, but few Jews. They learn that most who survived the war left in 1990’s when visas became easier to get.Through conversations with locals (Paolo says you can't learn what is happening from diplomats in airports) you hear that all are thrilled with the collapse of communism.  Alya Andreyevna morns her job in a now vanished day care center and the team spirit of the past.  She worries that the wooden houses of her town will be bulldozed to make room for cement buildings. Another woman longs for the order of the past and says there is too much drinking now. The market economy is bringing tourists to the arctic who shoot reindeer for only their antlers and people everywhere who exploit the once shared lands.I liked the narratives about people with quotes from the everyday conversations. The best was that of Tatiana and Vitaly of Lovozero glimpsing their lives and showing the worry foreign house guests can cause. The portraits of places were good, but had me going to the internet for orientation (how big is this city? Where, exactly is this?).Despite the depth and beauty of the prose, (kudos to writer and translator) I can’t give it 5 stars. The borderless map was not much of a help and Monika’s photography was frequently cited, but not one picture is included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UVQCBN7JDGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847845427#wasThisHelpful","R26UVQCBN7JDGR","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells the fast moving  story of ISIS up to December 2014, and a bit of early 2015 update.  It has good reference material in that it includes a time line from its origin in 2003, a glossary and a history in short labeled dictionary style entries showing the influences that created this group including the prophet, the caliphate, the Sunni and Shi’a split, Salafism, “Waging War” and a summary (of what the book defines as) “ISIS’s: Radical among Radicals”.The authors are on difficult ground and do well in sticking with what is “probably known” and when it is apt to change. It is well footnoted with current authoritative sources. The authors keep the jargon down  and choose their words very carefully so the history is readable and clear.The first part, the narrative history was the best for me.  There was more on social media and the Twitter battles than I’d have liked, but, as the author’s say, cyberspace is one of the battlefields.  In the end, the problems for policy makers are discussed. Solutions, which run from ""letting them rot on their own"" to major intervention are discussed. The authors recommend some actions at the end.Throughout the book the contrast with Al Qaeda, the organization from which ISIS sprung,  is highlighted.  You come to understand the strengths and vulnerabilities of ISIS and the  problems for not just policy makers today, but also the dim possibility for a civil society for those living in its path.The book gave me insight on how this group emerged, its appeal to young people, how it fits into the terror networks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJE6G89XGT9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062395548#wasThisHelpful","R1VJE6G89XGT9Z","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suki Kim is brave. She went doubly undercover by posing as a Christian teacher so she would be hired by missionaries who were founding the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in North Korea. She knew what she was getting into, her family had been torn apart in the war and grieved of a relative trapped in the North.  She had visited there before.The Missionaries who fund this school are not attempting to proselytize right now.  They are playing a longer game. Their vision is that the country cannot last as it is, and when it falls, they will be there to save the people. North Korea, strapped for funds, gets a school, most likely a fee from the mission and money from the teachers who pay for supplies and field trips and whatever else can be nickel and dimed.The narrative begins with the several pages of rules. While some define water precautions, most of show the extreme surveillance she will live with.  The wealth and achievements of the world outside run counter to the “Leader” mythology and are not to be spoken of.  Students, too, are permitted a narrow range of conversation but random comments reveal that even the elite are not very well off and know little of the world outside.Trips outside the school (a mountain, an apple farm, a shop,  a museum of gifts) are a relief but stressful. Kim sees the pathetic lives of the rural people and notes things that have been staged for their benefit (to the extreme of a church and its service).  This heightened her awareness of what might be behind a “surprise” field trip for her students to a zoo.Since nothing can be directly asked, Kim learns in passing that all other universities in North Korea are closed.  The reason is never discovered, but it may be that the young men are needed for a construction project.  If it is the only university open in the country it can be surmised that this sad group of the sons of the elite are future leaders.While the missionaries have a different goal, their project is one advocated by  Andrei Lankov in The Real North Korea. His view is that the fall of the regime will end badly since the elites have all been compromised. The best soviet satellite’s conversions they were those where there was an untainted elite or sub-elite professional class that provided leadership. While this project has a long way to go, it may create some needed perspective for the country when an opening up finally occurs.This is a short but highly personal page turner. The author has a talk on TEDs that may whet your appetite to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UWZP2QZODUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307720659#wasThisHelpful","R21UWZP2QZODUI","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrei Lankov is a uniquely qualified to write this book. Having grown up in Russia, graduating from Leningrad State University and studying as an exchange student in the 1980’s at Pyongyang Kim Il-sung University, he has lived under communism and the aftermath of dictatorship.  Currently a professor of history at Kookmin University in Seoul, his lifelong research is on North Korea where he has an extensive contacts inside and outside of the county.While on the surface it appears the North Korean’s rulers are bizarre madmen, Lankov shows how their decisions are rational responses to their need to survive and pass on their achievements to their families.  For them, the alternative is unthinkable since they understand that their wealth (at the top) or modest life style (for the “elite”) has been built on the suffering of others.Figures are hard to come by, but there may be a 1:40 disparity in personal wealth of North and South Korea.  This knowledge is far more dangerous than the Chinese under Mao knowing the wealth of Japan, or Brezhnev’s Russians knowing the lifestyle of those in Europe.  Those discrepancies were not as great and could be explained away, but the North/South gap, which gets deeper each year, poses questions about “Great Leader” and “Dear Leader”. Lankov shows how keeping knowledge of the world outside is getting more and more difficult.The comparisons of life in the Kim regimes to life in Stalin’s are most interesting. Lankov describes the different living conditions, mobility, individualism, the penal system, defection, agricultural policy and more. In each category, life under Stalin was comparatively open.  The few breaks in surveillance system are usually from bribing lower level officials, and a sign of change it that this is getting more and more common.Since the country cannot provide for its needs and Soviet largess has dried up, North Korea has become skilled in using threats regarding its nuclear program to extract aid. There are smaller schemes such as bootlegging and counterfeiting.  A few North-South cooperative projects (these have ramifications for information control) are discussed.Lankov concludes with how the regime might end and what can be done to minimize its fall out. Here Lankov uses examples from the changes in different social and political climates in the Soviet satellites fared and the lessons that could be applied to North Korea.While the content is deep, the writing is very accessible.  If you are at all interested in North Korea, how it got this way and what can(‘t) be done about it, this is a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTROUKQK5BNCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199390037#wasThisHelpful","RTROUKQK5BNCJ","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mona Eltahawy is advocating, literally, a sexual revolution in the Middle East. She touches on issues such as voting, employment and access to education, but the main theme is that the social, legal and religious control over women’s bodies and their sexuality needs to change.She provides a survey of the status of laws in the region that permit the indefensibly unjust treatment of women and the flimsy Quranic authority on which they are based.  There have been some small successes at the political level such as the  curbs on female genital mutilation, the push to repeal laws that allow rapists to get off if they marry their victim and election of female parliament members in Kuwait.  Signs that things are changing include lesbian plays in Lebanon, two female Olympic participants from Saudi Arabia and a “kiss-in” in Morocco.There are comparisons to fundamentalists in other religions, particularly in the US. While she doesn’t mention it, witch trials come to mind for their random terror.Eltahawy is at her best when she speaks of her own struggles and how it took 8 years to stop veiling, how she sought out her first sexual experience and how she understands her writing puts her family in an uncomfortable position.She ends with a description of a support group which is fitting for the sub-narrative which is that change begins with women sharing their stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQH5ODETRFE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N04EKU4#wasThisHelpful","R2YQH5ODETRFE9","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eleanor Marx carried on her father's work while living as liberated a life as any woman could for her time.  It appears that she followed her heart, a heart too generous to understand that not all other hearts are honest. Author, Rachel Holmes tells the full story.Holmes begins the narrative with ""Tussy's"" (Eleanor's)  unusual childhood in England. Her parents, Karl and Jenny are political exiles who live with a ""servant"" Lenchen who was an adopted sister to Jenny. (The two girls are said to look alike, but this is not developed.)  Frederik Engels, also from their area of Germany moved to England for family business. They become an extended family. Engels has wealth and basically supports the Marx family.Marx, who has buried two sons, is close to his intellectual and compassionate daughter.  She does his research and copies his illegible handwriting. He declares ""Tussy is me.""  While he is never sexist towards her, he thwarts her young emotional life. She becomes anorexic. For more on the Marx family, I recommend the National Book Award nominated Love and Capital: Karl and Jenny Marx and the Birth of a Revolution by Mary Gabriel.After her parents' deaths, Tussy led life dizzying life of theater, translation, research and labor organizing. She took up her father's mantle and along with other ""radicals"" advocated what we take for granted today: the 8 hour work day, public education, male and female suffrage and a lot more. She was a strong advocate for women's rights. She wrote articles, speeches and her father's biography, translated books, prepared her father's works for printing and created research files, all without a typewriter until 1889 and without electricity until 1995. A huge amount of organizing (the International, gas workers, glass workers, bakers, match makers and more) went on without a phone.She traveled, not only as a popular speaker, but on her own. She maintained close friendships and (unlike her father) related to her Jewish roots. She made a bad choice in living with Edward Aveling a director, actor and theater critic. (Engels similarly made a bad choice in letting Louise Kautsky Freyberger into his life. I look forward to a biographer tacking this relationship.)Holmes is skillful in showing how ""Tussy's""/Eleanor's whole life  is the foreshadowing for two events that will surprise readers (fiction-style) that don't know them. One illustrates the extraordinarily friendship of her parents, Frederick Engels and Helen Demuth, the other shows Tussy's emotional overload.While at times there is more information that the reader can absorb, this is an excellent book. You come to see Eleanor Marx's unusually neglected role in labor history. She is at the center of most organizing at the time and a noted speaker throughout Europe and the US.The ending, not only by nature of the story, but also the skill of the author is very powerful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WL8UCUHVZZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620409704#wasThisHelpful","R5WL8UCUHVZZI","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Horn explores the twists of fate that intertwined George Washington and Robert E. Lee.  It begins with Henry Lee II winning the hand of George Washington’s love and the couple (Henry Lee II and Lucy Grimes Lee)  become Robert E. Lee’s grandparents.  The book ends with Lee’s presidency of George Washington College and a discussion of Arlington and DC based memorials. In between and throughout, you see George Washington looming large in the life of the (essentially fatherless) Robert E. Lee. “Light Horse Harry”, Robert E. Lee’s father, served in the Revolution under Washington, and later at his side in the Whiskey Rebellion. The childless Washington took a paternalistic interest in young officers (most famously, Alexander Hamilton) but not Light Horse Harry.  After the war, Lee invested in land that abutted the Washington’s planned canal. The canal was never built and Light Horse Harry lost the fortune his wife inherited. Lee’s father went into debt and depression and ran away from his problems. With his father in the Caribbean, Lee and his mother and siblings were dependent on the largess of the extended family.Lee married the much sought after Mary Anne Randolf Curtis, Martha Washington’s granddaughter. Upon the death of  George Washington Parke Curtis, the Lees inherited the Arlington Estate where Curtis had kept family and national heirlooms from Mount Vernon. Along with this estate came the slaves (""dower slaves"") that due to restrictions set by the Curtis family could not be freed by Washington when he freed his own. The fate of the heirlooms and the eventual emancipation of the dower slaves are an ironic twists of history.This book sheds no light on reasons Lee left his US Army career for the unknown future of the Confederacy. It does introduce a new variable in showing Lee taking arms against the Union that Washington created.  Lee, himself, has trouble explaining this decision at times saying Washington would have done so too.  As in other biographies, Mary Anne Randolf Curtis Lee is shown to be a Plantation Princess as she writes to Union generals with special requests. The reason for Lee’s decision could be simple as it having been made by his highly partisan Confederate wife.The position of the White House (a Curtis estate, not the POTUS home) and the companionship of John Augustine Washington III (George Washington's brother's grandson) are germane and of interest, but the battle strategies are not needed and detract from the narrative.This book is interesting and fills a niche for Civil War readers.  It adds color to the story of Robert E. Lee and the dimension it adds to Lee's portrait can give psychologists something to chew on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2HPXBIWITTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147674856X#wasThisHelpful","R1L2HPXBIWITTF","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It reads like the academic work that it is.  Author Hazem Kandil studies “how organizations employ their ideals in macro-level power struggles.”  In this work he focuses on how the Muslim Brotherhood attained power over 8 decades of patient building and dramatically lost power in a little over a year.Kandil’s study includes research into published and unpublished sources (inclusive of 17 memoirs) print and AV indoctrination materials, interviews with 77 people (p. 183) with various relationships with the Brotherhood,  6 years attendance at a Brotherhood mosque in California and more.  The result for the reader is a look inside the Brotherhood, including the secret parts, delivered through dense and heavily footnoted prose.The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 with the goal of creating an ideal Muslim society. It was personal and not political. The “ideology” was simple: once all follow Islam as the Brothers define it, God will see that a good life will follow.  Recruitment is careful, most are selected from friends and family of members.In weekly meetings a “cultivation curriculum” (which the author was able to see and cite) is delivered which focuses on obeying/trusting leaders and not criticizing Islam (because that weakens it). The suffering of Brothers is idealized so that recruits understand that to betray the group betrays those who suffered.  Recruits are evaluated on worship, ethics, sociability and commitment.  As one becomes a brother, he (there are a few female groups) cocoons into a family, work/ business and social life revolving around the Brotherhood. Outside reading, media, relationships are discredited, discouraged and often banned.  There are many examples of the indoctrination process.The author’s premise is that a group like this, with no academic heft behind it and no experience in negotiating daily life outside the closed loop of its community would fail.  He shows how, after being late to the Egyptian protests the Brotherhood was able to leverage its nationwide footprint into an electoral victory and how members and leaders were surprised that Egyptians wanted a government to provide security and services, not religious guidance.Kandil concludes with a survey of the Brotherhood and the groups it has spawned around the Middle East and a provocative chapter called “The End of Islam?”.If you are a general reader and want to know about the Brotherhood and you don’t mind a dry academic slog, this book is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGK0FLI8FXV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074568291X#wasThisHelpful","R3HGK0FLI8FXV9","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that this must have been done before. There must be an earlier book focusing on this event for the general reader.  If this is the first, and to my knowledge it is, thank you Barry Strauss for your long overdue work.Strauss believes the conspiracy began a month before the assassination. He describes events that may have triggered it and the personal motives of the plotters.  There are omens read from birds, dreams and weather patterns . You learn of Caesar dismissing his body guards, Calpurnia’s warning and Caesar being late to the meeting.Strauss shows how Shakespeare’s take is buried deep within the lore – the most treacherous ingrate was not Brutus but Decimus.I like how Strauss shows where sources conflict, agree and/or remain silent, especially in describing the assassination, immediate aftermath and the funeral. Again, Strauss reminds the reader that Shakespeare’s plays are fiction, primary sources bring us fragments but point to a whole different oration by Mark Antony.  I was glad that Strauss noted that Cleopatra was in Rome at Caesar’s villa in this period. Other materials drop her for this period.The aftermath covers familiar ground, and is a good summary.This is an excellent book, bringing together all that we know and don’t know with some ideas in the why and commentary on the impact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDHMLH6B4LV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451668791#wasThisHelpful","R1FDHMLH6B4LV1","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beware the old boy network, not just the spies and crooks who connive themselves into top positions, but their unwitting enablers who accept them for merely being, on the exterior “like” them. Author Ben MacIntyre shows how this network’s values of trust and loyalty made it incapable of policing itself.Kim Philby may be the most successful counter-agent ever. He fooled the top spies in Britain and the US.  He believed in communism as a youth and through the purges (inclusive of his handlers) and the growing dysfunction in the Soviet Union he never wavered. He never discussed politics and no one thought that he wouldn't think as they did since had the right family background, accent, education and manners. He was exceptionally charming and “good” at parties.MacIntyre shows how Philby’s instincts were spot on. He knew when to “hold them” “fold them” “walk away” and “run”.Nicholas Elliot of MI6 and James Angleton of the CIA and the others who enabled him paid no consequences for their bad judgment. Those who paid were patriots who died in the undercover operations he betrayed, the agents who informed the west whose names he sent to the Soviets and the many living under the Stalinist rulers he strengthened.  He shattered the life of his second wife  and the consequences for their 5 children and his third wife are unknown.  The impact his treachery had on Angleton did further damage to the CIA.As a further note on the theme of the old boy network, Nicholas Elliot may be the consummate example. When another spy operation (done against the Prime Minister’s directive) goes sour Elliot says the only problem with it was the way PM Anthony Eden handled it. There is no post mortem, no consideration the Philby, guilty or not, who was by this time circumstantially linked to a mountain of disasters, could have been at fault.  The “Afterword” is an interview of Elliot by John LeClarre which reeks of the attitude that enabled Philby.This is an incredible story.  There is a lot on the lifestyle of the British intelligence service of this era and the internal politics. There are photos of just about everyone you want to see. The few times I used the index worked.  While I cheated and went to Wikipedia to know the end of the story, as a testament to the author’s skill, I still stayed up last night to finish it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3Y34DI6UYO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804136653#wasThisHelpful","R3J3Y34DI6UYO1","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chimamda Ngozi Adichie is such a good writer I almost stopped reading her novel.In this first person narrative Kambili Achike describes life with her abusive father.  After 100 pages, I could hardly stand living with him and almost abandoned the book.  It seemed that Adichie would find a way out of this miserable household (this couldn’t be the whole book, could it?) so I stayed with it.This is a character driven story. The abusive father, financially successful, religiously fanatic, politically outspoken and generous with charities cries as he delivers punishment and dominates the story. Through Kambili’s narrative you learn of his relationships with others in the nuclear family and his father and sister.  Enabled by the silence of his victims, the world outside sees Eugene Achike as a model citizen.The narrative builds to an unexpected climax and aftermath.There is a lot here about the uncertainty of living in Nigeria. You see the contrast in the lives of the rich and the “middle class”.It may be that this book is marketed to teens because its narrator is a teen, but the story and the writing have appeal and meaning for all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CIW4D4W0TIY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616202416#wasThisHelpful","R1CIW4D4W0TIY5","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this graphic novel, Marjane Satrapi tells the story of her formative years in Iran. This, like the Barefoot Gen books, shows how this genre can deliver a powerful narrative.All the elements of living in Tehran at the downfall of the shah are shown through the daily life of the family.  You see the demonstrations, indoctrination at school, relatives who have been in prison, the war with Iraq, glorification of martyrs, recruitment of 14 year olds, bombs, propaganda, silencing the opposition to the war in Iraq, the “fashion police”,  obtaining western media, the mass exodus of those who might have reversed the situation and more.From her bio, I see that Satrapi is a descendant of an Emperor of Iran and left Iran as shown in the novel.I don’t know of any other book format that can deliver all this with such power in 153 pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJI08MYWGYN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037571457X#wasThisHelpful","R3IJI08MYWGYN2","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book begins with a dry and hard to follow narrative. Once the fates of the ""Men Who Dared to Execute Charles I"" are finally told, the book is better organized and more interesting.The first part is on capture trial and execution of Charles I. Unfortunately, there is little context since the reasons for the Civil War are not given.  On p. 127 the narrative abruptly switches to the aftermath of Charles I's execution. You don't really know if Charles II is even involved in justice/retribution until page 198 when in another abrupt change you find that he is very involved.While those deemed responsible (the author calls them ""regicides"") were told they would have mercy if they turned themselves in, such mercy for Colonel John Okey was that after being hung he had ""... his head and quartered body retuned for a Christian burial"" (p. 223).  Others, rightfully skeptical of the offer fled.  William Goffe and his father-in-law Edward Whalley cleverly evaded capture in the new world such that their lives, deaths and burial sites are incompletely known.  Colonel Edmund Ludlow moved around Europe and lived to see the Glorious Revolution which did not bring him any relief from the Stuarts.The piety of the ""regicides"" and the bravery of those who aided them comes through.  Many suffered through the Civil War, then again as their dream of Parliament was betrayed by Oliver Cromwell and then again by the wrath of the royalists.This story of the manhunt, lasting decades, and the merciless treatment of the hunted challenges the bon vivant image of Charles II that has come down through history.The book is good as a reference on those who were charged with the beheading of Charles I. It lacks in providing context for Charles I's beheading and Charles II's vengeance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A3P80DOEZJBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620409127#wasThisHelpful","R1A3P80DOEZJBZ","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They rose from varying degrees of poverty to manage multi-million dollar enterprises that had at their roots the ability to command an audience.The title comes from a game played by the three cousins in their small town of Ferriday, Louisiana.  While one cousin (often Jerry) may have ""conquered"" another in these games of ""dare"", in 2015, all the cousins, each with their own stellar achievements and failures, are still standing, and are ""unconquered"".Author, J.D. Davis, shows how their respective home lives influenced their future paths.  Double cousins Jerry and Jimmy are the stars of this book. Their beginnings were more extreme than their cousin Mickey's whose father earned a modest but stable income and was not steeped in the church.  In the later sections, it seemed the material on Mickey was stretched to give him somewhat equal time.This is the author's first and only book.  Because he is a fan I presume the reportorial tone of the book stems from his attempt to keep a neutral voice.  The result takes the color out of these extraordinarily colorful lives.One of the benefits for the modern reader is the ability to access old and new performances, interviews and news stories of the time and now (the multi-media online book is, perhaps, 5 years away) along with the text.I'll be hoping someone will cover this family with an interpretive bio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1MPWBP8ZVG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612540414#wasThisHelpful","RK1MPWBP8ZVG4","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life in Hiroshima in the weeks leading up to the atomic bomb is depicted by cartoonist, Keiji Nakazawa.  He created the 6 year old Gen as his alter ego to show the experience. The book climaxes with the bomb where Gen’s family experience follows that of the Nakazawa family as the author writes in his forwarding note.The portrait shows a hard life in cruel situation. Hunger is the dominant theme. There is great conformity as people parrot their support for the emperor and the honor of dying for him. As an objector to the war, Gen’s father is branded a traitor and life for the family is even more miserable.There are scenes depicting the trials of everyday life, the attempt to fish, grow wheat, catch locusts, rid oneself of lice and make and sell clogs. At school, love for the emperor is taught.Nalazawa shows how life was no better outside of Hiroshima, in the countryside or in the military itself. The portrait of the indoctrination of the kamikaze pilots is chilling.This is a powerful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZNDGXEZDVCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0867196025#wasThisHelpful","R1ZNDGXEZDVCG","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for the recent book on Jerry Lee Lewis and his cousin Jimmy Lee Swaggart, I reserved this book (at the public library) by mistake. Seeing that it did have a chapter on these two curious “celebrities”, I took it anyway.  The chapter on the ""Lee cousins""  as well as those that cover Walker Railey and Madalyn Murray O’Hair are fascinating. The quality of prose and content does not continue; the other three chapters on Anton LeVey, Will Campbell and Matthew Fox seemed to ramble.One advantage of reading these 1990’s contemporary portraits is that through internet searches you can learn that Swaggart and Fox are still preaching as was Campbell until his death. While the strangled Mrs. Railey died in 2012 her probable assailant, Mr. Railey, has managed to stay under the online radar.  LeVey’s and O’Hair’s lives ended, not long after this book’s publication. LeVey” died “normally”; O’Hair in a strange murder/abduction.I think this book suffers in format.  Each of these complex personalities has a short piece, while each really requires a full scale biography. I think it also suffers because Wright has only a loose idea of its purpose.  It isn’t clear why these particular people are selected nor what Wright is trying to say about sainthood and sinning through them.You can see the beginning of Wright as the great writer/journalist he has become.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVC4IKXB04CT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679761632#wasThisHelpful","RVC4IKXB04CT0","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Bell Jar Sylvia Plath told the story of women in publishing, 1950's style, personal and professional.  In this book Joanna Rakoff tells the story, 1990's style, personal and professional.  While their venues are different, both are overqualified glorified secretaries. Both are seeking love. Rakoff and her ""suitors"" have greater knowledge of one another, less parental interference, but not much more satisfaction.RaKoff shines in her description of ""The Agency"" and its staff.  More companies and offices than wish to be counted today were like Rakoff's ""Agency"" in their slow adaptation to photocopiers (too expensive, unreliable, inelegant) and computers (for all the reasons Rakoff's boss gives and more). Many retired when computers were introduced rather than face the changes, so I wasn't ""shocked"" by the typewriters nor the stuffy aura described.  At the end of this year, there are signs that the ""Agency"" is getting with it, but the damage had probably been done.Salinger provides a framework for the narrative and probably the sales for the book.  His famous reclusiveness and the ""Agency's"" role in it are nicely drawn. He is one of several of the striking human interest portraits.In reading J. D. Salinger: A Life I became aware of his war experience which included the Battle of the Bulge, the Normandy campaign, liberation of a concentration camp, the loss of Jewish relatives he had summered with, the interrogation of POWs,  and translation for post-war intelligence and counterintelligence. He had to have been a PTSD sufferer. With this (and other background) I tried (again) to read his fiction. My opinion was well expressed by Rakoff on p. 38.  She later expresses a whole different interpretation that may fit with the author' life experience.I like that the author has waited until the notable characters have passed on making this an historical record and not a tell all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTUU4LVM46RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPVJTAA#wasThisHelpful","R1DTUU4LVM46RR","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I understand that this graphic novel is a portrayal of the author’s own story told through Laura in her role as daughter and care giver.  Short vignettes chronicle  the decline of Lars, her father and Rachel her stepmother. As it begins, Laura checks in frequently but the need for assistance grows to require some temporary live in help and then to nursing home (for Rachel) and hospice visitors (for Lars).  The deaths of Rachel and then Lars are gently portrayed and you see the decisions and grief that follow.There are familiar themes of the elderly, “I want to stay in my house”, “I don’t need any help” hoarding and denial.  The outside world intrudes as the Rodney King riots rage around their home and an earthquake strikes.  Through it all Laura is patient and caring. She makes meals (which her parents don’t eat), bathes Rachel and gently introduces diapers.  Laura takes a lot in stride and has support from her husband.When Rachel has totally exhausted both husband and daughter there is a nursing home, introduced to her as a temporary stay. The experience is a chain of small and large disasters leading up to Lars’ short brush with the medical establishment.This is a beautifully told portrait of elder care, which even under the best of circumstances (Laura seems to have the time, money and family support) is trying and difficult.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2E3C6TIJ8FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606997602#wasThisHelpful","R3B2E3C6TIJ8FL","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fast moving novel will take you on underwater adventures in the Sargasso Sea and Loch Ness laced with romance and a murder mystery.  The story is amplified with bits of marine biology, Scottish history and quotes of probable monster sightings.It’s hard to tell where fact and fiction separate. For instance, How much about ecology of the Loch is real?  Is it an accurate portrayal of how the blasts to build the highway affected the Loch?  Is there a deeper cavern?  I presume the Nessie sightings are fiction; but could some be real quotes?  While the history of Scotland is accurate as I know it, I’m not sure about the influence of the Templars in the highlands.  None of this matters since this is a story but part of me wanted it to be like good historical fiction which injects personalities and motives into the known facts.I had trouble envisioning the look of the monster, the eels and the place of the climax.  While Zach, David and Angus and their interactions are well developed, their relationships with others aren't.  The dialog between Zach and Brandy does not suggest a great romance; Zach and Brandy seem like high schoolers flirting with each other.  It hardly seems like Angus and Teresa are a match for either romance or friendship.The story could be made into a TV movie.  A creative screenwriter could do a lot with the story.  It could be made into an adventure, mystery or horror movie; changing a bit of characters and the plot could make it fun for kids.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XROLF3AK2BKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076536302X#wasThisHelpful","R1XROLF3AK2BKC","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was aware that North Korea kidnapped English and Japanese language teachers to train its spies, but these late 1970's high profile abductions were only vague in my memory.  Through Paul Fischer's gripping narrative you see not only the story of Choi Eun Hee  and Shin Sang Ok , but also, how North Korea is run at the very top. The book piqued my interest in the The Interview [HD], which I saw last night.South Korea's most famous actress and most heralded director/producer were abducted at the behest of Kim Jong Il the son of the then Premier, Kim Il Song. It is Jong Il and his staff who created the North Korean ""brands"", particularly those of his father (""Great Leader"") and himself (""Dear Leader""). They orchestrated the big parades and the imagery we in the west come to associate with North Korea.  In the book you see the author's view that the ""...modern North Korean state ... is a performance production, a display production of its own..."" (p.62).The propaganda that Jong Il cleverly used to pave the way for his ascendance to the premiership (along with pushing aside and discrediting his uncles and other possible candidates) was a product of his interest in film. The films he and his staff created are described as formulaic: extolling the Great Leader; depicting outsiders as vile; glorifying the suffering of the people; fueling paranoia, etc. A fan of western cinema, Jong Il had a library which as described may be one of the most complete in the world.  Since only he could see these films, only he knew how far behind his country was in film production. To remedy this, clever ruses were constructed to abduct this famous team.Choi and Shin are amazing. Shin suffers the consequences of his two escape attempts and Choi endures boredom, gaudy pageantry and lives a false existence. Once Shin ""repents"" of his ways, the author shows their contribution to film in North Korea and how, with the country's economic decline (the famine is only a few years away) plans were made to market films abroad.  These plans, cleverly laid and beautifully acted out by the couple brought them to their freedom.This is a ""can't put it down"" book.  This glimpse of the ""hermit kingdom"" squares with other portrayals in books such as Barbara Demick's Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea and The World Is Bigger Now: An American Journalist's Release from Captivity in North Korea . . . A Remarkable Story of Faith, Family, and Forgiveness and the films such as The Interview [HD] and The Red Chapel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXGCUNZLBG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250054265#wasThisHelpful","R2WXGCUNZLBG5P","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book deals with families and generational response to social changes of post-war America.  Celeste Ng's descriptions of life in the 1950's may help millennials and Xers envision the world its protagonists faced. Marilyn's attempts to be a doctor are as humiliating and exhausting as James' attempts to fit in. Both pressure their daughter to live the life they could not.The time of Marilyn and James' coming of age is defined in part by quotes from the Betty Crocker Cook Book. They may seem funny today, but in the 1950's they were part of the social fabric as was James' attitude towards his wife working.Marilyn's Radcliff education was seen by her mother as preparation for marriage to a Harvard man.  Marilyn has the marriage her mother wanted, but after the wedding they parted to never speak again. James has the career and life his parents dreamed of and they, similarly, are not in the picture.Like their parents Marilyn and James try to realize their unmet goals through their daughter Lydia.  Afraid that her mother would leave, Lydia was desperate to please.  The parents are blinded in their quest and do not see the needs or achievements of their son.  Their other daughter is all but invisible.  The real Lydia is unknown to them.While no one in the family intends to have secrets everyone does. While the children are dealing with the residue of gender and race bias they are not aware of it, nor of their parents' suffering because of it.The plot is that of a murder mystery.  Through it you see that if the parents could have accepted the realities they faced and recognized the unique needs of their own children, this tragedy would have been avoided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDBAXQIL94HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420571X#wasThisHelpful","R1XDBAXQIL94HH","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was just what I was looking for since the election of Pope Francis. It provides a brief history of the Jesuits, an order with a long and complex history.John O'Malley shows how the ideals of the founders continue to guide Jesuits today. Traditional vows of poverty, obedience and chastity were supplemented by a missionary zeal. The monastic life of 1540 (praying, chanting and self flagellation) was not for them.  Jesuits would be in the world.Members worked towards their goals by building schools, not only because they valued education, but also because schools provided a base in the community. Within 100 years, they had an impressive international footprint from Japan, to China to the New World.The most interesting part of this short interesting book is how this order provoked reaction within the church. Jesuit optimism about humanity, their curriculum which included music and dance, their incorporation of local customs into their institutions and perhaps their success was too much for some. The Jansenists was one such group that seemed to have smearing the Jesuits as its reason for being. Dissent resulted in a 1773 papal decree disbanding the order.Fortunately for Jesuit missions, not all countries honored the decree, most notably Catherine the Great's government in Russia. As revolutionary ideas spread through Europe,and people's views of authority changed, monarchs who supported the church (and the church which supported the monarchs) were threatened.  It is in this period that a 1814 papal bull re-instated the Jesuits.The book summarizes the changes in leadership in modern times and how Jesuits have responded to world problems. Added to their mission on education is assistance for refugees and support for ""liberation theology"". The order seemed to be outside of the Vatican loop until 2013 when a Jesuit, to the astonishment of the Jesuits was elected pope.Thank you John O'Malley. This is the book I've been waiting for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNM99F5OGAH4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144223475X#wasThisHelpful","RNM99F5OGAH4V","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles Duhigg's premise is that habits are formed when behaviors are rewarded. Because the brain is wired to anticipate a reward it directs behavior towards getting the reward. The author presents some studies that show brain activity in the anticipation and reward cycles. He poses a ""golden Rule"" of habit change which is to find identify the cue that anticipates the reward and find an alternative route to that reward.  He cites AA, group/team and religious experiences to show that for habits to stick, belief is needed.After describing the thesis the author elaborates on it drawing rather narrow conclusions from research and case studies.Habit is the only explanation given for a study showing the later success of young kids who could wait for two cookies rather than eat one right away.  It would seem that perception of time or visions of the future should also be factors.  Regarding the ""cookie"" and ""radish"" groups in another experiment, can habit really developed in such a short period of time, or was the result about cynicism or a merely an energy rush from sugar? ... and so it goes.While breaking habits is undoubtedly part of change, Duhigg sees his theory everywhere.  He writes as though breaking habits is the only cause of complex organizational change at Alcoa. He attributes marketing success (Pepsodent, Target and creating hit records) to catering to habits, sports victories (the Buccaneers) to ignoring plays and building physical habits and the civil rights movement (the Selma bus boycott) to the habits of association.  Each of these cases is comprised of many factors and teasing out the influence of habit would be a difficult to impossible task.Other sections cover memory loss, gambling habits, the Saddleback Church. While the descriptive writing easy to read, each has many issues embedded besides ""habit"".The value of the book is in the first part where the thesis is described and in the Appendix where how to use the thesis is clearly written.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKMR0BPSOYUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081298160X#wasThisHelpful","R2MKMR0BPSOYUF","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Ackroyd shows how Charlie Chaplin was much more than a Keystone cop or a sad tramp in this overview of his full and difficult life.  Chaplin was also a director, producer, distributor and the founder of United Artists.  He even seems to be a crude pioneer of method acting. While famous for his silent roles, while others clung to the past, he was able to transition to ""talkies"".  In his last film (1967) he embraced color, directing Marlon Brando and Sophia Lauren in the ""Countess From Hong Kong"".He never forgot his roots (for good and bad) as a London street urchin. He both educated and bootstrapped himself to international stardom.  Ackroyd covers his turbulent personal life encompassing his early poverty, the mental problems of his mother, his marriages/principle affairs, his dictatorial demeanor with staff and children (perhaps his wives too), his paternity and Mann Act legal issues, the FBI interest in his ""red"" leanings, his ""flight"" from the US and more.  Through all this, you see how paranoia, sentimentality, and self-absorption are constant throughout his life.The films are described and a bit on their production is given. Three of them, previously unknown to me, stand out for taking on difficult issues.  In Modern Times (1936) describes the plight of industrial workers, in  The Great Dictator (1940) satirizes Hitler (played by Chaplin) before the full horrors of his rule were known and in Monsieur Verdoux (1947) he takes on the post-war military industrial complex.There is a glimpse of his marriage to Oona (who lives on in crossword puzzles) O'Neill.  Through what is available to the public, she seems to be an ideal 1950's style doting wife.  Behind the scenes there is door slamming/locking, abuse of their children and plenty of alcohol.  Not noted here is that she was also the object of J.D. Salinger's affection; he never forgot her. It is hard to say if she made the right choice between these two suitors.There are good photos that match the text. There is an index and a bibliography. Both appear extensive but I didn't use either.Do not expect a full scale biography.  As  defined by the title, Ackroyd condensed this immense life for a general reader. It can be considered an ""Introduction to Charlie Chaplin"".  This life was so full that any of the films, aspects or time periods of his life could fill a book, and as time goes on, undoubtedly will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRUU4L0Y9FBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537379#wasThisHelpful","R1XRUU4L0Y9FBE","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this meticulously researched work, Janice Hadlow describes the family lives of the England's Hanoverian Kings, George I, II, III and IV.  As she sees it, George III made a concerted effort to break with the sordid, feuding and hate-filled lives of  his grandfather and great-grandfather.  Hadlow poses that the ideals implanted by George III reached their fulfillment in what we have come to know as ""Victorian"" and that the standards he set for the British royal family have been a cornerstone in its survival.The first third of the book sets the stage.  The reader sees how George I banished his wife for an affair (while he had many). Her cruelly enforced seclusion was complete; she never saw or heard from her young children. Their son, who grew to be George II, similarly experienced George I's cruelty and was also separated from his children. As king, George II loathed son Frederick who tried to give his son, the future George III, a healthy childhood. While Frederick died too young to see his son fully grown and married (and too soon to accede to the throne) the seeds of a new way were planted.While George's new style of family life did not have the anger of past generations, it was a stultifying mix of isolation and discipline. As a result not one happy person is described in the book.  The Queen who bore 15 children was angry and bitter most of the time.  The King revealed deep depression in his mental illness periods.  The boys rebelled.  That they produced perhaps 50 grandchildren, but only 1 born in wedlock, was clearly an affront to the family values espoused by their father.  Only brief sketches are given of the boys' rebellions. The girls suffered the most and their sad lot is well defined.The girls were closely supervised and tightly controlled. The queen says their tutors should balance their praise with ""uprightness"".  Letters survive from Augusta (the youngest) and Royal  (the oldest) that literally beg their tutor, Mary Hamilton, to love them (p.269-70). In their teens and twenties, any hint of flirtation or romance is cruelly squelched. The girls long to be married. The author seems to feel that the Queen is enforcing the King's wishes (p. 605), but when the King was incapacitated beyond recovery, The Queen fought not just against any marriage proposal but also attendance at various social engagements.The Romanov Sisters: The Lost Lives of the Daughters of Nicholas and Alexandra shows these similarly cloistered teen and younger girls to have the same sweetness, charity and wholesomeness ascribed to these British counterparts. However, the British princesses' letters belie the happiness and calm they project. Few of the letters of the Romanov girls survive to draw their full portraits. Were they to have survived would their lives and happiness have been similarly thwarted?The author shows the impact on the family of losing the 13 American colonies (the King is depressed and it cannot be mentioned), the French Revolution (horror) and the various issues facing Parliament. It can be wordy in areas such as modern opinions on illness (particularly the King's), descriptions of the novels family members read and assassination attempts to name a few.Janice Hanold is to be commended in bringing this all together.  It is recommended for those interested in this family and or the period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLUBW0VBXRRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096566#wasThisHelpful","R1JLUBW0VBXRRZ","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What was it like to be a knight in the age of chivalry? What was it like to be up close and personal to Henry II, his Queen Eleanor and their sons? Thomas Abridge brings it all to life in this engagingly written biography of William Marshall.While born a noble, William Marshall was not a first son. His father supported King Stephen's cousin's claim to the throne and was willing to make William a hostage in the 14 year civil war.  William survived execution orders and the general poor and uncertain conditions of being a hostage.  Perhaps he survived because he was adorable child or maybe because King Stephen was as a sympathetic monarch.Freed upon King Steven's death, the young William was sent to a relative in Normandy where he began his training as a knight. Here the reader learns of the life of ""mesnie"" and the roles and  responsibilities of knights and their lords.  The reader learns how knights were trained and how the expenses of getting and keeping a horse, mail, shields, swords and daily living were met.  While there is a lot on the pomp and pageantry, Marshall's own dubbing was a make shift affair since a battle was expected.Asbridge illustrates the ""career paths"" and options for knights through the Marshall's setbacks.  When Marshall loses his horse and patron he trades his cloak for another (not a war horse, these cost in today's terms as much as a house) and enters tournaments. After building a reputation, some wealth (from prizes) he was ready for war when it came. Through the war he came into the service of Henry II and eventually a trainer for the crown prince, Henry, who is also, technically, a king.  He serves each crowned member of this dysfunctional family as they make war, sometimes on each other.Behind each of the five administrations, Henry II, the shadow King Henry, King Richard I, King John and Henry III  there is William Marshall, attempting to uphold the ideals of chivalry when right and wrong are hardly clear. You see William time and again, choosing loyalty.If you don't know the story of Henry II and his sons it will be a page turner with each battle and episode of intrigue. If you know the story you will learn a lot on the role of the knights in this period and gain perspective on how Henry II's poor parenting begat Richard I and eventually John and the Magna Charta.This is a wonderfully written book.  It is easily accessible for those who don't know about this period and can add perspective for those who do. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in this period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KO0WFOED40KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006226205X#wasThisHelpful","R2KO0WFOED40KX","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The complexity of the Syrian Civil War is illustrated in Appendix 1 which lists the participant groups in the Syrian struggle.  There are 13 mostly armed groups opposed to Assad and 5 pro-Assad, 4 influential Kurdish groups and 4 participating foreign groups. Besides the groups in the Appendix there are countries with official and unofficial participation, policies and interests in the outcome. Reese Erlich, a journalist with many years experience reporting on the area walks the reader through them all in a way you can understand.The there is a short history and then chapters on how an uprising became a war, chemical weapons use, Assad's supporters, the roles of Iran, the Kurds, Israel, Palestine, Russia and the US.  The Syrian people rate highly in this book, but they seem to the incidental to the conflict.  They get fired upon and gassed and the blame or credit (depending which side you are on) is leveled at different sides with evidence to prove different points.Erlich writes that pro-Assad support comes from Russia and Iran who have business interests in Syria and the anti-Assad support comes from wealthy jihad donors, to whom the ""rebels"" demonstrate their pious bona fides.  The UN assists with humanitarian aid and fact finding work.  What the US taxpayer has funded is not clear.There are visits to places where the author gives short accounts and interviews. The most interesting of this are trips to Gaza, the Golan Heights and the Kurdish areas of Syria.There is little on the sub-title ""What the World Can Expect"".  Basically this is that the war will end some day. Erlich cites the end of Lebanon's civil war and Syria's recent history of religious tolerance as hopeful precedents for this resulting in a civil society.The chronology at the end is helpful.Any book with an introduction by Noam Chomsky will be accused of leftist bias. Here, but for a few asides, there is little opinion. Erlich stays with facts and what his named sources tell him.I recommend this book for those like me, who felt the need for more background to understand what is happening and what is at stake.  Even with this background I would find explaining it to others daunting.  This is a very well presented guide to the issues posed by the Syrian Civil War.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHWJBNLS6C8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616149485#wasThisHelpful","REHWJBNLS6C8J","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emerson Baker tells the story of the Salem Witch Trials giving background of the political situation, the process, victims, the accusers, the judges and the aftermath. The end covers the images of Salem and witchcraft in literature and popular culture.The author notes that while Salem has become synonymous with witch hunts, its 19 deaths pale before the fifty thousand put to death for it in Europe and America between 1400 and 1775. In Cologne alone, over 2,000 “witches” were executed in a 10 year period. Salem witch hunts come at the end of this ""age"" of witch hunting. In the US, they usher in the demise of the social position and political power of the PuritansBaker describes a few theories about why it happened in Salem at this time. He believes there it resulted from a “perfect storm” of social and political conditions and personalities. One element was a costly war against the alliance of the French and Indians. Another was that areas within its charter were seeking to break away and form their own municipalities. Higher taxes had to be paid in poor crop years. The center of social life in the community, the Puritan church, produced a depressing stream of rhetoric. The leaders of the church in Salem had contentious personalities making it even more difficult to recruit its pastor. The man they were able to recruit did not have the leadership skills required for the job.The symptoms that the accusers attributed to witchcraft may be what has since come to be known as “conversion disorder”. Death, illness, poverty, lack of stable relationships can bring on twitching, spasms, stuttering and lack of control for instance a chin jutting out or head jerking. One documented outbreak (2011-2012) was in Le Roy NY where poverty and population decline joined with family problems that may have brought on these symptoms in young girls.Most interesting to me were the character portraits of those involved. Little is known of the women, who were most of both accusers and victims. Rev. Samuel Parris led a fascinating, but miserable life. The three generations of Mather’s are astounding for their audacity. Thomas Maule is a name that should not be lost to history.The end is a narrative on the history of Salem how it has fared as a city and its familiar imagery in literature and films. While it is a clear description on how Salem’s image evolved, it does not explain “Why Salem?” and “Why not Cologne?”.This is a very thorough treatment. While it is readable there are pages that read like a reference book of isolated entries. The index is very helpful and at the end there are charts of the accused and their fate in Essex County MA. I recommend this for those interested in this topic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWT9DGE13BX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019989034X#wasThisHelpful","R1CWT9DGE13BX7","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a life so big that 800+ pages can hardly contain it. Philip Dwyer started a more feasible format in: Napoleon: Path To Power 1769  1799 V. 1 several years ago. Full books have been written about single weeks in his life.  Andrew Roberts is to be saluted not only for his research, but for his ability to condense the outsized story of Napoleon Bonaparte into one book.Roberts brings out the best in his subject. He shows Napoleon's acts of empathy, his ability to converse with the distinguished thinkers of his day, his Code and its long lasting effects, his connection with his troops and brilliance on the battlefield.  He abbreviates the bad, for instance writing that he left his troops in Egypt ""without orders"" rather than say he abandoned them.I was struck on how well Napoleon fits Malcolm Gladwell's theory expressed in Outliers: The Story of Success.  While experienced in political turmoil, Napoleon's family was distant from France where/when standing with one side meant persecution when the other side came to power. His dubious noble status could be played either way in the time when nobility as a requirement of generalship was questioned.  With his education, ambition and determination he was able to excel in a career (general/emperor) that could only be obtained/created by commoners in Europe in this sliver of time.While the actual battles are the least of my historical interests the story can't be told without them. Roberts does a good job with context, logistics (although he along with everyone else leaves to the imagination what is done with 20,000 POWs) and strategy.  There are clear maps of campaign routes and battle positions.  The discussion culminates with Waterloo, where, after you understand the brilliance of Napoleon's previous career you understand, logistically what went wrong.  This leaves you to guess about Napoleon's health (you learn of his weight gain on Elba and perhaps a hemorrhoid problem that interferes with his horsemanship) and mental state (he has only 3 Marshalls from the past, the others have died or betrayed him).I learned a lot from small things (Napoleon wrote novels in his youth and Josephine's teeth were black from sugar cane) to large (the unusual ""friendship"" of Napoleon and Alexander I and the ""unforced errors"" of Waterloo). While the section on the Louisiana Purchase in only 2-3 pages, I know more clearly his motives which show the far reach of his thinking (distant colonies will only rebel, better to let the Americans drain the British with them). The treatment of Spain and Portugal is the best I've read. The Moscow episode and retreat is so heart-wrenching, you forget that Napoleon was the aggressor.  The cast is so large that in the Epilogue, there were so many whose names I'd forgotten, I stopped checking the index.While the character of Napoleon remains cryptic, the excerpts from his letters and diaries are helpful. From the preface you learn that newly available primary sources were used.  The layout of the ""Notes"" makes it difficult to find which ones the new ones are and/or to use the ""Notes"" in general.There are many color plates including portraits of the principals and renditions of the battles, treaty signings, buildings, caricatures, possessions.  The Index got me everywhere I needed to go.I could spend a year finding sources and reading biographies of the colorful people of this era.  Of the French, the most intriguing are Talleyrand and Marshalls Nye and Bernadotte; of the Corsicans any member of Napoleon's family; and of the opponents, the Duke of Wellington and Alexander I.This is a notable assemblage of the life of Napoleon.  I am uncertain if its positive spin is the result of weeding out a lot of previously covered material or the weeding out of previous bias.  Writers of these ""big"" biographies have to make decisions on how to present facts to make them readable.  In this bio, sometimes the facts won making many areas a cumbersome read; nevertheless, I stayed with it and I am glad I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8F47DI6U3E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025321#wasThisHelpful","R3C8F47DI6U3E0","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seymour Morris, Jr. was an entrepreneur and a management consultant before he was an author. This background informs his look at General Douglas MacArthur’s leadership in the occupancy of Japan.  He is clearly a fan.Management consultants look for results, and MacArthur’s are extraordinary. In 5 years he changed Japan from a foe to friend.  Its economy is now one of the largest in the world and the de-militarization has lasted to today. Morris sees the MacArthur’s focus on the occupation’s goals and his clear articulation of what was expected to personnel as key in its success.MacArthur was no stranger to occupation.  His father had led the occupation of the Philippines and he, himself, was a student of war and peace.  He instinctively knew how to set the tone (the unarmed landing at Atsuji and the staging of the surrender) and knew that the emperor had to be spared so that he could be used. The empowerment of women was, from the beginning, key to the demilitarization.There are chapters covering the different aspects of occupation. One chapter on a side but important issue told of the logistics of repatriating people in Japan at the war’s end to their home countries.  Another chapter “Where is Ishii?” had new (to me) information on Japan’s biological weapons project. I was not aware of Pingfang and was amazed at its scope.Throughout the book there is reference to Russia who joined the war against Japan at the eleventh hour and tried to get its spoils. Morris writes that Russia held its POWs from Japan and elsewhere after the war and released them as they were re-educated; with many not released. Morris credit’s MacArthur’s support for building labor unions as one of the reasons communism was not able to get a foot hold in Japan. At the book’s end, Japan is assisting the US in fighting the Korean War, a proxy war with Russia.MacArthur, with a few exceptions for key people, seemed to keep a distance from the war crimes trials. I was not aware of their extent.At the end there are some comments on modern Japan. The most interesting for me being that the history of WW2 has been reduced to 6 pages in school texts in Japan and that in the discussion of MacArthur and his legacy Morris notes that he warned JFK not to go into Vietnam and considered the domino theory ridiculous.I’ve been waiting for a good book on the Occupation of Japan and Morris has delivered the best one yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VY2ADZZMINBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062287931#wasThisHelpful","R1VY2ADZZMINBC","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm waiting for a full scale biography of this artist, but in the meanwhile, this catalog of a recent  exhibition at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art will have to do. Marina Pacini, the museum's Chief Curator and Curator of American Modern and Contemporary Art its editor/contributor gets high marks from me for the exhibit (which I would love to have seen) her two essay contributions to the book, and the wonderful photographs representing the wide range of this artist.The works are organized into six sections, each with an essay. The strongest essays are by Pacini on Marisol's biography and her theme of family and by Deborah Cullen on Marisol's Latin American influence.Most of the 164 figures are in color.  The ones selected for full pages are the ones you want to see. Collectively  they show the wide range of Marisol's work. I was unaware of the drawings and the heavy De Kooning influence.I (and many others I'm sure) don't usually read catalogs cover to cover.  With the dearth of available material on Marisol, I wanted a good text and was disappointed with much of it. The ""Voice Behind the Content"" essay begins by criticizing Gloria Steinem for noting that Marisol rarely speaks and feels that her work speaks for her, and then goes on to develop the criticized point.  In the section on Marisol's Indians, the writer devotes more space to the photos on which the Marisol work is based than on Marisol's work. There is no explanation why only North and not South American Indians are portrayed. Perhaps Marisol did no South American Indians, but from essay on Latin American influence essay, you would expect that she had. The ""Musings"" essay rambles.  As with any collection of essays, the work does not always hold together when assembled. There are 3 tellings of the story of Marisol and her mask.Check this out for the retrospective of Marisol's work. While you may not be familiar with the all items shown, it is a broad representation.  If you read the text you will you will learn something about this ""Garbo"" of the art world but you will be hungry for more.

"There is very little fiction covering the contemporary Latino immigrant experience so this book may have made the 2014 New York Times Notables List for its content. While the story is good, there is no subtly. The author's purpose may be to show the goodness of the ""unknown Americans"", but the characters are not well developed and the details of their lives are not realistic.Can it really be that a successful couple in Mexico who has researched US schools for special needs students, found a job near that school, figured out the visa system, and arranged an apartment has not prepared themselves for their trip with even a few phrases of English?  When they moved their household in a truck, did they really have room to acquire a TV and a mattress along the way?  Can a diner cook really support a family of four in a single household? These are only a few of the problems in realism with this book.The author shows several instances when parents keep their children in the dark. Rafael was not direct in telling Major want he learned at school. Alma does not help Maribel understand the assault.  At the end Alma leaves Maribel guessing about something significant and life changing for her about her father, which Maribel (probably because she was kept in the dark) had not even considered at that point; Rafael leaves his son guessing about Maribel's father for far too long.A number of first person narratives are used, perhaps to fit the title, but they do not relate to the story. Space devoted to this would have been better used in developing the characters and showing perspective on the culture and the family dynamic.There have been some excellent non-fiction narratives on the contemporary immigrant experience such as those in Matt Taibbi's The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap . There have been only a few other cuts at this material in fiction, most notable being The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao .  I think that the many favorable reviews here represent a hunger for fiction relating the the Latino immigrant experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT664ST2BGGQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350848#wasThisHelpful","RT664ST2BGGQG","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who was Vladimir Chertkov and why did he attach himself to Leo Tolstoy and a movement so at odds with his aristocratic standing and his lifestyle?  This book will make you even more curious about the answers.The questions begin early on.  Like many of his aristocratic peers, he was able to do most anything financially, but his access to royal favor is staggering.  Was he the bastard son of Alexander II?  The Wikipedia portraits of the two men strongly suggest this is so. Sophia Tolstoy claimed to recognize and cadence his voice in the voice of Alexander III, whom, again checking Wikipedia, Chertkov also resembles.What was his motivation in attaching himself to Tolstoy and his movement?  Was he a ""groupie"" to the rock star of his time?  Was he working for the tsar's secret police?  His family participated in what seems to be a fundamentalist Christian movement.  Did the youthful Chertkov have idealism? Guilt? Altruism?  Was Tolstoy the love of his life? Was Tolstoy being manipulated for status, for favor with the tsar? Was the manipulation merely for Chertktov's own sadistic pleasure? Was cashing in on Tolstoy's copyrights from the start?We can conclude some things about his personality, the two most salient being his incredible power of persuasion and his lifelong lack of empathy.How Cherktov survived and thrived in Stalin's Russia needs a more thorough treatment.  There is surely more to know about how he convinced Stalin to grant him a full bureaucracy devoted to publishing a work so at odds with Stalinism. There is only an outline on how he got preferred housing, first class rations, a budget, space and staff for his work, support for an artistic community and travel privileges for his son. He got to have paintings and a sculpture made of himself.  He was able to keep documents that would cost others their lives.  Can it be that Popoff has uncovered all that is knowable?Sophia Tolstoy and her suffering are in the background here.  This book should be read in tandem with Popoff`s Sophia Tolstoy: A Biography to get a full portrait of the effects of Chertkov's corrosive partnership with her husband.I first became aware of Chertkov through Paul Giamatti's rendering of him in The Last Station, a film I will have to see again with this added background.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PPB1GAS148T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605986402#wasThisHelpful","R24PPB1GAS148T","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two interesting things I learned about De Niro were that while he plays a convincing Mafiosa, he would never be a ""made man"" (only ¼ Italian and culturally more Bohemian NYC than ethnic) and a lot of his films lost money... a lot of money... even award winning films.The first part, the description of De Niro's childhood, pulls you in.  He lives with his artist, poet, activist, typing and real estate entrepreneur mother and visits his father (a credible, but mostly starving artist) in his nearby studio.As De Niro becomes an actor you see how his single minded devotion to his craft (like his father before him) runs from collecting costumes to sculpting his body for a role, most famously, Jake LaMotta's fighting body and then its dissipation.  De Niro's attention to detail is enormous. His learning Sicilian is just one preparatory element as he studies Brando's ""Godfather"" to bring the character backward in time.  He records and practices regional dialects for US roles.  He learns to play the saxophone and studies everything from horseback riding to prison culture, to cop culture, to the mentally ill and illiterate for his roles. For the role of Al Capone, Capone's own tailor was enlisted to make his suits and De Niro wore Capone's style of underwear.There are interesting stories about how some of the films were made and not made. Some of the roles were filled with people merely glimpsed and brought in for screen tests. There are De Niro and Scorsese family members in background scenes.  There is the ""discovery"" of the boy actor, Leonardo DiCaprio.Because the book is like an annotated filmography, the last third or so of the book is not as strong as the first reflecting De Niro lesser creative choices.De Niro is famously elusive, shunning interviews and his public speeches are noticeably terse. Much of his personal life comes from public records, such real estate transactions,  messy child custody/divorce actions; his potential use of a prostitute; contract performance insurance related to his prostate cancer; large (the owner of the gallery where his father sold his paintings stole $2+ million of them) and small (the housekeeper taking jewelry and clothing) theft and more.There are other bios of De Niro. I don't know how this one stacks up.

"This is a good book for those who (like me before reading it) know only a few facts about William Tecumseh Sherman.  Robert O'Connell gives a good outline of his highly eventful life showing him to be a military man through and through. He likes people, theater, the Union and winning. He has a great sense of geography which enhances his strategic thinking.  He knows how to cut losses and thereby save lives.It is a book of surprises.  The first one was on p. 5, a drawing Sherman made as a Cadet at West Point.  Other surprises are Sherman's banking career, his role in the discovery of CA gold, his marriage to his foster sister, his powerful political family (his brother is the Sherman of the anti-trust legislation), his leadership in a Louisiana military academy,  his affair with Vinnie Ream, his son's entry into the priesthood and more. The last surprise is General Joseph Johnston serving as a his pall bearer.I appreciated the early discussion on the West Point curriculum, what it was and what it wasn't.  The professional relationships of Sherman and Henry Halleck and General Grant are well drawn.  Sherman's planning for and execution of the Atlanta Campaign and the March to the Sea it are good summaries for the general reader as are the occupations of Memphis and Savanah.  The ""March"" was quite different than I envisioned it.O'Connell shows a more enlightened man than the image of brutality that often surrounds his name. He is ferocious on behalf of the Union but when towns surrender, their people are treated as fellow citizens. His war is his passionate defense of the Union. His liberation of slaves is to strike at the plantation owners who tore the Union apart.  Having newly freed men give him information, assist on campaigns, he comes to be ahead of his time on race and race relations.  His marchers at the Grand Review include the Blacks who worked along with his troops.The book is arranged such that the career history is separate from the personal life.  This seemed to create two different Sherman's. In the career part he is pictured as a ""good"" husband and family man (despite his wife Ellen's father's demands and her strong religious commitment) although his work keeps him many miles and many months away from the family.  The second part shows the couple's quarrels over money, religion and Sherman's affairs making hard to imagine a successful marriage.The author does not address Sherman's middle name and it is not clear if Tecumseh was his first name, changed to his second by his foster father, Thomas Ewing.  Whether it was his first or middle name, why would Charles Sherman name his son for a Shawnee leader (p.272) ""determined to prevent white encroachment""?  O'Connell calls Sherman (p.xix) ""virtually a human embodiment of Manifest Destiny"" without irony.  Whatever the issues, Sherman must have been attached to this unusual name and gives it to his son, known as P. Tecumseh Sherman.O'Connell succeeds in showing Sherman's complexity, his major role in keeping the Union united and then tying it together via the railroad. You come to see Sherman without the war crimes baggage and think of him as O'Connell does:  as one of the few historical figures who would fit right into the current age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8Z0E3X5AS83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069726#wasThisHelpful","R1R8Z0E3X5AS83","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unconventional artist needs an unconventional book.  Author Leil Liebovitz has delivered, mixing his chronology with artistic and social commentary.  You learn how Leonard Cohen was shaped by his Jewish heritage and his Canadian upbringing, how he became a poet and how he put the poems to music. At times the author is as poetic as his subject.The book has only 246 short pages.  The content is good but not all of it is on Cohen. There are pages devoted to related subjects such as Canadian literature, Jewish history and Bob Dylan.  In the first chapter ""Prelude"", Cohen does not emerge for 12 pages.There are some good insights such as the difference in Canadian and American artists, the concept of ""duende"" (which suits Cohen's voice and content) and Cohen's views on his work.  There are amazing episodes such as the visit to/escape from Cuba, recording with Phil Spector (dinner with Phil Spector!) and the two performance tours in Israel.Liebovitz, in some places uses Cohen's own words to describe him.  His opening to his audience in Poland shows how he refuses to be used by anyone (to me, they related to the episode where Dylan seems to expect Cohen to perform at his concert); his speech in support of the Bereaved Parents for Peace in Israel shows his long apolitical view; and his reflection on the embezzlement of most of his assets show his forgiveness and resilience.Each chapter is introduced with a full page photo of Cohen, so you watch him mature. As of this writing he is 80 and has maintained audiences through at least 4 generations (depending on how you count, maybe 5).  He has just released a new album and in 2013 performed in tours in Europe and the US.If you are a fan of Cohen you probably know all the biographical material that is eliminated or pruned and will appreciate the commentary and insight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FHOYBDACI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393082059#wasThisHelpful","R24FHOYBDACI","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hotel of the intriguing title is in the background as the horror and tragedy of the Spanish Civil War is shown through the stories of three couples.Arturo Barea is juggling a wife and a mistress at the beginning of the war when he falls in love with Ilsa Kulcsar.  Ilsa, a leftist activist from Austria, left her marriage to go to Madrid for the anti-fascist cause. Robert Capa from Hungary and Gerda Tam of Poland met in Paris, the first destination for anti-fascist expats on their way to Spain. Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain in part of the republican cause and in part for romantic (with both small and capital ""r""s) adventure.  Marsha Gellhorn a writer in her own right, traveled with her famous writer partner Hemingway to cover the war.  These women show bravery, commitment, and enterprise, at least equal and maybe greater than their more famous partners.In the beginning the expat situation is defined by Barea as he opines that they were ""self-satisfied posers, playing at helping the war effort; they didn't really care what happened to Spain."" This is borne out by the accounts of lunches, dinners, shopping and furs.  As the war grinds on, these accounts wane (although where there is Hemingway, there is booze) and many of the expats show enormous courage.  Gerda gives her life and everyone but Hemingway takes significant risks with theirs.This author has done a very good job.  The war itself has a simple premise: should a general be able to make war on his country's democracy in order to attain power?  Unfortunately the politics of it, so well portrayed in this book as seen through the experiences of these 6 people, were not so straightforward.While the writing is good throughout, it does take a while to get into the narrative and there are a few lulls.  Overall, the book is riveting because you come to understand and care about the characters and the deplorable abandonment of Spain by the world's leading democracies (who later had to face the war with fascism they had tried to avoid in Spain). The ending describing the stream of refugees and the purges that followed overwhelmed me.There are good photos, several showing the power of Capa and Tam's work.  The index got me all the info I needed. The list of principal characters is helpful.This is a heavy read and an achievement for the author. It is recommended for those interested in this period and/or the 6 people profiled.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8MZ29FWY58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374172994#wasThisHelpful","RF8MZ29FWY58","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coming of age stories for males focus on sex - that is the act of sex - with relationships minimized and often lampooned.  For women the stories are more complex and there might not be any sex.  Relationships with family, the neighborhood, friends and the pecking order at school are front and center as is reputation since it can disappear from jealous actions, rebuffed suitors or idle gossip.  Elena Ferrente brings all this to life in her story of two friends growing up in a small town, just outside of Naples.It begins with so many characters that if there weren't a Character Index, I might have had to take notes to keep it straight. If it had not been Naples, and had there not been compelling reader reviews, I might not have stayed with it. The glimmer of the complex novel this becomes does not emerge until after page 75 when the narrator considers Lila's motives for playing hooky.As the book unfolds, you see the background, the baggage and the harsh reality of the lives of Elena Greco and Lila Cerullo. Both girls have an escape route (Elena through education; Lila through marriage) but do they really?  Despite the violence and emotional abuse of their parents, the girls are pulled to them.  The parents tear down their daughters, and what assistance is offered grudgingly results from the interest of outsiders.While relationships as portrayed are timeless, there is a lot that is particular to the time and place.  Despite being walking distance to Naples, this town is so isolated such that some of Elena's friends have not heard of high school. The curriculum of Latin and Greek is hardly useful and very dated. Shoe making and shoe repair (the Cerullo family business) are no longer viable businesses in our throw away culture.  There were victims and winners of the fascist period and the war. While Elena and her friends did not experience this violent history, there is plenty of violence in the town and the specter of ill-gotten gains hovers over some relationships.I'm hooked.  I await the second book  (The Story of a New Name (Neapolitan Novels)) in the series which I've reserved at our State Library.  That I am #9 in a queue of people in Hawaii waiting for this two year old book, translated from Italian about a small town near Naples, says something about  the power of this narrative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBCWJH0GHTR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609450787#wasThisHelpful","RVBCWJH0GHTR0","APTVNT7U6RZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APTVNT7U6RZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an awesome little bookshelf set.Sound wise:I'm very happy with the sound that is coming out of this system.  It feels full and rich while the highs are quite articulated.  Is this system going to compete output-wise with large bookshelf speakers powered by a dedicated receiver?  No it won't win the volume wars, especially of the speakers and receivers are quality components, but that should be expected.  Still, this system will sound just as good as some of those systems in smaller spaces and absolutely runs rings around those portable Bluetooth systems that seem to be all the rage right now.Design:Classic is the best way to describe this.  Handsome piano gloss-black speakers and a simple, understated main unit in matte aluminum.  Design preference is very personal, but the design here replicates some of the best, in my opinion, looks of the old ""hi-fi"" era.  I really like the looks of the this system.  It goes great in a office or in a dining room or in a small apartment, blending very well with a modern deco.Features:* CD player* Bluetooth* Apple lightening-adapter docking station* USB input* Radio* AirPlay functionality* DLNA compatible* Simple effective remote included (includes batteries.)All work great and setting up you network is very easy, especially if you use your iPhone/iPad to import your network settings.  If I had a small gripe, it would be that unlike my Denon receiver, off is really off.  This means you need to power the unit on before attempting to use Airplay.  Not a big deal but if you are used to your receiver being in a constant ""ready state"", then just be sure to be aware of this.Summary:I love this unit.  It sounds great, works well, and looks quite nice in my opinion.  I currently have mine set up as my dinner party system and am happy to finally provide great music quality for guests.  And for myself when tooling around in that room.  Ok, it's more for me and I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R191DE7LP45S5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9IPRK0#wasThisHelpful","R191DE7LP45S5R","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First let me say that I generally love Aveeno and that it's my go-to in the winter for dry-chapped hands.That said, I really dislike this face wash/scrub as it is like they crossed a face lotion with a face wash and through in some mild exfoliators.  I just don't feel like I've cleansed my face after using this and yet I still need to out lotion on it after I shower.  Additionally, my wife who has completely different skin than I do doesn't like it either.

"This is a fairly basic product, so the questions are really:Does it work? Does it look nice?The quick answer to both is yes.  The machined aluminum dock is quite handsome with a modern aesthetic.  It seems well built and it is compatible with my 5S and my wife's 5C. There is space enough to accommodate a thin-ish case and pivots just enough to not put pressure on the lightening connector when not in a case.But there's the rub, it only works with ""open-bottom"" cases, i.e. cases that don't wrap around the bottom leaving only a small opening for the lightening connector. I really wish this dock worked with a greater variety of cases as neither mine or my wife's case is this style meaning we have to take the phone out of the case to use the stand.  Upgrade season is here so we'll keep all of this in mind when getting cases for the new phones.Summary:Great looking and functional docking stand that is case dependent which is my only major complaint.  If you have a compatible case, or no case at all, then this stand will work for you, otherwise you might want to consider a different stand or a new case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T80TYOS8VNPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","R2T80TYOS8VNPQ","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cool little product that does a decent to good job of what it is intended to do, i.e. be a very portable presentation quality projector.  So here are the pros and cons of this unit as I see them.Pros:* Very compact.  The projector is downright tiny, roughly the size of one of the new ""phablet"" phone/tablets that Samsung and Apple now make but just a little thicker.  This means the device will fit very nicely into a bag or even a pocket considerably reducing the weight you need to carry when making presentations on the go.* Auto-focus.  I found the auto-focus technology to work well.* Manual image correction.  There is a plethora of image correction adjustments for keystone, focus, color, etc.  That said, I found one of the preset keystone auto-correct settings to work perfectly.Cons:* Low light output.  I'm not sure why others are reporting excellent light output, I found I needed to run my unit with all lights off to get a viewable image.  This was tested in battery powered mode.* Toggle/select control scheme.  All controls other than power are selected via a single toggle to scroll, press to select switch. I found this control scheme to be a complete pain.  sure it is very compact but I had a hard time getting press to select to work while not accidentally toggling to another choice.  Splitting up the two would have been a much much better and user friendly control scheme in my opinion.* Slightly blurred image.  The crispness of the image just wasn't there when comparing to the Epson projector of the same resolution (roughly 720p) I received at the same time.  It was perfectly acceptable for slides and presentations but smaller print, like a word doc not zoomed in was borderline illegible.* Included ""stand"" is terrible.  The stand is really just a plastic piece that you can attach to an edge to raise when using in horizontal mode (wall projection) or keep upright (ceiling projection).  In ceiling projection mode it doesn't work at all, and in wall projection mode it barely works if you can manage not to bump it.  All of this is made worse since there are no rubber bumpers on any other these pieces, stand or projector to keep it from sliding around on the table especially when not using wireless mode.Summary:The technology behind this device is incredible, but the sacrifices made to get here make it tough to recommend to anyone looking for something other than an ultra-portable projector.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZ8TIXPNYZE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CCT1XW#wasThisHelpful","R3DZ8TIXPNYZE4","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice budget ""all-in-one"" convertible car seat.  Here are the pros and cons of this seat as I see them with comparisons to the Graco 4Ever car seat.Pros:* All-in-One design.  Designed to go from a fully rear facing baby seat (5-40 lbs) to a front facing toddler seat (22-65 lbs) to a belt positioning booster (40-100 lbs.* Soft material.  Softer than the material on the Graco though the Graco feels like it would be more durable in the long run.  This has a bit of a polyester feel but should be fine on babies skin.* Handsome color scheme.  The gray on gray on black looks quite good in person in my opinion.* Height adjustable without having to take apart or rethread the car seat.* Shoulder harness clips to keep them out of the way when loading baby into the seat.  These can be pretty handy and are something that the Graco lacks.* Weight.  It weighs a LOT less than the Graco 4Ever.* Harness is easy to tighten and loosen.  Maybe a touch stiffer than the Graco but not much.* 2 cup holders* No intrusive decorative piping on the armrest or side bolsters.Cons:* Only 3 recline positions.  Not a lot of adjustment in either rear or front facing modes.* Fewer height adjustment positions than the GracoDebatable:* Cup holders are molded rubber meaning they are very flexible and feel somewhat unsubstantial.* Height adjustment mechanism works perfectly fine but the execution is much less refined than the Graco.* I'm not a huge fan of having a car seat that is designed to fit an 8 year old padded up to fit a baby.  These are designed and tested to meet those needs but it's just something I personally have a hard time coming to terms with.Summary:This is a perfectly functional car seat that is comparable to the Graco 4Ever seat in function but designed to be sold a lower price point.  If function is your greatest concern with weight being just as important this is worthy seat for consideration.  If you are looking for greater refinement in execution and functionality and are willing to pay for it, the Graco is one to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V63APK6V7I2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KFDKB0#wasThisHelpful","R1V63APK6V7I2C","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a phenomenal projector.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* Bright.  Really bright.  In a darkened room the brightness was on par with some of the best rear projection DLP TVs of the recent past or even movie theaters.* Color representation.  Colors were vibrant and far from the muted colors that are so common with low end DLP TVs and projectors.* Crisp clear image.  Yes, the resolution is _only_ 1280x800 WXGA (close to 720P but with a little more space vertically) but it looked great.  Watched some Pixar Brave (iTunes version so the resolution was only 720P anyway) and reviewed some photos I took with my DSLR.  The photos did look better on the 4K monitor I have but they looked really great and the movie actually looked better on the projector than on my laptop.  Maybe it was the distance, or the matching resolution but I would prefer watching these movies on this projector than on my laptop screen if pressed to choose between the two.* Speaker.  Was actually very surprised about how well the speaker on this projector sounded.  Projectors aren't known for their speakers but if my only options were my laptop speakers or the projector speaker, the projector speaker wins easily.* Keystone and other image correction.  Buttons for keystone correction and a slider are all easily accessible without having to dive into the menus and they work very well.* Compact.  Projectors have been getting more compact over the years which wouldn't make it all that noteworthy here except for the pro-level brightness that is packed in this relatively tiny package.* Wireless connectivity with easy setup QR code* MHL compatibility to charge and connect your MHL-compliant devices.* Connection options including HDMI, USB, and standard monitor connector.* Cables are included, USB, power, and standard monitor cable.* Remote included (with batteries)* Padded travel caseCons:* I don't really have any as I had no real issue with any of the performance aspects of this projector.  Could it be smaller or brighter or be 1080P?  Sure and they make those but at an increased cost.  So what this projector is spec'd at it does a phenomenal job.Summary:This is a great projector that is designed for office presentations in tough lighting situations, but it's compact and bright enough to double as a home movie projector or for picture slideshows based on it's image and color quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37B2GDE7RLZB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYNAW#wasThisHelpful","R37B2GDE7RLZB9","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun strategy game where the strategy with a different take on strategy.Basics of the game:Goal- This is a card based game where you use a set of four character cards to continually work at defeating dragon cards in order to get their treasure - think a bunch of Smogs from The Hobbit.Play mechanics - you are dealt 4 adventurer cards that you use to attack any of four dragons cards on each turn.  Each adventurer (warrior, thief, wizard, etc.) has a different attack value and each dragon has a set of health points.  Once enough adventurer cards are played on a dragon that dragon is defeated and the loot is won.  A dragon can be defeated by a single player or a group of players.  It's when it is defeated by a group of players that things get interesting - how to divide the treasure.  A timer is set and there is one minute to mutually agree on who gets what or else it's lost to all involved.Scoring - Dividing the loot and keeping track of what each piece is treasure is where the strategy comes in.  Metallic pieces are set in point value while you need to get the most of clear colored pieces in order to have them be worth something, but if you can get the most of a set of colored pieces it's worth big points. So do you let your opponent get away with a colored piece or do you dispute it or do you accept a number of metallic pieces in trade?Additional Rules - There are advanced rules that concern when wizards or thieves are played and another reason why there are treasure screens included. (Can't see what the other players currently have and can't see what you might be stealing under a certain rule.)  There are also advanced scoring rules and additional magic cards that can be played if wanting to go deeper into the rules and strategy.Ease of Understanding - the game under basic rules is really pretty simple though the mechanics behind scoring can be a little intricate for the younger set.  My 9 and 7 ear olds could understand basic gameplay but scoring was a bit much for the 7yo.Nitpicks:* The gold and silver look way to much alike in most light.* The treasure screens are pretty flimsy.* Would be nice to have a larger variety of dragon designs on the cards.* Gameplay is straightforward but the rules could be laid out in a much simpler fashion and like others have noted, some play examples would go a long way towards clearing up some of the intricacies of the rules.Summary:Fun party game that is a moves right along after you've cleared that first learning hurdle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZABXYOAGEBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R1DZABXYOAGEBY","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great shirt.What it is: A fast drying poly-cotton blend with an anti-microbial treatment.  Basically a gym shirt that is cut to be more of an everyday shirt.  The material is soft, and while it could be softer, I own some other brands that are worse in this regard.  I also find the cut, longer in the torso with a slimming at the waist, flattering on my wife though that is purely personal preference.As for sizing, we received the small, 4-6, which fit her a little on the big side.  My wife is usually an XS but is sometimes an S if the cut runs small, which in this case means I would expect that an XS would fit my wife.

"Unlike other reviewers I was able to get this camera setup with less hassle than they experienced.  Some background on my tech capability and need for this camera.Experience: I'm no networking pro but I have set up multiple routers, a modem, a networked hard drive, and some wired internet solutions.  I do appreciate automated solutions, but I have dug around the menus of a router to tweak settings when necessary.Need: To use an IP camera like this with my iPhone or Android tablet instead of a boxed-solution baby monitor.  Better resolution, all the functionality and cheaper to boot.How this camera performs:Right before I got this camera I also bought a Foscam 9821 so I can directly compare the two cameras.Setup - like I said, I didn't have much trouble getting this camera setup on my Win10 PC though, I wsa viewing the feed not on the PC but on my iPhone.  The Foscam was trickier in that they're software seems incompatible with Win10 though I could get the camera to work with my iPhone.Image quality - Both gave crisp images in 720P* but in a low lit room the Foscam would still output color while the TRENDNet would aggressively switch to black & white wit the infrared LEDs lit up.  (*720 is max resolution though you may want to lower it to get better image lag performance.)Lag - The TRENDNet was insanely lag-y compared to the Foscam.  The Foscam had a fraction of a second delay while the TRENDNet had over a second, close to two seconds.  I can't say whether it was due to the app or the camera but the net effect was that the Foscam was borderline real time while the TRENDNet was not even close.  This lag was also evident and excruciatingly painful when trying to re-position the camera.  The Foscam would move and stop very closely aligned with the inputs coming from the app.  Conversely, the TRENDNet would stutter seconds after the app input was made moving in small chunks.  I often overshot how where I wanted to end as the unit would keep stutter-stepping long after I had finished tapping the direction control.  Also, note that if image settings were driving the laggy results then I don't believe I should've had the pan/tilt response issues I had.Audio - both have two way audio though I had a hard time getting the Foscam to receive audio.Design - Both are white balls on circular pedestals.  The TRENDNet is slightly more compact but neither have that sexy tech look that some products have.Brackets - the TRENDNet comes with a sturdy steel mounting bracket while the Foscam comes with an adjustable plastic bracket.  Like the adjustability of the Foscam bracket but the sturdiness of the steel TRENDNet bracket.Winner - Easily the Foscam due to price, low light performance, and most especially a LOT less lag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CNXT9LG9UOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","R2CNXT9LG9UOK","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is awesome - like the review says ""slot cars without the slots"".  There is really a lot of value here so here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* Slot car racing with the slots.  The AI and the sensor track allows you to navigate the completely by using the throttle only.  No need to steer at all, though if you do you will be able to navigate the course at a faster speed.* Everything included to race but batteries.  Track. 2 cars. 2 remotes.* Track is quite large, easy to set up and can be arranged in multiple configurations.  Really surprised at how fast it was to tear down the track when you were done playing for the day.* RC mode.  Tired of just zipping along a predefined course?  Switch to RC mode and you basically have two RC cars to play with and race, really extends the play value in my opinion.* Remove-able wheels.  About 10 minutes into our very first racing session my son crashes his car into a wall and a wheel flies off.  I thought ""well that goes that"" until he brought over the car and said ""the wheels go back on"" and pop we were back off to the races.  I was pretty relieved to know that the set wasn't trashed within the first 10 minutes of using it.* Plenty of different races modes.  Practice, racing, different skill levels, AI obstacles (oil slicks are a blast)* Wireless.  They're RC cars so of course right, except, they're also slot cars so they have that over most of those sets as well.* Sounds.  The remotes all have programmed race sounds which add to the racing experience.  (Can also be a little loud, so....)* Headphone jack.  For when you need to be a bit quieter.  Screaming at your siblings is unfortunately not covered by headphones.Cons:* We seemed to be going through the AAAs in the cars pretty quick.  I'd recommend rechargeables for this set for that reason.* Batteries not included.  6AA and 6AAA is quite a bit of batteries needed to get going.Aside from what seemed to be a healthy battery appetite this is a really great set.  Tons of variety and the kids and I are having a blast racing each other. And when we're done with that we can bomb around the house chasing each other.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXPT3YZ2AF6IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","RXPT3YZ2AF6IV","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This kind of product has been around for a while, and is the same kind that therapists use to rehabilitate patients after surgery. (I used one after my shoulder surgery.)  The way it works is that it send small electrical impulses through electrodes into the muscle that cause the muscle to spastically contract.  It works well for when motion is tough, like in rehab work.This unit is fine as far as that goes, there are a lot of programs from beginner to advanced, very fine level of tuning between impulse strength, and it remembers what program you had it on last.  My biggest gripe is that you only get one set of gel pads, which aren't cheap (3 cost the about a third what this unit costs) and need to be replaced after a while. Gotta love that razor blade revenue model - sell the razor cheap, charge for the blades.As to the efficacy of the unit, it will help in tightening the mid-section but it won't produce miracles.  For those flat abs pictured on the box you would should really incorporate a full program of healthy eating and exercising which includes traditional core exercises.  If you just want a place to start in tightening that core or using this to supplement what you're already doing, this isn't a bad place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162676IO5O8UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9M76A0#wasThisHelpful","R162676IO5O8UI","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title pretty much says it all, once you get the hang of the rules the game is very easy to play.  It's in creating and executing the strategies and understanding how much can be accomplished in a single round where the strategy really kicks in.The game plays like a very simple game of risk, a sort of cross between Ticket to Ride and Risk where you use cards to ""buy"" bridges between the islands  and once you occupy more than half the bridges to an island you ""own"" that island.  The basic mechanic is quite simple and my 9yo picked it up right away.  But the scoring is done after a complete play through of the cards and there are 3 scoring rounds.  The deck is also quite small (as game card decks go) so you can zip right through a round.  But figuring out where to put those bridges is key as is knowing when to replace an opponents bridge with your own.If I had any kind of gripe is that the game is only for 2 players otherwise, it's nice break from other two player strategy games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HN1DQADEGHBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","R1HN1DQADEGHBT","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Handsome ladies watch with a quiet Japanese movement and mother-of-pearl face. Other details abut the watch:* Real leather backing to the band* Sapphitek crystal face - a synthetic sapphire, should be more durable than a glass face.* Mother-of-pearl fae has a subtle swirl design that radiates outward.* Handsome navy band, (my favorite aspect of this watch).  The material seems to be a tightly woven synthetic.  Not sure how durable it will be to abrasion or wear and tear, but it looks great.* Date indicator above 6 o'clock position* Larger and thicker than most women's watches.  Think mid-sized men's watch, though not as thick as many automatics.* Japanese quartz movement.* Polished stainless steel casing.* Crystals inset on face and bezel.  The bezel crystals are quite small, which may or may not be a plus depending on your preference.Summary, this is a handsome watch, though a tad ""bling-y"" in my humble opinion.

"Here are the pros and cons of the Braven 805 as I see them.Pros:* Attractive and modern design.  The unit is really quite nice in hand* Loud.  The 805 is larger than most portable Bluetooth units and is therefore able to output greater sound volume without distortion* Lots of bass and a decent midrange when using Bluetooth.  Great for music that is heavy in those frequencies.* Charging port.  You can use the internal battery to recharge your USB devices, like a cellphone.* Battery level indicator.  5 LEDs let you know the rough percentage of power left in the battery.* Aux input.  If your source doesn't have Bluetooth you can plug it right into the Braven with the included cable.* Can take calls over the speaker.  Even includes a pickup/hangup button on the top.* Charger includes swap-able international plug-in tips.  Great if you plan on travelling overseas with the unit.* Auto-shut off after 90 minutesCons:* High end frequencies are quite unrefined.  The weakest point in the sound quality of the unit.  Disappointing.* No LED indicators. No lights telling you if the unit is on or if you've made a sync with you BT device.* Charging brick.  Biggest charger I've seen in quite a while.* Sounds worse when plugging in directly.  I'm was actually really surprised to find out that the unit sounds worse when plugging my iPhone in directly.  It seems as the reduced compression from this method allowed the weakness in the articulation in the upper frequencies to really shine through.  I wouldn't recommend this connection method because of it.  Sometimes this is because of overamping the source signal but I tried lowering the volume on the iPhone and upping it on the Braven to see if I could alleviate the high end scratch.  Unfortunately that didn't help.Summary:This is a handsomely designed unit that has decent sound quality over Bluetooth (favoring low and low-mid frequencies) but misses a couple execution niceties like a power LED and a reasonably sized charger.  Maybe at a lower price this would be an easier recommend but at over $200 it's tough unless the goal is to pump out certain kinds of music at high volumes and have the ability to charge your phone at the same time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4903B6QAPJQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1SBB9A#wasThisHelpful","R4903B6QAPJQ5","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beautiful hat but be sure to note the following:* It runs on the large side .  I'm usually a medium/large but in this hat, a small/medium is the size that fit best.* It is a ""high crown"" design.  The height of the at from the brim is a bit bigger than normal, so the hat sits off the foreaed rather than curving around with it.

"This is a great professional quality laser level.  It's accurate, solidly built, powered with regular AA batteries (4) and includes the Bosch modular system hard case.For most of us DIY'ers it's most likely overkill, and additionally with all the options out there important to mathc the tool to the job.  This specific tool includes only a slightly adjustable floor stand, no tripod or wall mount.  Those will be need for like mounting cabinets, or work, or hanging things off the ground - basically anything that requires a horizontal level that isn't with 6 inches of the floor.  In that  case a tripod or a different laser level kit would be needed.  This kit is great for truing a door or framing out a wall.A nice feature in line with the intended use is the ability to lock out the self leveling mechanism.  Self-leveling basically means letting the laser hang and letting gravity make sure the lines are level.  Works great but if you bang it around, the accuracy can be impacted.  When turned off the unit locks out the ability of the lasers to swing freely, thereby giving it some protection from rough handling.  I wouldn't toss this around but it definitely makes the unit sturdier than units without the lockout.Additionally, you can use the in self leveling and locked positions.  The locked out position is perfect if you need to set a line the is intentionally out of level but needs to be straight.On the note of accessories, the case that this level comes with is half full and contains an insert that is meant to be filled out with those accessories.In summary, I'm very happy with this kit but for those considering it, be aware of what your uses will be, whether this is right tool and whether or not the jobsite-level durability is worth paying for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVGH5TTJMYWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7DRPHW#wasThisHelpful","RSVGH5TTJMYWZ","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money, I am blown away at the quality of this set-up.As someone who hasn't ridden in a long time (outside of firing up the board I owned as a teen last year), and who was a huge Powell-Peralta fan back in the day, I am extremely satisfied with this board.The wheels spin very freely, the deck has a great shape, the tape was well applied and the wheels and trucks (mini-logo) are really nice.  Sure, the deck was made in china but you can see the plywood layers and I suspect the entire rig will hold up well just like others have mentioned.Summary:Whether you're just starting, an old pro getting back into it, or an experienced rider looking for a bash-around deck, this should easily suit your needs.Of note:* Depending on you height/weight/shoe size this may or may not be the size of deck you need, or the shape want.  PP makes complete skateboards of different dimensions so there should be one that fits your specific needs.  This deck is geared to riders of average height, weight and shoe size and are looking to skate street/park.  I'm 6ft with a 9.5 shoe and this fits me great - though a slightly wider deck would also have worked.* I had to back off a couple of the axle nuts a quarter turn or so to free up the bearings just a bit.

It arrived sharp; sharp enough to easily cut through a ripe tomato, and in a very nice box (though quite a bit oversized).About the knife:* Nice weight and balance in hand.* Sharp.

With proper care should be as durable as any Henckels or Wusthof knife.* High end look.  The 3 rivets with the larger center rivet and it's stamped logo all give the knife a quality feel.* Handle.  Has wood graining, but I don't believe it's real wood.  Most likely a composite resin, which is still very handsome in hand.About the box:* Admittedly not the most important part of the knife but in case this should be a gift, the knife comes in a very handsome charcoal gray box with magnetic latches.

"This is a phenomenal kit that makes the awesomeness of custom made pedal cables accessible to anyone.The is a reason why custom made cables are preferred for a pedal board.  Depending on your pedals and layout the perfect amount of cable between pedals and the orientation of the jack is rarely the same.  this kit gives you the flexibility to achieve that perfect layout without having to go to all the work of buying the cable and jacks and then stripping and soldering the connections.  It additionally gives you all the tools you need to get the project complete including the wire cutter and screwdriver needed.Some thoughts on the kit itself.* Wire cutter.  Worked surprisingly well.  Built like a cigar clipper the cut that I get out of it was a LOT cleaner than the one I got from using my wire snips, something I totally did not expect.  Awesome.* Screwdriver.  The weakest part of the kit as it is pretty cheap and a bit undersized for the screw heads.  No biggie as I have a ton of screwdrivers around the house and another fit perfectly.* Cable.  On par with other cables I've gotten in the Planet Waves line.* Jacks.  Very solid and obviously all L-shaped.* Adjustable.  After putting together my first cable realized I had the orientation of the jacks misaligned.  Loosen the screw rotate and retighten and everything was ready to go.Durability.  Well a pedal board isn't generally something that is torn down after every gig but the should last as long as you aren't constantly pulling on the cable.Other thoughts:  I hope that Planet Waves releases some straight jacks as some of my pedals would be better off with those over L-shaped jacks.Summary:I can't recommend this kit enough if you are interested in looking at an easy way to clean up you board with custom cables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGEZN4EZWH8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BW2D84#wasThisHelpful","RYGEZN4EZWH8P","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really nice looking pan with a great heft to it but unfortunately I didn't find it to measure up to the visual appeal.  Here are the pros and cons of this pan as I see them:Pros:* Beautiful looking pan.  The blue enamel looks great and the cast and polished aluminum handle are really handsome and give the pan a high end look.* Heft and weighty construction.  Well it is cast iron so the pan will be heavy but the solid handle, stainless steel - mostly likely clad aluminum, and large rivets give it that extra bit of high end build quality feel.* All the pros of cast iron cooking.  All the performance you'd expect from using a heavy gauge cast iron pan.Cons:* My pan was warped.  Place the pan on the granite countertop or the cooktop and it was easy to see the pan was warped as it wobbled when touched it.* Cast iron surface is coarser than other cast Iron I own.  We've been using cast iron for a while so this isn't our first pan and part of properly using a cast iron pan is seasoning it.  When I went to season this pan, by slowly heating it up and then working some high flash point oil into it (I used safflower oil) the pan kept shredding the paper towel.  I couldn't work the oil without leaving bits of paper stuck to the side of the pan, which was quite frustrating.  I don't have this problem any of our Lodge pans and I not to keen on having bits of Brawny in my food.* No lid.  I can understand not including a lid with a griddle but this is so close to being a large fry pan that not having it seems like an omission.  I suppose this is why they make spatter guards but still, it would have been great to have a lid included.In summary, this is a beautiful pan, designed in Ireland but let down by it's Chinese manufacturing.

"This is a excellent hair roller with only a couple caveats.  Here are the pros and cons of this curling iron.Pros:* Heats up very fast.  The box says 30 seconds but my wife while not paying attention to the clock simply said, ""this heated up really fast"".* Forward, back, and reset buttons.  It was really nice to hit the reset button and have the roller return to the start position.* Solid build quality.  This just feels like a quality product.  From the higher gauge (thicker) power cord to the included velcro strap to keep it bundled up cleanly, to the ceramic barrel, and ergonomic feel of the handle.* Digital temp set with LED display and power button.  Very simple to use.  Default temp was 360 F* 410 F top end temp.* Very comfortable in hand, though the solid build and internal gearing does add to the weight.Cons:* Gets quite warm up near where the barrel meets the handle.  Unfortunately you need to rest your hand up in that area when using the barrel clip thumb button.  You move your hand down the handle to comfortably use the left and right (forward and back?) buttons but when placing hair into the clip you do need to get your hands up near that area.  This is due to the fact that the barrel clip button is so short because it has to move with the barrel as it rotates.* Barrel clip is very short.  No flips here as you can only get so much hair in the clip at one time.  This is really the achilles heal of the product or rather the thing that makes it more a specialist tool and less of a does all kinds of curls tool.Summary:This is a very good curling iron, well built and thoughtfully laid out.  Still, it's important to remember that depending on how you like to do your hair this might not be the last curling iron you buy but rather the one you go to for easily putting together a specific look.  Beyond that our biggest gripe was that it gets pretty warm around the spot you need to hold when putting your hair into the barrel clip.So if the specific look you're going for is smaller curls on roughly uniform length hair, then this is an iron you should definitely consider.  If you need more of a jack of all trades iron, it might make more sense to consider or rollers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359T63NC9QBQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV49UFI#wasThisHelpful","R359T63NC9QBQI","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who very much dislikes feeling like they have put lotion/moisturizer on, this is the perfect moisturizer for me.  This is also very different from how my wife feels about lotion.  She's someone who uses lotion religiously out of the shower, while I'm much more of a ""needs based"" kind of guy.That said, when I do need some lotion I tend to go for Aveeno as that is the best lotion I've found that cures my chapped hands in the winter while being about as free of that ""wearing lotion"" feeling as I can get.  Luckily, Aveeno is my wife's go-to lotion so whenever I need some, it's right there for me to use.Which brings us to how does this lotion/moisturizer compare to regular Aveeno and consequently to the admittedly odd title of this review.  I liken the difference between the two lotions as the difference between whole milk and 2% milk.  One is much richer than the other but both are great for the purpose that you want to use them.  Some like drinking only whole milk, while others prefer 2% (or even 1% or fat free) for drinking.  Tht richness of whole milk is too much for them to take when drinking it but it might be the better option for putting in your coffee or using in a mixed drink.That's roughly how these two lotions compare.  Sheer hydration is a lighter formulation that indeed feels even less like you're wearing lotion than the already very good regular Aveeno.  Now that lighter feel might be too light for some, my wife included, but for me it was perfect as a daily moisturizer.  Comparing the two directly, I much preferred the light lotion-free feel of the Sheer Hydration formula for a go-to daily moisturizer.  But on one of those cold dry winter days, I'll still be going for the regular Aveeno because I'll need the richer more hydrating regular formulation.  Just like how I prefer cream or whole milk for my coffee.In summary, this is a great lotion that can both compliment or replace regular Aveeno for those that prefer a very light moisturizer while those that really prefer a richer formulation are most likely better off sticking with regular Aveeno. Now will that be cream or milk in your coffee?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTH55SIJ0O12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFR14ZU#wasThisHelpful","RVTH55SIJ0O12","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, this filter was compatible with my Tassimo and I couldn't notice any particular difference in performance.  Neither filter left black sediment in the bottom of the water reservoir and the flavor of my coffee wasn't impacted for the worse (or better).Would I recommend this filter? Considering that the Mavea brand filters are $5-$6 while this is $8, doesn't work with Mavea pitcher replacement meter, and doesn't have a recycling program it really is hard to recommend it over the original considering performance appeared similar.Notes about the app:The filter app is purely based on time, yet the filter is rated at gallons OR time. It has no way of knowing how many gallons you've used so it simply says ""time's up"".  Ok, if you're only worried about letting too much time expire between changes.  Additionally, the app will let you know where to buy more filters, if you live in the UK.  The rest of us get a list of distributors.  Oh, but they've been generous enough to make the app ad free, so says the app description.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZOIAGV67V1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9WLH4O#wasThisHelpful","R31ZOIAGV67V1","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent monitor.  Color reproduction is excellent and comes factory adjusted with the compliance sheet showing it's been done.  I love reviewing my DSLR pictures with this monitor as they just pop, as well as highlighting any mistake in focus that I didn't see on my laptop monitor.Viewing angle.  The viewing angle of the monitor is so much better than that of my laptop.  Last night my wife and I were comparing winter hats on both monitors.

We had no such issue with this Dell.About build, design, connections.This is your typical Dell monitor.  Average bezel, spring loaded easy to assemble stand, 90 degree rotation, front and back tilt, and multiple ports including USB 3.0, HDMI, and Display Port (in and out for daisy chaining), and speaker line out .

Specs are: Grey-to-Grey. 8 ms (typical), 6 ms (fast) according to Dell.In the end, specs are just specs.  All I know is that the pictures I took with my Canon never looked better.

"This is a very nice watch, one which my daughter is constantly trying to steal away from my wife.Notes about construction and design.  The band is real leather and the clasps and casing are real stainless steel.  The face is mother of pearl (or imitation mother of pearl) and looks quite nice with against the rose-gold band and case.  The overall design is simple but elegant.If I had any quibbles it would be that the foil finish on the band seems quite delicate - be careful not to scratch it.  Also, the watch does feel a little light.  The mineral crystal face should prevent scratches on the face which is a nice benefit.Finally, depending on the monitor you are using the watch might be a tad rosier than it appears in photos, i.e. a touch pinker and less straight gold in tone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JT0C8Y3IVOOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1HIMQW#wasThisHelpful","R3JT0C8Y3IVOOW","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are the pros and cons as I see them with this product:Pros:*Taste - Has a real strawberry smoothie taste - somewhat similar to Yoplait Strawberry banana yogurt.  If you generally like strawberry/strawberry banana smoothies you'll most likely like this flavor.*No artificial sweetener aftertaste.* Mix-ability - I'd rate the ease of mixing of the powder in the 3.5 to 4 out of 5 range.  Better than average but not best in class for being able to mix in milk with just a spoon or other utensil.* Compact - a smaller-than-average scoop delivers as much protein as most larger scoops.Cons:* Very noticeable fiber.  I am definitely not a fan of fiber drink products and the added fiber in this mix gives it a very Metamucil like consistency and in-mouth feel.Debatable:* Soy protein: Could be a pro, could be a con depending on your preferences* Bag size.  I received 4 small bags in this order.  Considering the size of protein jars and bags that I usually get a single bag of this powder is much smaller than the usual.  This almost definitely has something to do with the smaller portion sizes, but still I was taken aback at the actual size of the bag.  0.6lbs says it all right here.Summary:This is great tasting, in my opinion, protein mx that is brought down slightly by the very noticeable fiber content.  If you're a fan of strawberry smoothies and don't mind fiber in your protein mixes then this is a great product for you.  Also if you enjoy smoothies and are looking for a non-dairy protein mix - though I assume you wouldn't be mixing it with milk.Side note: my package arrive with one of the 4 bags burst and powder all over the inside of the box.  I'm sure Amazon would take care of this for regular orders but something to note all the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6ZJ1WPG2LHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTNQ6OS#wasThisHelpful","R3B6ZJ1WPG2LHO","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are the pros and cons of this machine as I and my experienced sowing-machine user mother-in-law see them.Pros:* Directions:  The were well documented on paper (included), online, as well as on the machine.  Made starting to use the machine easier to do.* Sample designs.  Lots of built in sample designs to choose from (over 50 on paper, 2800 on the USB stick).* Ability to incorporate new designs.  Memory stick included to ease in transferring designs from computer to machine.* Software to help making your own designs.* Set up.  Sewing machine layout and physical design is similar to a traditional sewing machine making navigating the machine more familiar.* Start/stop button.  No clutter from a foot pedal (though a foot pedal wouldn't really make sense here.)* Compact design: Takes up roughly the same amount of space a traditional sewing machine would.* Ease of use.  After figuring out how to use the machine, producing embroidery was pretty straight forward.Cons:* Single color at a time.  You need to load each color onto the spool one at a time as they are needed for the design.  THis means you can't program your multi-color design, hit the start button and come back to a completed piece like you would at those mall kiosks.* If you don't use the correct thread or backing, you run the risk of getting excess thread excess loops.  Basically shortcuts could cost you in the quality of the finished piece.Debatable:* Machine aesthetic.  A personal question as to whether you like the white and gold design of the machine.* Uses a ton of thread, but really what do we expect for an embroidery machine.* Learning curve.  While learning the machine is easy to do with well documented instructions that are easily accessible in multiple formats, it does take a while.  It took as about an hour to study the instructions.In summary, this is a great home embroidery machine that loses a point because of the need to switch colors as needed and for the slightly finicky nature of needing to use the right materials or risk excess thread loops and slightly misaligned outlines.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4B9AJRBZLEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9NMMBO#wasThisHelpful","R2J4B9AJRBZLEB","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here are the pros and cons of these towels as I see them.Pros:*Soft after washing.  The marketing text says these towels will stay soft after many times through the wash.  So far so good and while they arrived not overly soft/plush, they were much better after that first wash.*Absorbent.*Size.  These aren't huge towels but they aren't on the small cheap side.  The size felt just right for a guy that's 6ft.Cons:*Don't seem to dry any better than my regular cotton towels.Debatable:*Color.  I think the color is very handsome and goes really well with my bathroom deco, but this is obviously personal taste.  the color is rich but a bit more on the olive-y side than the picture shows.*Material.  These towels feature a cotton/modal mix.  The towels are soft but do have a bit of a rayon or synthetic silk feel to them.  This is what gives the towel the soft feel but is different than brand new ultra plush cotton.

"This is a pretty straightforward product.  Place the cap in the open bottle, put the pump on top and pump like you're blowing up a bike tire.  The problem is that the pump just slides over the cap without a latch or hook to keep it attached or locked in while pumping.So while this works as advertised, I felt I needed quite a bit of pressure to keep the seal when pumping.  Maybe I was using too much force but I could see how someone would get quite fatigued using this product.  Additionally, it was much easier to get a level of vacuum in a fuller bottle than an emptier bottle.On the plus side, it looks great which won't look out of place on a well appointed wine bar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKXMRBNNAL0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTWA3HQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UKXMRBNNAL0O","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are the pros and cons of this bar.Pros:*No artificial sweeteners.  Which means no chemical aftertaste.*Not too sweet.  Not bland but just sweet enough in my humble opinion.*20 grams of protein with only 6grams of fat.  This is a nice medium size bar, not a full meal replacement bar like a Big 100. It has a nice amount of protein for it's size - many other medium or snack sized bars are only 15 grams -  but also not at the cost of extra calories (only 210 here) or fat.  Some bars get up into the 8 to 10 range for a 20g protein equivalent.*12 grams of fiber which is not noticeable.  Unlike drink mixes that include fiber and have a very thick and almost pulp-y feel in mouth, the fiber in this bar isn't really noticeable.* Banana flavor.  Banana flavor comes in two distinct varieties: fake banana that comes in candy, like Laffy Taffy, and real fruit banana.  This bar is more real fruit than fake candy banana.Cons:* Dry and chewy.  That lack of fat comes at a price.  The bars I had were dry and somewhat chewy, which in my opinion were the worst things about this bar.Debatable:* Peanut butter and banana flavor.  The bar really does taste like a peanut butter and banana sandwich, which is a flavor I personally like. Admittedly isn't for everyone so your mileage will obviously vary on how much you like that flavor.* Not coated.  The picture is somewhat deceiving in that it looks like the bar is possibly coated in a yogurt-flavor coating.  It isn't.  Additionally, it looks like the inner bar has an almost granola bar consistency.  It doesn't, it's much more like a non-oatmeal cookie dough.  Very consistent throughout.In summary, the best way to describe this bar is to compare it to another Met-Rx product - the Big 100 Cookie Dough Bar - but smaller, without the chips, less sweet, somewhat drier/cheriwer, and banana peanut-butter flavored.  This for me is an almost perfect downsizing of what is one of my favorite bars.  If only the bar was a tad moister it'd be perfect in my humble opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23B7VV8PWHERW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6X0LM#wasThisHelpful","R23B7VV8PWHERW","A2MVPY9XVYST9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVPY9XVYST9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed it. I guess I'm left a bit bitter over the ending though. I think another thirty pages could have made this book go from good to great. This has the typical aw shucks hero tale flavor that Alan Black is a master of and we all like. It's a good book, just not as good as the first one. By the points:-The end could have been a lot better and more complete. It left a lot in the air and came on suddenly. Not quite a cliffhanger but let's just say a sequel is mandatory.-Definitely a ""ground pounder"" tale, not a spacer tale (for better or worse)-Like all Alan Black, the characters are a bit goody-goody and circumstances are a bit too handy-Main character wastes less and less time on self doubt-Started good exploration into several alien species-Like what happened to the main character's evolution, both figuratively and literally-A lot of things were nicely positioned for a strong sequel-Kind of got tired of the random scenes where the one barely dressed hottie dropped in to shoot/stab something or reveal some handy info all while we had to receive gratuitous commentary on her butt, nipples, or outline. I'm not a prude - it just became a bit repetitive.-Would have liked to have had more insight into the main villain race's viewpoint / motivationsThis is #2 in the series, so if you haven't read the first do that first.

"Kyle Riggs' stories had been a lot better than Cody Riggs' adventures until now. This is the best Star Force book I've read in a long time and finally made Cody shine. They are all good but this one was really good.-Cody matures into his own legacy and accomplishments escaping his father's shadow-Tons of plot threads are wrapped up, so many I had even forgotten about some-The number and diversity of races involved is excellent, and we now have several as crew-All the pagetime dedicated to Marvin. I won't give anything away other than to say there's a rich and surprising story there-This book wrapped up the Cody Riggs trilogy: The end was a complete end with no cliffhangers whatsoever-There were some heart tugging moments of humanity from things like brainboxes-Strong dialog with the ancient race. Like how Cody handled that.-The Cody relationship scenes were handled better than usual-A gratuitous bit of nostalgia at the end that brings things full circle nicelyThere weren't any major bad point in this book either. So again a highpoint in the series. I'm sure there will be more and I'm glad for it.

"This is a bit of an odd series in how the author is able to tell the story. I've really enjoyed the earlier books. However - I think this one suffers significantly based on the following points:X  Too many characters - Without re-reading the previous books you get lost in the cast of hundreds and forget who's whoX  Story elements were disappointing - The big plots were pretty vanilla. This is upside down from what we've come to expect. Take the first book where a nobody ambassador goes on crazy dates and amazing things happen! Here it's the reverse - A whole armada of ships visit the station and pretty much squat happens except a bunch of mooching and dancing. The new show, the adopted girl, the wanderers, a new race... so many opportunities that turned out to be dudsX  The world/situation/characters are the same at the end - We learn a bit more about the Stryx but that's about it. It was all a bunch of nothing at the end of the day.X  This was a hard book to pick up - It's important to remember the specific attributes of all the races, what made each of the humans unique, etcetera... and the last book having been so long ago you forget all of it with few recaps or remindersX  This book was a hard book to finish - I found myself able to set it down easily. Not a compelling page turner. I kept waiting for those subtle conversations with a Stryx that flip the whole world upside down or a crisis the humans turn around into a miracle or some other typical fare of the series.Bottom line it seemed like we were just going through the motions to cash in on another book. I'll give the series one more chance because I've loved the first books, but if the next iteration in October (""Vacation on Union Station"") isn't any better I will be permanently abandoning the series in disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q4BRJAU2NXIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VITFIY0#wasThisHelpful","R1Q4BRJAU2NXIH","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was, appropriately, about rebuilding after the big battle in the previous book. Rebuilds are normally boring, but the author did a great job on this one and found several ways to keep the action up. By the points:X  The scene where The Admiral deals with his Tractoan problem made the book. That one scene alone. The rest is just gravy.X  Major focuses: Rear admiral Janeski/imperials, Nikomedes, org growing pains, family issues, reputation/role of the MSPX  Don’t like how Nikomedes storyline was left, nor how it played out with AkanthaX  Like how the old Middleton crew rec’d a nice setup for another fun side adventureX  Would have liked more than a tease over the clover heartX  C’mon with the clover timeline alreadyX  Thought the babies would be a bigger dealX  More info on MEN / MANX A quick readThe end was where it had to be and not bad considering.I'm giving this the full 5 stars for the Tractoan scene. The overall book was a 4, but that scene and its dialog is one of a few I've read over the years that will stick in my mind long after I've forgotten everything else about this series.

"I give credit to the main concept. Of the 100's of stories I've read this setting seems pretty unique and interesting. On that basis alone I read the book and feel I got my money's worth.The author does a solid job of exploring this meat world given the short few pages he has to tell the tale, but I take a full 2 stars off because:1) There really isn't an end. The story runs out in an odd place that I would say doesn't even qualify as a cliffhanger. It would be a poor place to start for a sequel.2) I also felt that the events which occurred at the end were rather wasted/pointless as nothing was achieved and a day of storyline was thrown away on travel at a time when every moment counted.3) The disparity in the surface people's level of education/tech seems a bit absurd. The time spent on the creature wasn't that great, but you've got people using computers in one place and the equivalent of 18th century country bumpkins in anotherSo, I'd say read this anyway. Especially if he expands with a subsequent story. Just go in expecting an appetizer... not a meal.Also - At the end of the book the author explains how he came up with the concept for this book. I found it a very interesting twist of perspective.

"The first book was a little weak but had some interesting concepts and the powerful human reaver units to read about (3-stars-ish). Here comes the sequel. I thought the author and the tale would get better with experience. Well... neither did.By the points:1) The end sucks. It's a cliffhanger, but that's irrelevant. It basically announces ""hey we're officially jumping the shark - stay tuned!""2) Too many pages of fluff and internal character thoughts. Repeatedly took many pages on what should have been edited down to a paragraph or two3) Regarding editing, it's clearly not professionally edited but it isn't too bad either.4) Humans are super-uper-duper powered and nothing touches them. No challenge. No fun. No suspense. Even tough bad guys have to go 3-on-1 or more to stand a chance.5) No new elements of strategy, ability, or what-not.6) Not a page turner. I put this book down and walked away from it 3 times only coming back in hopes of an interesting finish. Even the action scenes weren't engrossing.7) Main characters are very dry and two-dimensionalMany more books are planned in this series. I will not be buying any more of them. There are bad books in every series, but this one is so bad, and so clearly sets the storyline in a silly direction, that I have no interest in continuing.I hate writing reviews like this, but it's that bad. I have trouble citing anything this bad that I've read recently, even the cheap/free indie stuff I take a chance on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P85QDVK11FX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMO2P84#wasThisHelpful","R1P85QDVK11FX8","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is as good or better than the previous books, and very long to boot. The end is a bit of a cliffhanger, and leaves things in an interesting place, but the ride had to stop somewhere.By the points:-Learn more about the soft krall-Learn more about the olt ships-Scale/stakes get elevated-Interesting new combat/tactics/abilities introduced-Hub world/Kobani human cooperation and conflicts explored-Continued growth/exploration of the 3 slave races-Continued human tricks, but Krall learn fast-Some wins and some losses, not just a one-sided beat ‘em upI think there’s probably one book left in the main storyline, with maybe an offshoot story or two that gives backstory on a major Prada, Torki, or other some such character. After that the Krall are done. Not a lot of fight left to hash out. Author has given us some good hints that there’s a bigger story to explore though after we get done whupping the Krall.FYI – Saw a complaint about the $6.99 price. C’mon! This has turned into a consistently great story. There were some editing issues but very few and much cleaner than most. The story is also 2 or 3 times as big as the cheaper indie stuff. You get what you pay for. The indie stuff is occasionally great too, but this is a big pile of top-notch win. Be glad you no longer live in the bookstore era and aren’t stuck with a $25 first release hardback price to squeeze every drop of revenue out of your pocket like the old days.Regardless, if you’ve read the first 3 there’s no stopping you at this point. Just prepare for 2 or 3 sleepless nights instead of one because it’s a whopper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL1ODJ16UCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI7993Y#wasThisHelpful","RKL1ODJ16UCZ","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a small bit of romance, but this really isn't a romance tale. The dates were just a framework rolling out a nice story. It's a fun read with some nice unique elements in it.I put off reading it until there wasn't anything else because of the reviews calling it a romance. When I saw there was a whole series set up after this, I took a chance and I don't regret it. I even pre-ordered the last one Spy Night.The stories are short, but the characters are good and the events / circumstances keep the book rolling along with suspense, mystery or other interesting things.

"Like others have noted, this is just as good as the first Hard Luck Hank. The series is great, and even better is the fact that there's really nothing like it. Only book I can think of that actually made me laugh out loud at several points. Gritty parts, sad parts, a really nice emotional buffet. The author has a talent for making the mundane seem special and conversely the special seem mundane.I'll only leave this one review, but all the books were great. No cliffhangers either. Even the early years / Delavoa short stories were solid. If you like HLH #1 I dare say you'll like the other books even better. The author keeps the core characters and adds other interesting ones, the events are fresh but always uniquely Hank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31T696LRI68YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU9JRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R31T696LRI68YD","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't care what the author's political views are, and don't even necessarily disagree with some points... but I didn't want a treatise on his philosophy. I wanted a sci-fi book.Normally I give a detailed review, but I can't here. The book was just reheated fluff and ranting.As others have noted, 30-40% of the book is political detour and commentary. The whole story is a retread. Nuttall writes some good stuff, but this isn't it.Characters - Weak and naveCombat - The best part of the book, but it's only really at the summary levelHad the chance to do some neat exploration and relationships with the other races, instead just took a boring obvious path.A lot of time just wasted extrapolating silly decay scenarios on earth due to racial over-sensitivity, anti-union, and pandering politicians.A lot of time wasted on taking two characters through boot that don't really do anything amazing.

"So there are ""animen"" that are part animal / part man. They are second class citizens. Rhinos, wolves, leopards, eagles, possums, you name it. This is set in a universe where megacorps run the show and you want to reach ""buyout"" where you've paid off all your debts incurred from childhood which makes you a free man/beast/whatever.My biggest complaint is the writing. It just isn't very good. 2/3 of the book is everyone having sex with one another. That is literally true... no exaggeration. Mad? Have sex with them. New to the ship? Have sex with them. Save their life? Have sex with them. Just had sex with them? Have sex with them again. Leopard on leopard. Leopard on human woman. Leopard on pretty much anything and everything. Sex. I'm definitely not a prude, but it's like a 12-year-old wrote a harem novel. The scenes aren't even steamy or relevant to anything else going on.My next biggest complaint are the characters. They are all Gomer Pyle level naïve. Nobody gets developed but the main character.Beyond that it isn't too bad. The writing has really bad editing, but you should have seen that coming just by looking at the awful cover that looks like it was created with MS Paint. A lot of pages were spent trying to make a big deal of how the leopard became a pilot and how that made him different only to have him throw it all away for the life of a ground soldier the last third of the book. Stereotypes like weasel men acting like weasels, sand worlds being middle-east-like rich slave nations. Just nags like that which a good editor could have tightened up.What was good and earned three stars (rounding up) from me was the combat scenes. The conflict was along simplistic philosophical views which was rather weak, but the writing covering the action was the best of the book.This story had a lot of interesting tidbits which could have been explored, they just weren't. The author obviously is able to lay down a solid concept. I might check back on him in three or four years once he refines the execution side of things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q6FUWLRVFW64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TSP1LW#wasThisHelpful","R3Q6FUWLRVFW64","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, despite the title, you're actually buying books 4, 5, and 6 in the Conrad series: ""The Flying Warlord"", ""Lord Conrad's Lady"", and ""Conrad's Quest for Rubber"".1) Buy and read the first 3 books in the series first, they really are a must. They are also available in another omnibus: ""Conrad Stargard: The Radiant Warrior (Conrad Stargard Series combo volumes Book 1)""2) If you liked the first 3, you'll like these 3.3) With the last book it starts getting weak and sloppy, and Conrad isn't even the main character4) Do not read Conrad's time machine until you've read everything else. I would not recommend reading that one at all actually because it was terrible and again doesn't have Conrad as a main character.5) Stop here. Don't bother with the further books 7 and 8 (only sold individually) as the storyline jumps the shark at that point and isn't really consistent in style and character with previous books (note the additional authors in the credits of future books as further proof)This is a ""fun"" read. Four stars for fun, not really quality or originalism.

"This book was disjointed and unexciting until chapter 7, about 30% through. Then it's night & day change... becomes a fun read. If you buy, gut it out till you get there and you won't regret it.Things to know:-Stereotypes - Every. Single. Character. If you've read a lot of space stories none of this will be new to you.-This is not really a pirate tale (nor does it have anything meaningful to do with trading either)-This really isn't a robin hood / prosperity story, money is barely a background motive and plays little emphasis in the overall story-The main character (Webber) could have been a lot better/unique/mysterious and rec'd more pages-Space combat is basically ""both ships shoot all your missles, see how many get through""-I guess a lot of people come into this excited from the prior series in the same universe, I did not so take that for what it's worth-The end is very weak an unsatisfying (The synopsis ends right where the story ends)-Lots of opportunities aren't taken (derelict ships aren't salvaged/towed, weapon systems aren't improved, etc.)-The secrets revealed turn out to be boring (why/who's house is Webber paying on?, what's Webber's background?, the secret tech? all really disappointing when revealed)So the first part would get zero stars, the rest would get 3 stars.

"So we're now on our second story with Cody Riggs (Kyle's son). The plethora of aliens continues to expand, a big plus, but the story isn't as exciting as it was in the first 10 books under Kyle.When just B. V. Larson wrote and Mark Boyett narrated the earlier stories, it was a consistent action-packed roller coaster with a clear struggle/goal they strove for in each book. I wonder if the slump this time is because another author is a major contributor in this book as Larson is still writing consistently excellent stuff in his other series.By the points:-They are trapped/cut off from earth, but that struggle of getting home is background noise at best and I felt it should be more of the focus-Sokolov and his temptress sidekick were a waste of pages that really just enabled better intro of ""the new blues"" / big bad guys-I like what was done with the raptors-The new communicator was interesting-Cody character is a mere shadow of Kyle Riggs, and his girlfriend is 2D window dressing-This was a big chance for Marvin to shine, I don't feel that he did (I'm a Marvin fan)-The end was a good tease-I like the hints at connection to past & future story arcs (e.g. Cody's first girl getting killed)-Macro cameos kind of left me feeling burned out, they're just not exciting anymore-Machismo couple interactions / love scenes were even more awful than usual. Take them out or have them add to the story. Build a real relationship/bond that's tested, make them erotic, anything, just give them a purpose and some semblance of reality.I'll read the next one in the series and give time for the authors to develop Cody and give readers greater investment, but only because this is part of a great series and Larson is a consistently good author. If this had been book one of a series by a new author I would probably have tossed it and put that author's name on my do-not-read-anymore list. It wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't that good. I wasn't compelled to turn the next page and stay up till 2AM reading it. Only the teases and hints that were leveraged from the series kept me going until the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIJVGUANHGEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRI5WSC#wasThisHelpful","R1EIJVGUANHGEX","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ignore the ""Age Level"" and ""Grade Level"" info in the book description. (I was almost put off thinking this was a simple young adult story.)It's a trader / first-contact tale. It can get light on details. The main character being fantastically rich oversimplifies a lot of sticky issues. The race contact and trading without language stuff has been done before in other books pretty much identically to this. However, the key is it's woven together very well with good characters and a (very) fast pace. If you like trader tales you'll like this one. Reminds me a lot of Cherryh's books.Like the book before it, the end is similarly abrupt. The spelling/grammar/name mix-up is there too. Only one time was it bad enough to jar me from the story though and this is on par with books of similar caliber. If you liked book 1, this is more of the same but in my opinion bigger and better than the first story. It's going to be at least a trilogy though, and likely 5 or 6 books. I went ahead and read though as this author seems to be publishing new books at a good rate.Don't take my review as negative, the author did a great job continuing a very fun series. Basically, he took the best pieces of several excellent stories from others and wove them into a compelling single tale that keeps providing answers as well as new mysteries, growth, combat, economics, politics, the whole cabbage. The pace necessitates that many details get glossed over, but I'm ok with that in return for never having to read a boring viewpoint or slow buildup.Looking forward to the next one in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OMAHS48QODPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYA9WTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OMAHS48QODPE","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought for someone interested in comfort where they are worn in heat/cold while performing hand-labor. Been through a lot of lanyards. Most would chafe when sweating for hours or had super-cheap hardware that broke resulting in a lost (and very costly) badge. The lanyard material is comfortable and holds up to wear. It's a no-frills construction, but still holds up to heavy wear and tear. Length seems ideal (doesn't hang too long). Only reason I would say not to buy might be if your work has a safety requirement for break-away lanyards that separate if caught in machinery (these don't have that feature obviously).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298O2Z3IN80PU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EVK0XU#wasThisHelpful","R298O2Z3IN80PU","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are hands-down the best crates for quality, style, and (almost) price. Buy them now.If you need a little more convincing...Be careful of the cheaper Sterilite file crates that don't have the circle-shaped side cutouts. This version (16939006) is the best of all crates on the market and on the lower end of price spectrum as well. You can stack these top-to-bottom, as well as side-to-side (e.g. create a bookshelf). MOST OTHERS WON'T stack side-to-side. Each way you can stack it has tabs or grooves to lock into position (versus cheaper ones that don't lock into place on side-to-side configurations).Another reviewer complained about the price of these crates. I can understand, but they were spoiled due to getting an awesome deal. These nicer ones go for about $7 + tax at a certain superstore retailer, so Amazon is 5 bucks high right now ($50 for 6 instead of about $45 after tax in a store). Amazon apparently does do (or has had) sales where they went down into the $30-dollar range on these nicer ones. However, it's worth the extra 5 bucks for me not to wait in line and haul these monsters home (they rarely have this many in stock anyway). Just bite the bullet and get the good ones here & now, you won't regret it. They are worth it at this price ($50).Ideal uses:-File folders (can easily replace an expensive file cabinet and is better because you can haul a single crate anywhere and sort through it)-Bookshelves (put them on their side and stack them to fit your space)-Raw papers (I store reams of legal docs too large to put in individual file folders with a fancy colored-sheet to separate and they fit great)-Kid-stuff organizersThese are sturdy and handle being filled to the brim with paper. I have some as old as 5 years that are still like new and take heavy use.Once you've used a file crate, whether this model or not, you'll never go back. The modular aspect is a game-changer:1) You can take just what you need into your living room or put it into your car.2) Each crate can keep a different category of stuff (vs. just 3 or 4 drawers to choose from in a file cabinet)3) You can keep the most frequently used crates on top / near at hand4) You can stack/configure the crates to suit your space/whim (vs. a gigantic file cabinet - these can be put in tight cubby holes, under desks, in closets)5) You can grow your storage as you need it (I add crates to my ""bookshelf"", my legal cases, every new year of taxes, etc)6) You can use them for random needs in a pinch and haul it somewhere (the circles are small enough to keep most things inside, great for game system cables and discs, dvds, etc.)7) Dirt. Cheap.8) Lasts. Even the best quality boxes fail after moderate handling or age. Heaven help you if one gets wet. These babies are tuff.9) Even full they are manageable (think hauling around a huge heavy box / plastic tote full of paper vs. this smaller crate)The only reasons I can think of not to buy these at Amazon would be 1) color preference or 2) a requirement for sealed containment. They do come in variations such as purple in stores.Welcome to a better way of living. If you buy these, they will be the first of many. They are the kind of thing that is so useful you give them to friends as gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZAAT7FA5Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BDTEWE#wasThisHelpful","R7ZAAT7FA5Z3","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a better choice.This model is flimsier and doesn't lock in when stacked side-to-side (e.g. when using them to create a bookshelf). If you just need crates that will hold file folders and stack+lock top-to-bottom, these are fine, but there is a nicer / more-expensive version that will ALSO stack+lock end-to-end. Search on here for ""Sterilite 16939006 File Crate"" and you'll see it.The main way to tell the difference is the sides. The sturdier all-way-locking has circles cut out of the side, little half-rectangles at each corner that look like feed scoops (these are what lock in on the sides, opposing corners are slightly smaller/larger to fit into each other), and a little more plastic. This version contains less plastic and is more of a grid pattern.A 6-pack of the good ones as of this writing was only ten bucks more ($50.00) so I'd advise going with them. I've used the good version for years to hold books, legal papers, file folders, just about everything and they are strong enough to last decades. These?

"Other reviews tell you what you're getting, let me tell you what you're NOT:1) The rear wireless speaker transmitter/receiver. That piece is model # SH-FX71, about $130 bucks as of 3/27/2011, and NOT in the box. The unit is COMPATIBLE with wireless rear speakers, but the only wireless transmitter that comes with the unit is the USB Wireless LAN. (Other home theatre models have this piece included at similar price points.)2) Speaker wire that is long enough. Worse, the speaker wire even has a proprietary connector on it you have to use when connecting at the main unit (I guess you could splice in additional length). The rear speaker wires aren't long enough for even the smallest of living room runs assuming you'd like to run both cables cleanly along the same wall/baseboard. In my 10x12 room I would need at least an additional 8 foot in length.3) High-quality earth-moving sound. Seeing this system listed as a 1000-watt system you might think it will be a super-awesome system like some of the other 1000-watt systems you've heard (e.g. Bose). You can run 1000 watts through a potato but it won't make the potato sound good. You're getting a $500 sound system, nothing more / nothing less. It sounds really good for that price point, but it will not touch even the worst of the higher end $1,000 and up 1000-watt systems so please don't think ""more watts = more better"".4) Tons of inputs and outputs. You get 1 HDMI out, 1 LAN in, 1 red/white audio in (AUX),  1 yellow video out, 1 digital audio in, an FM antenna connection, a USB connection for the Wireless LAN adapter (that is included), and a custom port for the wireless speaker transceiver (that isn't included). Notice there is NO COMPONENT OUT. If you have a TV from the early HD days you'll probably not have an HDMI port, only a DVI in and some Component inputs. The solution here is to get an HDMI->DVI cable for about 10 bucks (you're losing nothing, DVI is just a subset of the HDMI standard with a different plug type). You CAN NOT use this unit to consolidate a lot of inputs, you'll have to rely on your TV. If your TV doesn't have room for all of your inputs, this unit isn't going to solve your problem. If you have 3 or 4 sources of sound going into your current receiver, that will have to change under this model's limited input availability.Other random food for thought:1) If you don't need the 3D aspect, consider a very similar but slightly earlier Panasonic model SC-BTT730. Seems to be otherwise identical to this model, but quite a bit cheaper AND it comes with the rear wireless speaker transmitter.2) Also, at time of writing Amazon as well as others were selling this same model on Amazon. I always prefer to buy directly from Amazon stocked items when I have a choice because you're going to get the fast shipping, great support, and no tax. The ""other guys"" at time of writing are charging at least $70 more and who knows how slow they ship.3) Remember you are buying a sound system and blu ray system glued together. One breaks = you replace both. You're obviously getting the whole package cheaper, but don't whine 5 years down the road if the Blu-ray player breaks and you have to throw out all the speakers because you must buy a totally new home-theatre-in-a-box (HTIB).Final overview:-At the current price of $530 I would not buy this model again (I have to turn around and spend another $130 for the wireless because my cables are too short)-If this model ever starts coming with the wireless unit for speakers (or you think you don't need it) I would say it would be a good buy then-If I was doing it all again, I would buy either the SC-BTT730, a sony model, or an LG model. They offer the full package for $550 or less. (What I got in my box was a $500 dollar sound system that I have to pay $660 total for.)-Not a bad unit, just there is equivalent on the market for significantly less total cost-------------------Update: Originally I gave this 2 stars, Let me take one away upon update for the following reasons:First the remote. The play/pause/forward/nav buttons you use the most are almost at the bottom of the remote and you can't tell by shape/feel in the dark which way is ""up"". Why would you put the buttons you use the most somewhere on the remote that is awkward to reach? I know this seems like a little thing, but it really starts to annoy over time. (Try holding your dish or directTV remote upside-down and you'll get the idea of what this is like.)Second is the sound quality. It seems to vary a lot, ""creep down"", has poor low end, and poor voice range. First out of the box when I did this review Blu-ray is all groovy. After over a month of watching normal TV, satellite and DVR programs I miss my cheap-o system that broke. I've fiddled with the settings for a while, but it gets quieter and I keep inching up the volume then I flip a channel or source and BAAAAMMMMMMMOOOOOOO it's stupid loud. Clear Voices and Crisp Bass on anything but Blu-Ray? Forget it (even with digital audio in on a high quality source.) I guess the reason they built in a ""whisper"" mode was in attempt to compensate for the poor voice range. When you turn on whisper it goes from awful to just slightly less awful.Third is rear speakers. My original review noted the ripoff that this system did NOT come with the wireless speaker transmitter. I coughed up and bought it for $130 anyway. The connection drops about once a day now and the little connection LED goes red, so I have to climb behind my couch and reboot it. Joy.This thing is now such a piece of junk I'm moving it out my living room as soon as I can afford another brand. After this, I will think long and hard before ever buying a Panasonic anything again. I've owned a lot of their gear before, even another HTIB, but this is a complete disaster.If I was reading this review I would interpret it as some guy really angry at the product looking to run it down. I typically dismiss such reviews. In this case though, please be aware that I'm not mad, it is genuinely a piece of junk because it fails on so many points. One thing or two and it might just be me or a bad set of equipment. There isn't anything ""good"" about this, and a long list of ""bad"". I'm just really disappointed. I read the reviews on this before I bought it and they were very favorable. At the very least listen to it in a store beside something comparable, that alone should convince you to buy another product. I wish I had.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRZARO7GS7G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041DWVKE#wasThisHelpful","R1CRZARO7GS7G1","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To understand this review, know that Name of the Wind (book one in this story) is one of my top 3 books of all time, along side George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Tolkien is a pulp hack beside these works. The two parts from Name of the Wind where (spoiler alert for Name of the Wind:) Kvothe saved the girl from flames in the fishery and played the lute minus a string to earn his pipes will stick with me for decades.(end of spoiler) THIS BOOK, HOWEVER, has NO SUCH SCENES. It is 1000 pages akin to a shallow pool. Just when a certain story begins to take shape and become interesting, he ends it and moves on to another point in Kvothe's life. The writing is as strong as the first book, it's just that the stories are disjointed and brief. The only thing connecting them is that they are all Kvothe's past experiences. If you've ever read a collection of short stories, you'll know the feeling. You can't tell a 5-star story in 25-pages. Jamming twenty decent ministories together in a single book cannot make it somehow collectively better. This book should have been 3 or 4 separate books each giving time to create the richness I appreciated before. A 5-star story makes a grown man laugh and cry when he reads it. It's not a bad book, but it's light-years away from the first one. The disappointment factor alone is worth the loss of a star. As far as the ending, the only way I could tell the book was done was because there were no more pages to turn. It stunk. No cliffhanger, no real closure, no unification of the disjointed stories, squat. Just some kind of weak acknowledgement that he has to stop this trainwreck at some point. It might be some kind of foundation for the next book... not really to be enjoyed itself. Only time will tell I suppose. Is it worth the price and a good read? Yes. Will it satisfy your appetite for more Name of the Wind? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Should you just put it in your queue for two years till the next one comes out? I would.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVLVR7ID3WBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756404738#wasThisHelpful","R2KVLVR7ID3WBT","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Please read update further down...)Orignial impression: I actually bought this for my toddler so he'd stop borrowing daddy's maglight and smacking it on my tile floor. I find myself using it quite often now. The batteries have lasted two weeks with him leaving it on a lot, etc. The light is better than what my mag provides. However - A lot of reviews give you the impression the light shines for miles at super intensity... that's just not the case even on the first day of fresh batteries. It's an LED light and if you have owned LED lights before you know how they provide an inferior light. That said, for and LED light it's one of the best I've owned personally. Combine with the price and you have an amazing value. There are two circumstances for which I wouldn't recommend this - 1) Professional/heavy use (it's built pretty well but wouldn't hold up to demanding daily use for more than probably 3-6 months) 2) Someone needing a portable spotlight that is brighter than the sun (for that go buy the black & decker someone mentioned in the other reviews)UPDATE: I've had this little flashlight for a few months now. The end connector/screw cap is now loose and I have to overtighten it for the battery circuit to stay connected and keep the beam on (the cap is square so it sits funny now against the matching square column). Another thing annoying that you discover from use is that the light won't stand up easily lens-end-down. You never realize how often you do this by habit until you can't anymore. You either have to lay it on its side or hang it by the strap. I would not buy this product again and will have to replace it soon. I think I'll try the black & decker torch that people keep talking about in these reviews. This one will go in the trash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZ7HWRFYXD5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OOZERY#wasThisHelpful","R2JZ7HWRFYXD5M","ABIB0DRRDLN7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIB0DRRDLN7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After wearing she was happily surprised at how warm (but not hot/sweaty) they were under her work shirt in 20 & 30 degree F temps.

"This Adora Playtime Baby weighs less than a pound and is about one foot head to toe. Wee ones will find her easy to carry and maneuver. She smells like a freshly powdered baby. Her face is detailed simply with lightly painted eyebrows above big eyes that close when she “sleeps” and pink lips pursed just so to be forever ready for her bottle (included). Molded hands and feet are similarly simply detailed with suggestions of finger and toenails. Her pajamas are cute with a polka dot pattern and matching cap with little pink bow. Beneath the pajamas is a stuffed cloth torso to which limbs and head look to be securely attached. The “baby” and her outfit are machine washable, something that I consider a major plus. I refrain from buying anything that contacts skin that can't be cleaned before putting it into play or use. There are less expensive “first baby” dolls to choose, but I'd have no issues paying a bit more for the extended longevity that I perceive comes with an Adora Playtime Baby.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJ8QURMG8PZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFREGMA#wasThisHelpful","REJ8QURMG8PZ1","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DII Professional Bib Apron is functionally designed to cover just about every body shape and size. The apron’s length and width are generous and the neck and waist straps are long. The waist straps simply tie together. At the neck, one of the straps has double metal rings hanging at the end. To secure, the second strap is passed through both rings and then reversed, over one and through the other, tightening as it's pulled. Overall, the construction looks to be strong with stress points double stitched. If I could change anything, it would be the weight of the fabric. I found it too light to repel liquid or keep voluminous splatters from passing through to the clothes beneath. Everything considered, I recommend this DII Professional Bib Apron to anyone, with the caveat to avoid being splashed, especially by tomato sauce and the like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGASJSUT674QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119ODFSE#wasThisHelpful","RGASJSUT674QM","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these Philips Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. For one, they are a fraction (1/4) of the cost that I paid for the Bose headphones DH desperately wanted for his birthday. First, I have had no problem connecting with multiple devices. It may be as simple as the fact that I read directions, but I’ve not experienced any of the problems DH has encountered with having to repeatedly re-pair with his devices. Second, the Philips Headphones are drastically lighter; I might forget they were on if they weren’t snug (perfect to stay on without slipping). The third reason, range, is probably the clincher for me. It’s not necessary to even carry my phone when wearing my Philips’ Headphones. I didn’t lose bluetooth wandering through the whole house, up and down stairs, going in every room, and finally walking out to the garage. DH can’t go more than a room away if he doesn’t take his phone with him. I admit that I’m no audiophile. DH is all about making sure he gets the best hi-fi sound. He says he can tell a difference between the two headsets and that his Bose reproduces sound better. He has nuanced perceptions in many aspects of our life and is a casual musician, so I’m sure he’s telling the truth; but I'm neither nuanced or a musician. I couldn’t tell any difference in sound between the Bose and the Philips headphones. I think there’s no going wrong with buying these headphones for non-audiophiles; the price and quality are the biggest selling points. I also think that anyone that’s paid two to three hundred bucks for headphones, might want to leave them at home if there’s a chance they could get damaged; these could be a less expensive backup to wear out. All in all, I’m impressed and recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OWNDBHRMEM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HAPIY6#wasThisHelpful","R10OWNDBHRMEM5","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My expectations of the Lifefactory’s Hot Beverage Glass Bottle weren't very high, I expected it to be not much more than a restyled travel cup, not much different than any that have taken over an entire kitchen cabinet shelf. The Lifefactory's Hot Beverage Glass Bottle, aka the Hot Bev Glass Mug, turns out to be both more and different.Normally, for the first couple of hours every morning, I keep a coffee cup in my hand or within arm's reach. Those mornings I'm running slow and have to leave before getting fully caffeinated, I switch to one of the travel mugs.Reading the Hot Bev Glass Mug’s accompanying product copy, I came to understand that the company intends it to be more than just a travel mug. The Hot Bev Glass Mug is meant to serve as an everyday mug.It looks nothing like my everyday mugs and the idea of using it as such made me raise an eyebrow, but it also makes sense for my personal circumstances: I'm clumsy to the point of sloppy. I'm responsible for daily spills, dribbles, and coffee cup rings on the kitchen counter, vanity and desk.I'm giving up on cups in the morning. This Hot Bev Glass Mug makes so much more sense. The glass is the same as that in our Bodum coffee press, so I know it's tough, high quality. A wide top allows plenty of room for stirring. The sleeve over the glass is thick and substantial to not be burned but still comfortable to hold. The cap screws down to seal tightly. The one I received has the classic cap and functions much like a sippy cup. With the cap left open and the bottle turned on its side, as if I knocked out over, leakage is slowed giving plenty of time to catch before making a major mess. If I could change anything, it'd be a slightly bigger handle to accommodate larger hands or fingers bearing big rings. I'll be buying additional Hot Bev Glass Mug for home and now have a great gift idea for my caffeine co-addicts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSS2SNS5V3JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161KQ4PM#wasThisHelpful","R2TSS2SNS5V3JC","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenox’s 2015 Merry and Bright Santa is a glazed ceramic holiday figurine designed with small cutouts to look like a quaint, old fashioned tealight holder. However, this Santa isn't old fashioned. The candlelight like glow from within is actually thanks to a 21st century battery. Sitting on the couch with Santa in front of me a few feet away, the battery powered light flickers and looks surprisingly realistic. It's only up close that he gives away his secret. Somewhat sculptural, Santa has a jolly face and big beard and a nicely detailed cap, jacket and belt. The figurine has a smooth, uniform clear coat  glaze that looks kiln fired. Depending on point of view, one might consider it charming that some painted portions appear to have been applied by a somewhat amateur hand. A swatch of Santa's red coat in back looks to have been missed being painted at all and his black belt wanders outside the line. As a long time lover of Lenox, I have a higher expectation. I don't particularly like that there wasn't more attention paid to applying the paint, but these little flaws are all but invisible in dim light. Other than that, the figurine looks perfectly made without some issues others noted with the switch and battery cover. I like that an old fashioned appearing decoration is built with a high tech feature and appreciate the novelty and its whimsical nature. This Lenox Santa figurine would make me genuinely smile if I received it as a gift, and I like it enough to buy and gift to someone else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWZUFNAPJFYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJW12#wasThisHelpful","R1IWZUFNAPJFYH","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was probably a mistake that I read some previous reviews about the EZVIZ’s mini 720p indoor Wi-Fi camera. They left me with such a sense of trepidation about the install / setup process and my chances of success that I procrastinated for days.Deciding that today was the day, I prepped over coffee this morning by rereading the instructions, downloading the app and setting up a cloud account, then I went for it.None of the issues others have had were encountered. I’ll share what contributed to my flawless install. My device is a HTC M9. The app was downloaded from Google Play. ISP is cable, 60 mbps down, 5 up. Network is via a separate wireless router dedicated for media and smarthome gadgets (Echo, WeMo, etc). The coffee was whole bean Jeremiah’s Hawaiian and the music was tunein’s “Difference FM” station.It took longer for me to decide where it would be used than it did for the entire installation and setup which included drilling screw holes to secure the metal plate. In less than fifteen minutes, I was done and watching live feed.The live feed is available to watch all the time. Still pictures can be taken and recording can be manually activated through the app. Otherwise, the EZVIZ captures when there is activity.The camera is said to be motion activated, but I think sound may factor too. Viewing our cloud clips, I noticed it records immediately before there's motion; each clip I watched starts with an empty hallway shot followed by the motion of the person or dog entering the frame.Motion and still picture quality is good enough to identify objects, animals, people, etc. It's far from high def, but I didn't downgrade my review because high def wasn't promised or expected at this price point.I love this little camera and am buying at least two more, one of which will be the model that allows two way communication (this model only captures audio, you can hear but not reply through the camera).Speaking of more cameras, it appears one account will cover cloud storage for multiple cameras, but I'll be double checking. The first year of the cloud comes with the camera; afterwards it's $5 a month or pay $50 at once for a year subscription and save $10.For anyone thinking of a WiFi camera for remote surveillance, EZVIZ has models with better picture quality and more options (2 way audio for instance), but I'm very pleased with this one for now. It works great, is easy to install, uncomplicated to use and is priced just right for testing the remote camera waters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPFXALPFS56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167KVZTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EPFXALPFS56","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I understand a discount when it applies to an old model after a new model comes out, or when something is out of season and no longer in demand, or the item just isn’t a good seller and there’s a big inventory to move. I don’t understand discounting almost everything almost all of the time; I mean, is a permanent sale really a sale? I don’t know, but it makes sense to me to ignore the lure of the discount on any brand that seems to have a perpetual sale. There have been multiple times that I’ve been attracted to Invicta watches for sale on Amazon at a hugely discounted prices. I never made the jump to purchase, but I kept looking and realized Invicta watches are on sale a lot, if not always. For instance, drilling down today, 96% of Invicta’s wristwatches, 2,013 of 2,093, are on sale at a discount of “70% Off or More.” I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, but to be aware.This Invicta Men's 21658 Specialty Analog Display Swiss Quartz Gold-Plated Watch has a luxury look and some components of higher end watches. It has a Swiss quartz movement which are generally considered to be more reliable and accurate than mechanical movements. On the other hand, collectors consider watches without batteries, ones with mechanical movements, to be more valuable because they demand more craftsmanship. The dial is synthetic crystal, praised much more than the alternative mineral dials on less expensive watches. Another hallmark of luxury is the clasp on the band of this watch; it’s a foldover with two button operation. It looks to be solid metal with no plastic components, at least that I can see, which is another plus when determining whether a watch is high end or not. Being water resistant isn’t as great as being waterproof, but resistant to a depth of over 300 feet is respectable. The 36mm 18k gold plating is the same as what’s used on many Rolex models, so it’s also a good sign. In fact, just about everything that’s visible on this Invicta is comparable to way more expensive entry level and mid level luxury watch lines. They all come together to make one leans toward believing that this watch, priced 85% less than List, could be an incredible deal for less than $100. However, if I was being asked to pay full price, I’d probably not jump before considering other, more revered watches priced the same as this when (if) there’s no discount.I love this watch for all it promises to be and for the savings opportunity it might represent, so five stars for the watch at the current 85% discounted price, three stars at full price, four overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G7BGGN95120Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKVU8#wasThisHelpful","R2G7BGGN95120Y","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scharffen Berger Chocolate is the company that brought back “bean to bar” processing in the United States. When the chocolatier began manufacturing their own chocolate in the late 1990’s, the norm was to make products using already processed chocolate bought in bulk from wholesalers. The first American company grinding their own beans on site in fifty plus years, the Scharffen Berger Chocolate production process began by selecting beans as a winemaker selects grapes. Like grapes used for wine, Scharffen Berger Chocolate used beans from a particular location to produce “single source” bars, each with their own particular flavor. Scharffen Berger shares its San Francisco home base with Ghirardelli Chocolate and See’s Candies; three of the nation’s top ten chocolate producers.I am most familiar with Scharffen Berger’s Venezuela bean and Tahitian vanilla, high cacao content dark chocolate. It was the “secret” ingredient of a flourless chocolate cake recipe that I made on and off for a decade. Whenever I ordered the chocolate, I’d get extra for a not too sweet treat.When I didn’t have as much time to spend  in the kitchen, homemade complex desserts were the first things I stopped making. Plus, it wasn’t necessary to make my own flourless chocolate cake after I found an almost as good one locally for little more than I used to pay for ingredients.Seeing this Scharffen Berger Chocolate gift box made me salivate a little and I jumped on the ordering opportunity. I prefer dark chocolate, but good milk chocolate makes me happy too. I was just surprised that half the bars being sent were milk chocolate because I remembered dark as Scharffen Berger’s claim to fame. The explanation was clear when the bars arrived packed inside a box inside another box labeled “Hershey’s Chocolate.” The original company being acquired by Hershey’s wasn’t a disappointment to me or anything; I appreciate Hershey’s and have eaten a lot of their chocolate in my life.Tied with a bow, a window box wonderfully displays the individually wrapped, different colored bars. It’s a nice presentation. Given as a gift, it would require wrapping to not reveal the contents. Not seeing my once favorite dark chocolate and vanilla bar disappointed me, but just for a moment.All four bars have nuts. Two dark chocolate and one milk are flavored with salt. The second milk is a coconut and macadamia combo. Although I liked it, it wouldn't be my first choice to indulge. The salt flavor is pronounced, not subtle, but I recognize that salt is an individual thing. My preference would be a lighter touch with the salt, especially in the milk chocolate, but I’m the only one that shared that opinion; no one else that sampled the bars with me mentioned salt as a negative.I can't compare these dark bars to my memory of Scharffen Berger’s original. They either had a higher percentage of cacao or there's more sugar in the dark formula now. Even though Hershey's owns the company, I don't think the milk chocolate in these is the same used in Hershey's confections. Again, I'm a Hershey's fan, but their chocolate isn't as smooth feeling as that used in these Scharffen Berger Chocolate bars.I like these bars a lot but it's not quite love. For one, milk chocolate and the Scharffen Berger Chocolate label don't go together in my mind. Still, I'd very much appreciate receiving this box of chocolate as a gift. I believe most chocolate lovers would feel the same. I'd have no qualms giving it to someone else either; the box is attractive and feels substantial and I think the chocolate is higher end, better than most.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FI6OICO0SF1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QQ4WHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FI6OICO0SF1Y","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm looking at this BLACK+DECKER BDCS20C 4-Volt MAX Lithium-Ion Cordless Rechargeable Screwdriver from the perspective that it's smaller and less powerful compared to the Black & Decker BDCS80I 8V MAX Impact Screwdriver . I'm guessing that the volt difference is why this one is more affordable, although neither is that expensive anyway. Regardless of volts, cordless just aren't as powerful as plug ins. I see that this one needs to be kept on its charger whenever it's not in use. The battery is not replaceable; once it stops taking a charge, it'll be time to retire the entire tool. That said, I'm not taking off anything for it inevitably going dead; it was made to be inexpensive, not to last a lifetime. All in all I like this little Black & Decker, it's a perfect size to have handy for little jobs. Ours sits ready to go at all times in the laundry room. The one thing I don't like is the change in design that removed the little rubber bit holder. We're lucky to have a drawer beneath where it's plugged in or I'd be more aggravated. impact screwdriver is non-reactionary. Also, because this isn't an impact driver, when there's resistive torque it twists and stalls. In other words, you'll only use this little Black & Decker for small, easy jobs. I recommend getting one of the bigger impact drivers for primary use, look at corded first if you expect to do any jobs that need real torque or will take more than an hour. All in all, I like this one for its convenience and small size, but as a backup to keep near.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2I6DDVNHP7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM2T9C2#wasThisHelpful","R2R2I6DDVNHP7O","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenox’s 2015 Snow Majesty Snowflake is big, shiny and resplendent with sculptural details. Marked as 11th, It looks made for collectors, but I imagine it would be liked by just about anyone that decorates for the holidays. It's a sturdy piece with some real heft. Weighing over a third of a pound, it is at least twice as heavy as the heaviest of our tree ornaments. Given its heft and size, it seems best suited to be displayed on its own, as a focal point, or to accentuate another item or decoration. With its included luscious red ribbon, this snowflake (or better, a few) would look beautiful hanging with stockings above the fireplace, or as part of a centerpiece, or from a light fixture above a dining table; just about any place where the brightly finished snowflake could capture enough light to get its twinkle on. I'm hoping to get lucky and am waiting on a sale to grab more Lenox ornaments because I think they’d be great to give to favored teachers, neighbors, etc.; I'm thinking cash tucked inside would be a cool way to take care of those people we tip at the holidays. I love these for the decorating and gift giving possibilities they provide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1Q85SMSK25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNIX6W#wasThisHelpful","R2K1Q85SMSK25","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two different age ranges are given on the product page for the Baby Genius Talking DJ Interactive Hand Puppet with Electronic Sounds by Manhattan Toy; twenty-four (24) months to (5) years is quoted in the “Product Detail” section in the middle of the page, but twenty-four (24) months to thirty-six (36) months is quoted at the top in the bullet points just beneath the Amazon banner, near the “Add to Cart” button. When the toy arrived, I checked its label. Per the manufacturer, the correct recommended age range is twenty-four (24) months to thirty-six (36) months.Regardless of recommended age, I’m not great at determining what level of excitement a toy will bring until I see it in play. If the child was living with us, I’d have a better shot of getting it right more often. Still, I’m right more than I’m wrong; not bad as I only sit for a few hours a week immediately after pre-school and the occasional weekend when mommy and daddy need a break (the frequency of which has increased proportionally to the child’s age, almost monthly now).This is one that I got wrong. At three, she’s already a fan of Melissa & Doug Farm Friends Hand Puppets. In anticipation of watching her with the different brands of puppets, I asked her mother to include Melissa & Doug’s in her bag. The Melissa & Doug puppets don’t speak and their mouths don’t open; they have stuffed heads, so one’s hand doesn’t even go all the way up. After giving her the Baby Genius Talking DJ puppet, I expected it’d quickly achieve favored status because it’s more easily animated. Instead, the moment it spoke, she took it off and only pick it up again during the next hour or so of puppet play when I asked her to show it to me. It was the only one that she didn’t bring to me to put on and play with her. There’s something special about the Melissa & Doug puppets that captivates her, but I have no idea what it is; I really like DJ; I'm betting he'd have been my first choice when I was three years old. Mom picked her up this morning and DJ went home with them, maybe he'll grow on her.From a construction perspective, the Baby Genius puppet is made of higher quality fabric with a moveable mouth and detailed eyes; it’s smaller overall, but it doesn’t look dwarfed. I like most things about it, except that it’s super tight. I don’t find it the fault of the Baby Genius Talking DJ puppet that she didn’t seem to have interest. Afterall, if it had been me making the decision on the puppet(s) to buy, I’d have gone with the Baby Genius Talking DJ. That said, I’d recommend everyone take a look at both; for the price of one Talking DJ, I could get four mute Melissa & Doug puppets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9BPV5GWGEQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPW03QC#wasThisHelpful","RI9BPV5GWGEQ0","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2007 I was given Norton's new protection software, called 360, to evaluate and review. I liked that so much functionality was bundled together: virus protection /detection, phishing protection, maintenance and backup all in one. I bought licences 2008 through 2013 and especially liked when the option to buy it for multiple devices was introduced. In 2014, shopping around to find a good renewal price, I learned Norton was pushing renewals to Security, that 360 was being phased out. I went with Security and remained happy; from my perspective, I couldn't tell any difference except for the product's name change. This year I was approaching the deadline to renew and was still trying to find a discount. I've learned that software is an item that can vary widely in price; it's not unusual to find it from 3rd parties for as much as 75% less than buying from the manufacturer. Obviously, I jumped on the chance to get the 10 Device version of Security free to evaluate. However, I'd have happily bought it for the price it was being offered at that day (still that price today). I like everything about the product, but have some issues with the degree of preplanning and extra steps necessary to not pay full price, but that's my hangup. For convenience, Norton will happily store account information and automatically walk customers through the annual renewal process for which they bill whatever the full price is at the time. Personally, I hate software renewals setup to auto bill and download. Therefore, I don't agree to it and choose to do it manually. Norton doesn't make it as easy. In the last few years I've become accustomed to using Norton's removal tool to get it off each device on the day I'm going to review. Then I do a complete install of the latest year's version and reconnect each device to my Norton account. It's a hassle, plain and simple, but worth it to me to save some money. People whose time is worth more than mine can avoid the hoops I jump through to save a buck; just sign up for Norton's EZ-PZ auto renew process. In the years that I've been using Norton, I've not had any intrusion, virus, etc issues. Some fiends that use freeware have experienced the opposite; one's pc was completely taken over because he proceeded to a site Norton would have warned me away from. I love Norton Security for all it does and because I can work around their auto renew process and save a buck, or opt for convenience and let them do the heavy lifting automatically for full price. It's all about options and functionality for me, and Norton delivers consistently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HG8L7HX1Q2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144NYEY6#wasThisHelpful","R4HG8L7HX1Q2J","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In August 2009, I bought my husband a Panasonic ES8109S Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry. He didn't warm to it at first and it took a week or more of use before he decided that it shaved him just as close and was easier than his hand razor. We later learned his reaction was pretty much the norm when guys switch to electric. He got into the groove of it and I became accustomed to regularly hearing the cleaning mechanism cycle through the process.In 2011, during a maniacal cleaning frenzy (pre-inlaw visit), I knocked it hard and caused its suicidal dive from bathroom counter to hard ceramic tile below. I immediately replaced it with the newer model Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc3 Men's Electric Shaver. Two years later he said the razor didn't seem to be performing as well and began to drop hints about wanting a new one. I went online and learned that the manufacturer recommends replacing the Outer Foil yearly and the Inner Blade every two years. I ordered both and, following the simple instructions, I had them installed minutes after they arrived. The next morning I made a point of staying nearby when the shower turned off. Shortly after I heard the razor buzz on, it turned off. He came to the door and found me standing there. Wide eyed, he thanked me and said it worked like brand new. I was amused that he went back to shaving, not even a little curious to know what made the improvement. From then on I've ordered foil and/or blade replacements from Amazon as needed.I expected him to be excited when I showed him this newest model, the Panasonic ES-RT97-S Men's Electric Shaver and Trimmer. Sitting in place of the old one, I had it charged and ready for a test drive. Excited? Au contraire mon frère. He was more interested in what I'd done with the old Panasonic and I had to show him it was stashed beneath his sink before he'd try the new one. His reaction was basically ""meh."" It isn't that he dislikes the new ES-RT97-S, he says it's every bit as good as his old one, but no better. The few design changes aren't enough to give him preference and without a beard or mustache, the addition of the comb attachment isn't important. When asked whether he liked it more or less than the ES-LT71-S Arc3, he'd rate both the same, 5 stars. For him, he'd be happy with the Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc3 Men's Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System, but if he grew a beard and mustache, he'd be appreciative of this ES-RT97-S's new trimming comb attachment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KA5SQJSJDXDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R1KA5SQJSJDXDH","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got to say that using canning jars to drink from didn't feel really trendy back in the days we were working part time, pinching pennies and going to school. I absconded with a case of my mother's jars to use when four of us set up house off campus.At a holiday party last year, the same type of canning jars were the focal point of a catered dessert bar. Some were pre filled with brownie slices in layers with chocolate mousse and chips, others had pound cake and strawberries and there was a version with lemon curd and shortbread pieces. ""Chefs"" in white jackets stood ready to complete the jars with each guest's desired combination of toppings: fresh whipped cream, liqueur based chocolate and fruit sauces, toasted warm nuts, etc. I couldn't help but think of the old jars we had to use in place of glasses and smiled at the irony.This Aladdin Classic Mason Salad Jar represents a new level in the beverage / salad / meal / dessert in the canning jar concept. Its obvious plus is that it is less likely to break than a glass jar and some may put a high importance on its nifty, built in container that holds dressing separate until serving time. Things I'm not thrilled with include the cautions regarding its potential to be marred by utensils that can scratch plastic or stained by certain foods. It has a high price compared to buying an old fashioned 32 ounce glass jar (when on sale, I can get a dozen glass jars for about the price as this one jar). It's true that the Aladdin Classic Mason Salad Jar's plastic lid won't rust and is less likely to discolor, but the glass jars' metal lids are super cheap to replace, plus plain plastic screw top lids are available from most glass jar manufacturers.The big difference and singular option that I can't find available with glass jar alternatives is the built in dressing container. Personally, I don't see a need for it as most of the salad in a jar recipes begin with a first layer of dressing. I could work around keeping an ingredient separate if required until serving. Any old jelly jar or other reclosable small storage containers would suffice.That brings me to my last thoughts of cost and efficiency. I see them as the Aladdin Classic Mason Salad Jar's major disadvantages. If I'm dicing and slicing, prepping for a handy to go meal, I want to do more than one at a time. It saves more time to do three or four at once; when I calculate the price of buying three or four containers, I'd go with buying multiples of the old fashioned, less expensive glass jars. All in all, I find the Aladdin Classic Mason Salad Jar to be thoughtfully made with its own advantages,  but for my life, it's just okay and only as an alternative to my first choice of buying basic canning jars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3DBEVE1DU83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142JS20E#wasThisHelpful","R3O3DBEVE1DU83","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our fourth ""Classic Accessories"" cover. We've had the first, a blue Belltown Patio Lounge Chair Cover for about a year. We used it mostly through fall and winter to cover a couple of chairs that we didn't stow away with the rest of the patio furniture at the end of summer.It can get cold in the Pacific Northwest during the winter, but it isn't like it was in the Rocky Mountains. When it's not raining on the Oregon coast, it still gets into the sixties and we jump at those opportunities to have the occasional cocktail hour on the deck at sunset.Both the Sodo and Belltown designs have generally the same features (ties, drawstring, built-in storage bag) and the fabric seems to be the same weight and density. The Belltown cover is  two toned and looks a bit more higher end than the one solid color Sodo cover.Each cover has plenty of room to easily fit over two of our patio chairs when stacked on top of each other. This one is a perfect fit for our love seat. The covers' ties and drawstrings help make them fit snug. The fabric is light, but feels strong, and moisture beads up noticeably instead of soaking in.As for easy on / easy off, I have run into problems with the off when I haven't taken care to not tie the cover down around decorative edges or scrollwork on our old iron chairs. It's probably not a problem for most patio sets.The only potential negative for me is that the covers don't completely wrap, leaving possible entry points at tops of chair legs near and at the seat's underside. Most people probably don't worry about accidentally surprising nesting rodents and such, but it's a concern when living outside of cities in areas with tons of wildlife.I like Classic Accessories' covers and don't think you can go wrong with either the Sodo or Belltown styles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R206XS5H2LYIPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MU00FC#wasThisHelpful","R206XS5H2LYIPE","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My child strolling days are long behind me, but I jumped at the chance to get this Diono Buggy Tote Bag. These days walking or hiking means pushing around a senior weiner dog that has a bad hip and separation anxiety. His younger bros can go all day, but he's good for twenty minutes tops before he's hurting, dragging a leg and in need of a ride. This Buggy Tote solves a couple of long standing issues I've had, the first being accessing my phone without coming to a stop. I can now position my phone to see caller ID. It has multiple compartments including a sleeve that perfectly fits the take along water bottle. The large area has plenty of room for the collapsible water bowl, poo bags and his harness and a smaller one now dedicated to hold treats. The tablet sleeve is a decided plus if I should ever have cause to take mine along when hiking. Luckily, it's easy to put on and take off, so I'm able to remove it from the handle and stash it in storage space below when it starts to rain. That brings me to my one enhancement recommendation.. a pull over flap or cover so that it could be left in place during inclement weather. Over all I found this to be a smart solution and think anyone regularly pushing a buggy or stroller would love one.

"Walnut Hollow has been around forever. Beginning as a family tree farm, they evolved to manufacture wood surfaces (and more) sold in craft and hobby stores, often as part of a kit. If you've done any wood crafting from kits, like decoupage on wood, wood burning, etc, there's a good chance you used a Walnut Hollow basswood product. These three foot stakes, a dozen in all, are from kiln-dried, furniture grade wood that's been cut and sanded so that little to no prep is necessary before use. I spotted no spots or knots or discoloration; each stake matches the next. For those of us that find it important, these stakes are made in the U.S. by an American, family company. I wanted these stakes to use for signs through 2016 (we're obnoxiously political); after that I'll retire them to the yard where they can live out their years stakeing up blackberry and raspberry bushes.

"I agree that giving a dog a treat is infinitely easier than trying to brush his teeth, but one treat wasn't enough to substantiate Nutri Dent's claims that their 3-Prong Edible Dental Chews freshens breath or reduced plaque and tartar. The ""Filet Mignon"" flavor was strong enough to get all three of our dogs interested, but only two actually ate their whole treat, in comparison to Greenie Dental Treats which all three gobble in their entirety. Like Greenies, these are priced higher and are designed to help maintain good oral health compared to more simple treats one would use for training or rewards. I appreciate that Nutri Dent's 3-Prong Edible Dental Chews were created with a natural formula and have no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, added sugar, animal digest or corn. Because of all that and since Nutri Dent is made in the USA, I'll definitely consider them again, but since our dogs seem to favor Greenies more, it'll be as a backup.

"We were introduced to bamboo charcoal when we received some from a friend after she finished her service in the advanced medical clinic at Torii Station Army Base in Okinawa Japan. Her gift to us was loose pieces enclosed in a lovely, loosely woven cylinder shaped bamboo basket. She explained that the charcoal would absorb odors and to use it instead of baking soda to keep the fridge smelling good. She said she also kept a bigger basket hanging over the clothes hamper in her teenaged boys' bedroom. I tried the fridge trick and found she was right. When it seemed to lose effectiveness, I followed her instructions to put the charcoal in direct sunlight for a day to refresh and use again. It continued to work for over a year until one day even the sunlight refresh trick wouldn't work. I tossed the charcoal, went back to baking soda and filled the basket with potpourri and gave it a home in a bathroom. Four years later and I was happy to see bamboo charcoal available on Amazon. The bag's bigger than the old fridge basket and I've already used its handy loop to put it to work. Our dogs go through two dog doors to get outside. The area where they first come back in is smash and can get a funky smell during the rainy season. Even though their run area outside is covered, they still manage to get a little wet when doing their business. Plug-ins and sprays barely help with the wet dog smell. I'll update if it does not, but I have high hopes that my new bag of bamboo charcoal works as good as the basket of charcoal used to in the fridge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OJZPYFSK5GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WED0WHW#wasThisHelpful","R15OJZPYFSK5GT","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The options that were available before Poo-Pourri were a joke or embarrassing to use. The aerosol cans in particular are a bane; they don't work great and, big as they are, aren't exactly discreet; plus, there's the grossness factor of picking up a can that others have touched after their grand finales. I knew that my bottle of Lavender Vanilla Scent Poo-Pourri had leaked before opening the delivery box. As recently as this morning, the scent left on the broken down cardboard box is making our trash can the best smelling one on the curb. There was still a third or so of liquid left in the bottle, so not a total loss. When used as directed, the Lavender Vanilla scent is all that's detectable and it stays around for a good hour or so after flushing. I am impressed with the effectiveness of this product, especially since I ordered it as a gag. Anyone that wishes to be discreet and / or courteous will appreciate having Poo-Pourri handy. I'm crossing fingers that there's a version on the horizon for those that don't care; a Poo-Pourri that fits internally (in the toilet, not the person) and auto dispenses. Now, that's a version I'd buy by the case; for now, I'll buy a bottle or two at a time and place prominently by the throne.

"We bought this new 880 made specifically for pets and allergies. The purchase severely hurt the budget, but the return is bringing comfort to an allergic household member that is not physically capable of vacuuming. I had no idea of the importance of vacuuming until this highly sensitive individual joined our home; it simply has to be done daily. My spouse and I have done a good job of staying on top of it, but we've each had our misses and realized we needed a contingency plan; I recalled seeing a Roomba at someone's home and decided it could be the solution. Having a home with tile, hardwood and carpeted floors, my expectations were that we'd have to limit the Roomba to one area at a time. As it turns out, it's not necessary, the Roomba moves seamlessly from one floor surface to another. In an area with a thick rug on top of hardwood, it's usually a matter of it just rolling on and off, but I have seen it take two attempts. On tile and hardwood, I think the Roomba works better than any vacuum we've had. I deliberately set the Roomba to vacuum the kitchen's tiled floor immediately after using a Dyson Animal. Considering the floor had just been vacuumed, the amount the Roomba picked up was amazing. We've been playing with configuring the two included ""lighthouses"" to effectively guide the Roomba room to room, but I think it's going to require manual intervention to completely work. We're currently running the Roomba on a nightly schedule in the open plan area of the house. By the time I wake up, it has run its course and recharged. In the morning I empty the bin and carry the Roomba (handy carrying handle) to a different room and let it clean until it stops. The first few times, before letting it roll free, I'd forget to scan for obstacles. After a few loud incidents, it's become habit to remove or raise all that I can (chairs and trash cans on to tables and desk; shoes, dog bed and toys to closet; floor fan set outside of door, etc).

"Wellness is one of a small number of pet food manufacturers recognized as producing a legitmately premium food. Wellness makes their food in the U.S.A. without fillers, meat by products, artificial ingredients or anything sourced from China. Since WellBars Natural Wheat Free Oven Baked Dog Treats are from Wellness, consumers can be assured that they're high quality and pooch worthy.The difference between dog food and dog treats / snacks is nutritional. Treats aren't made to meet daily nutritional needs and often contain ingredients that aren't considered essential nutritionally. It's like me and my daily chocolate fix. It might not kill me to eat nothing else, but it wouldn't be healthy. Chocolate doesn't contain all that I need to meet my daily nutritional needs, but I can  ""treat"" myself daily in moderation.These are different from many empty calorie treats. Wellness WellBars help supplement a dog's diet with antioxidants (vitamins C and E and Beta-Carotene). They're small, chunky shaped rectangles. For my dogs, I like that the shape, size and texture encourages chewing versus gulping. All of our dogs went for these without hesitation, despite being meatless. They smell good for dog treats, sweet even; I was reminded of the sweet smell that comes with opening a box of gram crackers. As with every other Wellness product we've purchased over the years, I trust them completely to give to my furry family members.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVXSO8DI79TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002H3R2E#wasThisHelpful","R3MVXSO8DI79TP","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this is my first drone, I can't verify TX Juice's claim that this is the ""easiest to fly drone."" I can say that the learning curve is easier than what I went through with my first remote controlled helicopter.If your instructions aren't in English, don't do anything before downloading the correct ones from the company's website (TXJUICE DOT COM). Many thanks to the reviewer that previously mentioned this, or I'd have gone a little nuts.For instance, without the instructions, I wouldn't have realized why the drone's best feature for learning, auto-hover, wasn't working. I tried first in the work area of the garage that's covered with rubberized mats. Because they're flat black, there is little reflectivity and the sensor, the a.i. component, is useless. It wouldn't hover until I moved it to the smooth concrete floor.At first, it moved left and backwards, it wouldn't stay hovering in the same place. From having flown my helicopter, I knew it was a trim problem, but would've been lost for a fix without the instructions. Playing with the forward and right trim buttons burned battery time and the drone had to be charged again before it was ready to try again.I've some way to go before I'll be proficient with the controls, but I'm much farther along in a day than I was in week one with my helicopter. Being able to keep the speed on low and have the drone maintain its height while playing with the directional joystick is a big benefit to getting a feel for its operation.So far, I'm liking it. Even though I was disappointed by its small size (my fault, the dimensions were there for the reading before ordering, but I didn't), I'm okay with having it in order to build skill.A neighbor flying a drone with a ""ghost"" hanging below it scared the bejebus out of me, my sister and the kids last Halloween. I'm hoping TX Juice's AI drone will build my skills enough that I can justify ordering a bigger, more powerful one to have my own fun this Halloween.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209048MG7DIQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R209048MG7DIQT","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I checked earlier reviews of Zillionz Voice Activated Safe after ordering it. If I'd seen them first, I would've passed. As it worked out, the safe I received works better and opens more consistently than expected. For the price, I didn't anticipate the voice activation to be state of the art, and it's not. We recorded a pass code that failed to work at all at first. Tired of the alarm, I ended up using the reset feature to get it open. Since setting it a second time, it's worked every time, but not always on the first try. I'd love to share what made the difference, but I'm clueless. We didn't play with it for more than a couple of hours, so only time will tell if the problem reviewers previously reported had been fixed. For us, after the second setting, it continued to operate within two tries. If there's a change, I'll update the review. That said, I'm still not going to love the safe even if the voice activation continues to work. I understand that this is labeled as a toy safe, it's not made to safeguard the family jewels, but it's really more like a piggy bank than a safe. With very little pressure, hubby popped open the door with his thumb. It caused no damage and once closed, it was impossible to tell it had been opened. As a kid, I wish my sister would have had this safe. I could've snooped in her diary or snatched from her candy stash without leaving a trace. Unfortunately, she had a lockbox (very much like this Schylling Locking Cash Box). Overall, Zillionz Voice Activated Safe is a piggy bank in the shape of a safe, unique only for it's voice activation access function; without which, it wouldn't be that interesting. For a kid's novelty, it's okay, but to give my kid a sense of having real treasure security, I'd go with the tried and true metal bank or box with a key of combo lock.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OF7PN7KKRJMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00421BD72#wasThisHelpful","R1OF7PN7KKRJMP","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our bathroom has a soaking tub and  separate shower. I wanted to find a spray hose to fit the tub's decorative faucet. It's long, wider than it is tall, and tapers down from the wall to a rectangular opening. Water runs from the faucet projecting over the tub, about a foot past the the tub's edge. This was the second hose that I tried and is a third the cost of the first. I like it because, even though they looked the same, the rubber nozzle on this one is less firm. I couldn't squeeze the first hose's round nozzle to fit over the rectangular opening. This hose looked like it would present the same problem, but the rubber nozzle proved to have just enough extra flexibility; it slipped right on. Don't misunderstand, it's not something that I want to regularly put on and take off. It's being left on and it doesn't hinder the filling of the tub. For the price, fit and flexibility, I rate it 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2SBNELNJDE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QD2WJS#wasThisHelpful","RO2SBNELNJDE7","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been leery of electric space heaters, but this Duraflame Infrared Rolling Power Heater completely changed my mind. It's a good looking wood unit that appears and feels quality made and comes fully assembled. I've no worries about tripping over it or tipping it over; it's substantial in size and heavy. It heats up quickly and, thankfully, without the ticking bomb sound or high pitched whine that turned me off space heaters in the first place. The kitchen, dining and family room are part of a large open floor plan area divided only by half walls and bookcases. We tested the heater there; it's a bit over 1000 square feet, but the Duraflame Infrared Rolling Power Heater was able to warm it corner to corner (with two reverse slow spinning ceiling fans running). One cautionary note: be cognoscent of where you plug in the heater. The plug I initially used is on the same 15 amp circuit used by the flat screen, stereo, gaming system and back lights. Turning on the heater tripped the breaker and shut everything down. I checked and learned the heater is rated at 12.5 amps. Gaming and watching TV would be out with the heater running if another circuit wasn't available. There are other circuits in the area, but a space heater isn't needed there anyway. I only wanted to see how it performed in a big space and it performed great. The included remote really ups the utilitarian factor. Turn the heater on and off, set its timer and change the temperature all from the other side of the room, thanks to the easy to use remote. The timer function in particular is a plus. Considering the heater maxes out at 1500 watts, some big money could burn up if left running longer than necessary. We'll use the heater only occasionally, in a space that was created when we added storm doors to each end of a breezeway. It's a nice, bright room with wicker furniture and lots of plants, but gets too cold a few months every winter to enjoy. Not anymore. I love that our Duraflame Infrared Rolling Power Heater can make the area usable all year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367HG2JIHDKU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K172S3Y#wasThisHelpful","R367HG2JIHDKU3","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of ""Would You Rather."" As a party or conversation game for adults, it's an icebreaker and a means to get insight. Sometimes it's way more revealing of aspects of others you never wanted to know. I like that there's a version for the young. ""I don't know"" and ""I don't care"" are rarely acceptable answers from adolescents in real life. They're never acceptable in this game. The game requires that a decision be made in order to move on. It represents an exercise in, maybe even an introduction to, critical thinking, with the ice breaking benefits of the adult version. Like the adult and teen appropriate versions, it is the cards that make the game. Player pieces, game boards, etc seem extraneous, fluff, but their inclusion is understandable from a marketing perspective since multiple websites provide Would You Rather questions for all ages for free. For this age range, there's probably not much that's appealing about home made games delivered via mom's ink jet printer. If a colorful box with cards and extras works to spark interest in playing, I see the worth. Otherwise, I'd pick one of the websites appropriate for the age range and print the questions and put the money towards something not so easily reproduced at home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2COWI2A5GPF7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGR5G3U#wasThisHelpful","R2COWI2A5GPF7J","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a new themed edition of a popular game called Fluxx. The original Fluxx, unthemed, has been around at least a decade. The basics of the generic original and the newer themed versions of Fluxx are the same. None are complex and all are easy to learn, a group of novices can be up and running in ten minutes; having experience playing doesn't give an advantage. Set up consists of not much more than shuffling a deck of 100 cards and dealing three to each person. The cards are color coded and labeled: Action, Goal, Keeper, New Rule and Surprise. The card category, Creeper, is in some versions / themes, including this one. You'll want to note that not all themes have the same age range (there is at least one 18+ version). The principle of game play is the same in all versions / themes: follow the rules and be the first to achieve a goal of obtaining and keeping specific cards. Play begins with one simple rule; each player must pick and play a card. It's all about luck of the draw. From there the game can end quickly or spin into chaos. At any one time, only one rule and one goal directs the game, but the rule and/or goal can change with every player's turn. One draw can change hopelessness to hopeful or blow up an imminent win. Moans and laughter travel equally around the table. Fluxx is one of those games that rates high enough in the household for regular occasional play. It doesn't sit long enough to draw substantial dust, but it's not first out of the bookcase of games. Once out, it's good for at least four rounds before interest wains and other games get pulled. This Fluxx deck, ""Adventure Time,"" is going to best suit fans of the show with Finn and Jake. The manufacturer's recommended minimum age is 8. I'd guess 15 for the top range. If your game closet doesn't already have a Fluxx deck or two, check out the variety of themes available. There's something for most gamers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWQWADXABM17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCTMC7E#wasThisHelpful","R1FWQWADXABM17","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of three brands of jeans ordered in the last six months, these Wranglers run the most true to size. The waist, 36, is perfect. The length, 32, is closer to 33, but if they're going to be off, I'd rather see longer than shorter, so these are fine. I should mention that they were washed according to instructions before wearing. The fawn color is a nice break from regular blue jeans and looks less casual. The material mix is also a plus.

"Axe's Apollo 2 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner didn't rank as an Axe product that would find a permanent place on our shopping list. It's marketed as a shampoo and conditioner in one, but it didn't seem very conditioning. I've used a number of the combo shampoos, in comparision Axe's Apollo 2 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner left my hair feeling dry with more flyaways. A plus for me is that the shampoo's scent isn't as strong as others by Axe that I've tried. I'm not rating it less because of it, but the shampoo and conditioner leaks out along the line where the bottle and the cap snap together.

"I try to minimize staining my teeth, but sometimes stains are unavoidable. Coffee is the worst but I can't quit caffeine, it's all that keeps me from being mistaken for the walking dead and shot. Red wine is another staple, but whitening be damned,I'm not going to look the fool and drink wine through a straw. In between professional teeth whitenings I rely on bleach strips, but I don't use them as diligently as needed because I find them to be a hassle.I've only used the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System for a week, but can see the results are better than I get with the strips. I already brush twice a day for two minutes (actually, my Philip's Diamond Head goes for 2.5 minutes). It doesn't matter that I need to stop after a minute to apply the product's second step, the process still feels like my daily routine. I don't have to be extra diligent. Without making any big changes except toothpaste brand, I can brighten my teeth in between dentist visits without the fuss and expense of strips. For someone that wants to whiten teeth for the first time, or has gone longer than recommended since their last whitening, I doubt this will bring the results as quickly as wanted. On the other hand, for anyone like me that struggles with bleach strips in between whitenings, I whole heatedly recommend trying Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing Toothpaste and Whitening Gel System. For me it's really a simple solution in comparison and I'm very pleased. I can see staining is reduced and I love how super fresh and clean my mouth is left.

"I'm so old that I used to pull music from vinyl to make mixtapes for our parties and road trips. That evolved to CDs for dinner parties of every kind, from barbeque to blacktie. These days, I have playlists for just about every event or activity. With streaming music services I can set up an entire list or just que a couple of songs. Doing it on the fly and being able to have songs flow into the next makes me feel like a Junior DJ. I've played with a few mobile apps for mixing with some success, but I never thought of having my own DJ Controller. I've thought of them as something for pros, too expensive and too steep of a learning curve. I am pleased that the Hercules Universal DJ proves me wrong on every point. Don't get me wrong, I am not looking for a DJ gig now, anytime soon, or ever. I am, however, looking forward to becoming more skilled. After the easy initial setup (software install) I knew I was going to have some fun. The Hercules DJ Controller lets you control two deck wheels, plus has a mixer and sampler and effects. The PC display portion shows a BPM (beats per minute) box and wave line with each deck. The BPM number and the wave line show each deck's tempo and lets you look ahead point-by-point in the song. These help big time beat matching, sampling, and adjusting fade, flow, etc. There is much more to the controller, but I'm not there yet. DJUCED mobile apps allow music to be pulled from multiple sources, not just the PC and one gives the ability to use a smartphone as the controller, in case you want to join guests instead of sticking behind the device. There is a way to make and share playlists and even have people vote on what they'd like to hear. The Hercules website has a promo video that shows lots of what I have to look forward to accomplishing. If you too have had fun with mixtapes and playlists, and especially if you've used an app to sample, fade or flow or played with itunes preferences for mixing, I'm positive you'll love going to the next step with Hercules' DJ Controller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSC0IBKH9CXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8MSAXY#wasThisHelpful","R2GSC0IBKH9CXO","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I question why the ambiguous ""Holiday"" is in the title. Check out the colors, candy canes, stickers with Christmas tree and wreath decorations and the little Santa. There are no fireworks or valentines or turkeys. Heck, Thomas says ""Merry Christmas"" as he rolls; no references to Mothers' Day or any ""holiday"" except Christmas. This is a Thomas The Train CHRISTMAS Train Set.The age range is three to six years old. That's got to be for play, because assembly is a completely different matter. Six should be the minimum, not maximum; even then, I'm talking about a six year old destined to skip some grades. These are not ready made individual pieces of track that connect  to make a loop for Thomas; the sections don't come assembled. Rails, buildings, hills, candy canes, various shapes and lengths of track, etc get snapped together, in different ways, to make the individual sections. I can't say how long assembly would take one adult; I'd guess about an hour without a little helper, if you know what I mean. In retrospect, from a saving time and hurt feelings perspective, I'd say it's better to surprise any little loved one under six with the set completed.The track is designed with added interest in the form of hills / bridges that raise and lower the train as it moves through the slightly pentagon looking loop. Interactive play is accomplished with start and stop switches on the track. At one, Thomas ""pops out"" Sir Topham Hatt (Santa) from his house and stops to let him aboard. A plastic barrel full of imagined candy canes can roll down a ramp into a car at the next stop. Thomas pushes through a door to enter a tunnel on his way to his next stop, the school, where the cargo car of gifts can be unloaded. Santa and his house, the barrel, the tunnel door and the gifts will stay as they are from that point on unless replaced and reset in their original positions.Putting the pieces back in place and running Thomas around the track again in order to pull the switches again seems to be the extent of play. Big Thomas fans could find it eternally entertaining, especially hearing him chug, chug, chugging along, yelling holiday greetings and whistling, always whistling. Personally, I would have appreciated the option of turning Thomas' audio off, but to each their own.I'm rating this four stars for Thomas The Train lovers, less for non-fans. Without a big Thomas lover in the house, like our house, I think it'll prove to be more decoration than toy. Whimsical and Christmas themed, I'll enjoy it decorating the space beneath our tree this Christmas season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2E46S07G1SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST819DC#wasThisHelpful","RU2E46S07G1SX","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The joy of having blooming plants in the home year around, plus the peace that comes with starting seeds, taking cuttings, transplanting and nurturing plants that burst with big beautiful blooms, led me to explore less expensive options than high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, specifically the metal halide and high-pressure sodium (HPS) I had been using. The electrical cost of running a 1000W light twelve hours a day, plus $100 annually for replacement bulbs, became too much to pay for a hobby that produces no income. One choice considered was going with less wattage, like running a 400W or 600W HPS instead of 1000 to reduce the required amount of electricity. There would still be an annual cost to replace bulbs, plus the added upfront cost of a new ballast. Workable, but still more money than I want to spend on my hobby. I became fascinated by the possibility of a using LEDs. The idea of a less expensive fixture, lower wattage consumption and bulbs lasting ten years versus one is super appealing. I explored LED possibilities. Reading some hobbyists' online gardening journals was a big help, I saw that the OSRAM SYLVANIA PAR38 LED is Grow Light with many fans. At the heart of the popularity and ingenuity of OSRAM SYLVANIA PAR38 LED Grow Light is that it is optimized to make the right amounts of reds and blues available for every grow stage. I know next to nothing regarding the effects of applying different qualities of light, except that it's important for the plant to be able to pull what it requires as it ages. OSRAM SYLVANIA PAR38 LED Grow Light's spectra appears to do exactly that. The OSRAM SYLVANIA PAR38 LED Grow Light's appears to match HPS lighting's color spectrum at a lower cost.

"These are Foodsaver rolls labeled also as GameSaver. If you wonder what makes them different from regular FoodSaver rolls, their website explains: ""There is no difference in the design or the quality.. GameSaver bags and rolls are conveniently packaged with multiple rolls. FoodSaver® rolls are sold individually.""Bags or rolls, I like both. The pre-made bags are easiest, but a roll gives lots of flexibility to make bags sized just right, which can make rolls the more economical choice.Whether I'm buying bags or rolls, I only buy the FoodSaver (GameSaver) brand, despite the cheaper options available. I received samples of an alternative brand promoted to be as strong as FoodSaver. There was no need to test the claim, it simply took a side by side comparison to determine it was bogus. The plastic is textured differently and is noticeably thinner than the FoodSaver brand.My objective when vacuum sealing is to keep food fresh longer and/or save money by buying in bulk and freezing in portions. It makes no sense to me to risk a bag failure.I think that using cheap bags with a FoodSaver vacuum sealer is like putting cheap tires on an expensive sports car; the car will be drivable but it isn't going to perform as intended and if a tire fails, it could be ugly.Having tried multiple brands, I continue to prefer, use and recommend FoodSaver products as the best available","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYSQOR9MWG7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARW32VA#wasThisHelpful","RMYSQOR9MWG7C","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I couldn't be more pleased with the Archer C3200 Tri-Band Wireless Gigabit Wi-Fi Router. The wireless router it replaced was already going to get the boot for ghosting, disappearing and reappearing on the network and slowing things down while devices reconnected. I was going to replace it with a different brand router when this 1G TP-Link was made available in Vine. Even with a networked home office, multiple wireless smart televisions, tablets and laptops, 1G exceeds our needs. A one processor router rated at 100 Mbps would still suffice, but this bad baby's in and I'll be taking advantage of its options (setting up networks to prioritize devices is number one). An amazing benefit that was unknown to me before hand is that it's eliminated the need of two network extenders. With the old modem, there were two problem locations; one at the opposite corner of the house was a complete deadzone. Adding extenders was necessary to solve the problem. They're no longer necessary because of the Archer C3200 Tri-Band Wireless Gigabit Wi-Fi Router's incredible range (it has six antennas). It's slightly heavier than its predecessor with a solid, stable feel when set in place. Front LEDs are in front and very visible. Despite its advanced qualities, setup was as easy as any other router. Admin functions are easy through a user friendly interface that's intuitive to a degree with easy to understand directions.  I look forward to growing into the capabilities this router offers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Z9CEIKQ1S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","R5Z9CEIKQ1S0","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We didn't have to go far to try out this Five Star Extra Tall Locker Shelf and Drawer. We have a PrimeTime Locker by Gladiator GarageWorks GarageWorks,GASL1TAMDG in the family room for extra movie and game storage. The plan was to use stacking plastic crates on the inside, but it proved near impossible to find crates that fit and stacked. The movies and games that have accumulated are in messy piles and I've been thinking it wasn't such a great idea after all. Then, lo and behold, Five Star come out with little gem that appears to be just the answer to getting the locker organized. Unfolded, it fits exactly; the shelf sits on legs that raise it more than a foot above the locker's floor. What makes these shelves perfect is that they stack! For our purposes, I'll be ordering two more. With three stacked, they'll be about four feet high. Consider the floor, and the top shelf the locker came with, we can have five levels to stack movies and games. The plastic drawer is barely an inch tall and doesn't look to hold much. I'm not discounting its value just yet, but it isn't much of an add for me right now. If three units turn out to be unstable or if I change my mind about anything, I'll revise my review, but for now I'm loving this shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35712B1E2DY5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NR4QK#wasThisHelpful","R35712B1E2DY5J","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little notebook is made tougher than most. The cover is plastic and the spiral binding is protected by a cloth sheath. Given the extra attention to details, I was disappointed to see that it is one use only; the paper can't be refilled. It's very handy for making the almost daily to-do-list and it fits perfectly in my SUV's console. A movable plastic sheet can divide the notebook into sections; each section could have its own purpose or be used by different people (for use as a shared his and her to-do-list perhaps). The built-in pen loop eliminated having to rummage around in the glove box or console for a writing utensil. I would recommend this highly to anyone looking for a small notebook that's easy to carry and can take a little abuse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUIJIY9OUR66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NT1QQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YUIJIY9OUR66","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd agreed that a couple of little eight year old special someones could stay up until they got this constructed, so I thought that I was being played when two hours came and went and it was still in pieces. It was my night to be ""off,"" so it fell to my spouse to bring it to an end. Using his own kid friendly profanity (snuggerfuts!) and infinite patience, he was able to help them get the various scattered bits assembled into a final product. The problem was one of strength; some pieces required real muscle power in order to achieve a full connection. Play finally began after a few test runs identified which tracks needed additional adjustments. They barely played an hour before being done with it for the night. The next morning they had another hour before their mother picked them up and they spent every possible minute with it until they left. It waits for them on the dining room table and I notice it wobbles a lot when I pass by. I spoke to T2 (twin two) this morning and asked if he loved it or liked it (like) and if there was anything people buying this should know; he said to say that it needs more marbles. In short, this The Learning Journey Techno Gears Marble Mania Zoomerang Building Kit (100-Piece), Multi may require adult assistance to put together and, if you buy it, you should consider buying extra marbles too.

"It's been almost sixty years since Edward Lewis Wallant's ""The Pawnbroker"" was published. I think the writer of the forward sums it up perfectly: It`s ""a novel about not only about the Holocaust, but about responses to trauma.."" This is a post-Holocaust story. Sol Nazerman survived the Holocaust but is the first to say he has no heart. He shares the home he pays for with his sister's family plus supports the household of his girlfriend and her father, but this is a man who is alone. He seems to have little regard, or even care, for those people closest to him. His pawnshop in Harlem is really a money laundering front for a gangster; even when his life is threatened in the course of business, he shows no interest in life; at the same time, he isn't suicidal. He has an apprentice, Jesus, a young man that works at the pawnshop to learn Sol's business secrets as a means to escape his life's circumstances. Jesus is also a survivor of trauma. The pawnshop customers are depicted as people trying to survive their individual traumas. The story builds to an unexpected moment that forever changes Sol and Jesus' lives, as well as those around them. This is a novel I think worthy of reading regardless of decade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QXC2UBUUTS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493149#wasThisHelpful","R19QXC2UBUUTS2","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Tyrannosaurus Rex is not a toy that moves or functions on its own with a flip of a switch. It has to come to life in the same way toy soldiers, baby dolls and cars without engines do, with imagination. The ""stomp"" sound feature is activated when T-Rex is moved manually. Pushing the tail controls the ""chomping jaws."" The chomping feature is not designed to break skin or cause pain; but it could help give flight to fantasies of chewing on enemies (like toy soldiers) or prey, or whatever a kid can dream up. The stomping and chomping are imagination enhancers. It's great details will help. They show in its different textures and shading, and the little beady eyes and wicked looking teeth. When imagination wanes or play time is over, any dino lover would find it worthy of display. I think this will be a fav toy for many.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUFEZR4I48XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG00FM#wasThisHelpful","R1NUFEZR4I48XK","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suave's Professional Line products seek to ""work as well"" as the products sold in upscale salons. This Firm Control Sculpting Gel was developed to work as well as Sebastian Gel Forte, 6.8-Ounces Bottle. Without having used the Sebastian product, I can't compare the two. As a daily user of gel, I still have an opinion. The company is marketing a product as able ""to work as well"" as a more expensive competitor. My regular gel, L'Oreal's Strong Hold Gel, is priced about three times higher than Suave's product. Both purport to provide a strong hold and shine. I like that Suave's scent is subtle and neither masculine or feminine; from that perspective, it would work for everyone in the house. An amount of Suave's gel that was equivalent to the amount of L'Oreal's that I apply, didn't prove to provide the same hold. Strength of hold was about the same, but not the amount of time that each gel held. I had to add about half as much more of the Suave gel to hold for as long. For the price difference, it's still a money saver compared to mine. I also thought it was Suave's gel that won a shine comparison by a hair (sorry!). A not-so-great difference showed up, literally, the morning after using extra of the Suave. I ran my fingers through my still semi-stiff hair and saw flakes of dried product fall. Ugh. No doing that in bed again. Against the dark red pillow case and sheet, enough were visible to make me think of dandruff. I concluded that while the price is better, the extra amount I had to use created the dandruff snow. With shorter hair, I probably wouldn't have run into the problem, but since I don't, I'll stick with my tried and true. I like Suave Professionals Sculpting Gel, but not enough to switch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ESPWGLX6BPGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UJYDC#wasThisHelpful","R2ESPWGLX6BPGS","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One serving microwave convenience meals in a bag or box have been handy to have around. I can't say I've loved any, but they work when things get busy and I can't make myself a meal, or go out for one. My biggest complaint is many have homogenized flavors and textures. Bite after bite tastes and chews pretty much the same. The Pace Ready Meal bag is see through at the bottom and designed to open easily and then function as a bowl. I looked at the contents through the bottom of the bag before putting it in the microwave. From what I saw, I expected another unmemorable microwaved ""shelf stable"" meal. I was wrong. For one thing, I could make out the flavor of the cumin in the smell and taste. I'd like more of it, but what it has is more than I'm used to tasting in instant meals of this type, so kudos for that. I'm not saying the flavors are nuanced, but for a sixty second meal, I was happy that I could taste the spice and enough of the two types of peppers to tell one from another. There's a note of lime in the sauce that pairs well with the cumin. There is more sauce than I expected compared to the bag's picture. I was expecting something closer to casserole consistency but it's more like a super thick soup. The rice didn't disappoint because I didn't have high expectations, but I'd have enjoyed the meal more if it had been firmer. This meal's rice reminded me of the squishy, super soft texture of instant rice that's sat too long in liquid. That said, at least it didn't turn into the hot cereal consistency that I've experienced in other shelf stable meals with rice. I could take or leave the chicken. I found the taste, density and texture of the all white pieces of chicken acceptable, but nothing to crow (sorry) about. Marketers have noted that ""ALL WHITE"" chicken seems to be perceived as being better by many, but cooks know that in casseroles, soups, etc., it's the dark meat that brings the flavor. I wouldn't serve it to dinner guests or use if for anything else than what it is, a time saving alternative for killing hunger. I don't love it, but this Fiesta Chicken & Rice Ready Meal from Pace is the best shelf stable meal I've had yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTGBIDPWJMLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105E0TEM#wasThisHelpful","R1YTGBIDPWJMLT","A28I98PKHZZKVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28I98PKHZZKVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was at an 'in-between-books' impasse for a couple days, then picked up a book I'd found at a library sale last summer. The book is EVERYMAN, Philip Roth's 27th book, published in 2006. It's a grim little tome, with a black dust jacket, the one-word title framed by a thin red-line square, the author's name writ large in white block letters, and a black and white photo of a stern-faced Roth, arms crossed, on the back cover.I only vaguely remember reading the original EVERYMAN - a 15th century morality play - or some version of it back in graduate school. Its Christian theme of life and death and a final accounting of ones deeds in life to determine whether one deserves salvation - heaven - or not seems an odd thing for Philip Roth to be writing about. I mean, he is Jewish, after all, and, judging from his writing, he puts little stock in any kind of an afterlife. So I was not surprised to find this story a pretty dark one. The unnamed protagonist - Everyman, I presume - is retired to the Jersey shore from a successful career in advertising. He has been a philanderer and hedonist, married and divorced three times, and now, at 71, finds himself alone and in declining health, having survived numerous heart surgeries, with six stents inserted, as well as a defibrillator, and faces more of the same on the immediate horizon. His two sons from the first marriage have little to do with him. His daughter, from the second, is devoted to him, but, divorced with young twins, has problems of her own.Everyman, alone and sometimes agitated and afraid, reflects back on his life, summing up his many mistakes. He wonders how he's ended up this way, and how it's all gone by so quickly, still mourning the loss of his beloved parents, as well as his own youth and virility.I don't know if EVERYMAN was a bestseller, but I strongly suspect it would not have been a popular choice for book club discussions among the elderly. It's just too damn dark, too starkly honest about the winding down of life, too sad. But I love the writing of Philip Roth. I'm frustrated too that I've not managed to keep up with his prodigious output. (I felt the same way about Updike's stuff.) The first Roth book I read was PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT, which, at 25, I found howlingly funny. My first year of teaching, I even used it in a literature class, and this was in a pretty conservative, solidly blue-collar sort of community. What was I thinking? I still wonder, over forty years later, how it was that I was never summoned to the Department Chair's office over a complaint from an outraged parent. Nope. Never happened. But I do remember it was kinda hard to get a good class discussion going about Alex Portnoy.After PORTNOY I went on to read several of Roth's other early books. One of them, LETTING GO, remains a special favorite. Of his later books, I loved AMERICAN PASTORAL and THE HUMAN STAIN.But this book, EVERYMAN, despite its dark theme, touched me with its truths. I nodded in agreement when I read the following passage, about a trip Everyman makes to the beach community where he spent summers with his parents and brother. He has lost interest in his painting and doesn't know what to do with his time.""... it was still his beach and at the center of the circles in which his mind revolved when he remembered the best of boyhood. But how much time could a man spend remembering the best of boyhood? What about enjoying the best of old age? Or was the best of old age just that - the longing for the best of boyhood ...[?]""An interesting question, no? Indeed, I spent five of the most enjoyable years of my own retirement doing that very thing - remembering, and not just my boyhood, but my whole life. And writing it all down, or trying to. Four memoirs in six years, and now nothing for the past five. And I wonder. What's next? Do I have more to write of my own life? Or do I keep on doing only this: writing about other people's books? It's a question I ponder on an almost daily basis, as I continue to read and read and read some more.Yes, I could relate to Everyman. At a particularly low point near the end, he has just visited his second wife, who has had a crippling stroke; then he made some difficult phone calls to friends who were terminally ill and to the wife of his former boss, newly widowed. And then, ""what he wanted to do ... [was] to revive his own esprit by phoning and talking to his mother and father.""His parents by this time are both long dead, of course, but I understood that urge, that 'want.' I've had it myself.I understood too the sadness of Everyman at no longer possessing ""the productive man's male allure."" And I nodded sadly yet again at his realization of what was probably left for him -""But now it appeared that like any number of the elderly, he was in the process of becoming less and less and would have to see his aimless days through to the end as no more than what he was - the aimless days and uncertain nights and the impotently putting up with the physical deterioration and the terminal sadness and the waiting and the waiting for nothing. This is how it works out, he thought, this is what you could not know.""Yes, EVERYMAN is a pretty unrelentingly sad sort of book, full of grim, unwelcome truths about how things really often do turn out. If there really is a final reckoning, as the 15th century EVERYMAN play suggests, then Roth's Everyman would undoubtedly ""have some 'splainin' to do"" as Ricky Ricardo might say. But Philip Roth? Yeah, I know he's had a couple of wives, and all the scholars and experts say a lot of his work is highly autobiographical. But even so, I think I would LIKE this guy. I think it would be great to sit with him over a coffee and talk about things - about books and writers and writing, and, and well, about life in general.Roth was featured in a PBS special last year, and, if I remember correctly, he may have said he's done writing. That he is retiring. It's not something you hear very often from writers. Mostly they just keep on writing until, well, until they die. Updike did. A couple friends of mine, Curtis Harnack and Ed Hannibal, did. But then I remember that another author, mystery writer Lawrence Block, recently announced his retirement too. So what the hell, if Philip Roth wants to retire, then he should. But I hope he enjoys it more than his own poor Everyman did. I just wonder what he'll DO, ya know?So, anyway, if you should happen to read this Phil, and you're bored, call me, okay? We could meet at McDonald's and get our senior coffees, and we could talk books.

"PEPPERLAND is Barry Wightman's insightful and imaginative look back at the music of the seventies, the last years and simmering aftermath of the divisive and unpopular Vietnam war, as well as the birth of the personal computer, a development that will move the world from an analog to a digital basis, an ""epoch-making paradigm shift, that ... will change the world.""That's a mouthful, I know. But it works in this page-turning rock and roll love story narrated by Martin ""Pepper"" Porter, a Chicago kid who studied computer science at U of M in Ann Arbor, where he met Susan (Sooz) Frommer, an ahead-of-her-time computer whiz in a field dominated by men. Following a passionate affair between the two at a summer camp, Sooz disappears, becoming part of the notorious Weather Underground, on the run and under cover. She reappears a few years later when Pepper, having rejected employment offers from IBM and other major firms, is just hitting it big with his quirky rock band, Pepperland (which features an insurance-selling accordion player a la Weird Al), co-founded with his brother, Dave. It is 1974, the year of Watergate.But, putting PCs, politics and protests aside, PEPPERLAND is, perhaps more than anything else, about magic. And not the Lovin' Spoonful kind (although that's in there too), but a more mysterious kind of magic involving unexplained coincidences, a Dark Stranger, an Epsteinian manager named Cool Papa Creach, and a guitar. That guitar - a Felix the Cat model - seemed to have magical qualities of its own. I was reminded of Roy Hobbs's bat, Wonderboy, in Malamud's The Natural, with all of its dark Faustian intimations. And I wondered too if Creach's musical nickname 'Cool Papa' might have been a subtle nod to the famous Negro league pitcher, Cool Papa Bell. Because Wightman adds touches of abundant authenticity to his tale everywhere you look. The small record company that Creach manages, Checkers Records, is obviously a nod to Chess Records, a Chicago Blues scene institution (think Chuck Berry), which actually did have an even smaller subsidiary named Checker Records, whose biggest act was Little Walter, who gets a brief mention. And the bands Pepperland opens for, some coming up, some on the way down, are real ones you might remember: Mott the Hoople, Pavlov's Dog, and even that Houston funk band, Archie Bell and the Drells, who taught us all, back in 1968, how to do the ""Tighten Up.""Wightman obviously knows the seventies music scene inside and out, with numerous references to the blander pop acts of the era, with gentle jabs at Tony Orlando, The Archies, Don McLean, and America, and reveals the music of the Carpenters as a secret guilty pleasure of even hip types like Pepper and Sooz, who sing lustily along with ""Top of the World"" on the car radio.Chicago in the seventies figures prominently in the plot too. Wightman uses it, wending us through its suburban streets and various downtown places like the Playboy Club, the Quiet Knight saloon, the Martha Washington Apartments for Women, the diners, delis and pizza joints.PEPPERLAND has nothing to do with the Beatles, but I couldn't help but think of them - the Sergeant Pepper album, the Magical Mystery Tour, and Yellow Submarine (which soundtrack even featured a George Martin orchestral piece called ""Pepperland""). And I think Wightman intended us to remember all those things. Because this is a book so rich in reference, so dense in details that you may often find yourself drifting off in memories of your own, memories often triggered by a word, a phrase, a song lyric. And that's not a bad thing. It's good. Good books will do that, you know. They make you think. They make you remember. PEPPERLAND is one of those books. I loved it.

"TRAPLINE is the third in a series of Alison Coil mysteries by Mark Stevens set in the Flat Top wilderness area of western Colorado. I haven't read the first two (Antler Dust and Buried by the Roan), but thought I'd give this one a try, although I seldom read mysteries, mostly because I prefer novels with well-developed characters to plot-driven novels, and mystery-thrillers usually fall into the latter category. TRAPLINE is a typical mystery in that respect, but the story-line is one that rips along at such a brisk pace that I was very quickly sucked into this surprisingly literate and extremely topical tale of ""murder most foul,"" as Agatha Christie might have called it. In fact, the horses that served as one of the many forms of transport in this wilderness mystery made me keep remembering Murder at the Gallop (1963), a Miss Marple film based on a Christie novel (After the Funeral: A Hercule Poirot Mystery) that I watched at an Army post theater in Sinop, Turkey, more than fifty years ago.But I digress. Because, although hunting guide Allison Coil does ride horses in her job, we also see SUV's, trucks, cars, helicopters and even ultralight aircraft featured throughout this story, with various elements ""ripped from today's headlines,"" as Kirkus Reviews has already commented. It starts off with a bang, actually multiple bangs - shots by a hidden sniper attempting to murder a prominent Senate candidate during a campaign stop in Glenwood Springs. Many readers will undoubtedly flash back to the 2011 murder attempt on U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona. And, in addition to the political assassination attempt angle, the hot button issue of immigration and illegal laborers from south of the border figure front and center in TRAPLINE. In fact, these illegals are brutally hunted and victimized and become pawns in a struggle between ruthless opposing factions of big business and powerful shadow corporations. Coil, along with her partner and lover, Colin, is drawn into this bloody mess when a mutilated half-corpse is discovered near one of their hunting camps in the Flat Tops. Local newspaperman Duncan Bloom becomes involved as he digs for stories about both crimes. Another unwitting participant in this increasingly complex intrigue is Alison's friend, Trudy Heath, a businesswoman who specializes in natural and organic foods with her company Down to Earth.Allison and Trudy are closely connected in their passion for nature and protecting the wilderness. Allison's devotion is obvious when she says -""You can't go back ... If you destroy the wilderness, it stays destroyed. It could take centuries or longer for nature to repair the damage ... We owe it to ourselves to preserve the wilderness. We owe it to the animals too.""Trudy's investment in nature is similar, in her beliefs about farming and growing things -""She promoted going rustic. She was growing home crops with the same attitudes as farmers from the 1930s, before things got complicated ... Don't over fertilize, don't over water. Listen to your soil and sunlight, let it tell you what it wants and watch what thrives .. [She] emphasized care of the soil as a living organism and managing the ecosystem so the garden could take care of itself.""There is something of the hippy mentality of the sixties scattered throughout the story, and I thought often of Joni Mitchell's words, ""And we've got to get ourselves / Back to the garden."" There were also distinct 'foodie' touches much in evidence here, in the meals prepared and lunches packed. Things like ""a pot of pork-less possole,"" with an ""organic red wine."" And Trudy is regionally famous for her ""herbs, pestos and other natural food products."" She and her closest neighbors, Allison and Colin, often enjoyed breakfasts like blueberry scones with poached eggs and broiled tomatoes. And there are lunch sandwiches she packs for them -""Whole wheat baguette with cucumber, bean sprouts, tomatoes and some sort of olive tapenade that served, as Trudy put it, as a binding schmear.""These frequent foodie touches, which to me suggested just the tiniest hint of the snob, took me back to another regional mystery series I have on occasion read and enjoyed, Traverse City author Aaron Stander's Sheriff Ray Elkins novels (there are seven), set in northwest Michigan. Elkins, a highly cerebral and literate lawman, is something of an epicurean gourmand and wine lover who often imports meals and ingredients from the trendy Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor.TRAPLINE also brought to mind other books and stories read. The most famous would be Richard Connell's grim and much-anthologized ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" a story I read in high school. Other lesser known books, all about the immigration and illegal workers issue, are John Mort's fine novel, The Illegal; and two non-fiction works, Johnny Rico's Border Crosser: One Gringo's Illicit Passage from Mexico into America and Ted Conover's Coyotes: A Journey Across Borders With America's Illegal Aliens.Mark Stevens, like Aaron Stander, knows not just his mysteries, but pop culture and literature in general, with some sly nods to yoga, George Strait, Rick Bass and Ralph Waldo Emerson. But perhaps the most important reference here is a fragmented quote at the novel's conclusion from Walt Whitman's melancholy ""I Sit and Look Out,"" invoking ""the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon the laborers, the poor ... the meanness and agony without end.""Yes, this is a mystery-thriller, and just one in an evolving series, but Mark Stevens comes across as a guy who reads a lot more than just mysteries (although I'll bet he knows his Christie and Doyle well). He is so much more than just another mystery-writing hack. He is a fellow booklover and it shines through between the clues. So yeah, I liked this book, and will recommend it unreservedly.

"FRIENDSHIP AND OTHER ESSAYS is a conveniently shirt-pocket-sized collectible little book with a leather cover - yes, you can smell the leather - probably published around 1924. I have briefly sampled its contents. ""Friendship"" begins with the intriguing line: ""Friendship is evanescent in every man's experience and remembered like heat lightning in past summers.""This tiny book also contains Thoreau's more famous ""On Duty of Civil Disobedience,"" an essay I found hard to get through back in college and probably still would today.This is a book I would probably only recommend to serious collectors of antiquarian books, but not for their 'value,' as there were more than a million of these Little Leather Library Corporation books published during their heyday back in the 'teens and twenties of the 20th century. Today they would be primarily curiosities or conversation pieces. I value my own copy because it was a gift from a dear friend.

"I loved this book. Gary Reilly's novel, THE ENLISTED MEN'S CLUB, succeeds on so many levels. It's a dead on accurate portrayal of army life in the late sixties; of the anti-war climate of protest, the 'flower child' era, and the summer(s) of love, particularly in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco; and it's also a funny, moving and poignant coming of age story.Reilly's 20-21 year-old protagonist, Private Palmer, starts out the story as something of a kind of blank slate, who wants only to keep a low profile (although he also wants very much to be promoted) and get quietly obliterated on bowling alley beer busts as often as possible. But throughout the story the reader gets further insights into his background, born into a large Catholic family (numbers a bit vague, but there are at least two brother and two sisters), after high school Palmer drifted between dead-end jobs, waiting to be drafted. Trained as a military policeman (MP), he is initially assigned to the Presidio of San Francisco (perhaps one of most 'plum' assignments in the Army), while he awaits further orders to Vietnam, an unpopular war which lurks just offstage throughout the story. Little by little, almost against his will, Palmer is drawn into the lives of his fellow MPs of Company D and even makes a few friends. Things happen, serious things which Palmer cannot ignore, things which force him to grow up and get involved.The thing is, at first I wasn't sure if I even liked Palmer - the loner who wants nothing more than to get wasted on beer. What I liked was the way Reilly depicted the reality of enlisted life in the 60s. Reilly had it down. Here's an early example, describing the mad scramble in the barracks after duty hours -""Everyone is getting out of the company area as fast as he can because nobody wants to get nabbed for sh** details which might spring up without warning, which is the nature of sh** details.""Oh yes, I remember that rush to evacuate the company area during my own early enlisted years in the sixties. And then there was the drinking. Palmer tries several times in the course of the narrative to quit both drinking and smoking, but never quite succeeds, at least not for long, because they are -""... the two things that always go hand-in-hand or else lead to one another. The problem with sobriety is that it makes you feel so good that you feel like going out and getting blasted.""Stuff like this made me chuckle. Too true, and this is absolutely genuine GI thinking when you're only 19 or 20, believe me. I've been there done that - fifty years ago. These kinds of details kept me turning the pages while I tried to decide if I liked this Palmer guy. And then there are the other details of time and place, like the liquor store on Stanyan Street (the home stomping grounds of Rod McKuen, the uncrowned poet laureate of the sixties), the numerous references to the music - ""Crimson and Clover,"" Moby Grape, the Electric Prunes, and the summer of love, the Smothers Brothers, Laugh-In, and the rumors that Paul McCartney was dead. All this attention to detail served to keep me going until a pivotal event in the story that began to turn Palmer around. He is assigned to funeral escort duty, accompanying the body of a soldier from his company back home for burial.The dead man, Thorpe, misunderstood and avoided, had been even more of a loner than Palmer, who feels confusion and remorse over how he had regarded and treated the man. Carrying a tri-folded flag onto the plane with which to drape the casket upon arrival in Wichita, Palmer becomes super-sensitive to the importance of his task, and wants so badly to do things right that he won't drink any alcohol, afraid of getting drunk and screwing things up -""His concern is mostly for the flag, which is why he decides not to smoke, afraid of getting ashes on it, or burning a hole in the fabric. When turbulence jostles the plane, he worries about spilling his soft drink on the flag, and drinks the pop quickly.""From this point on, Palmer became a much more sympathetic character and began to think more about other people and less about himself. He becomes involved in helping a girl he is half in love with who is in an abusive relationship with Palmer's best friend, Courtney. And he selflessly finagles a way to have his older brother's orders to Vietnam rescinded, because of an AR which disallows two siblings serving in a combat zone.Gary Reilly was obviously a guy who read. Because Palmer's story shows many influences. There's a bit of Holden Caulfield in this young man who tries to salvage a sense of self and individuality while part of a system that discourages this, that tries to tear you down and make you an unquestioning cog in the machine of the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower had warned America about. (Indeed the Oakland Army Terminal, the shipping point for troops bound for Vietnam is described as being ""industrial"" looking, ""civilian and factory-like."")There is something of Catch-22: 50th Anniversary Edition here too, particularly in a passage where Palmer, in trying to change his brother's orders ""was only beginning to understand: if you want to get anything accomplished in the army, talk to a Spec Four."" I mean shades of PFC Wintergreen. And there was also Palmer's executive officer, Lt Norbert, comically reminiscent of Heller's Lt Scheisskopf.And the final lines of THE ENLISTED MEN'S CLUB, which find Palmer sprinting desperately away into the darkness, again bring to mind Heller, as well as Updike's Rabbit, Run, and a few more recent works of military fiction, books like David Abrams' Fobbit and Kevin Powers' The Yellow Birds: A Novel.Tragically, Gary Reilly died in 2011. But he left behind more than two dozen completed and unpublished novels. THE ENLISTED MEN'S CLUB is book one of a Vietnam era trilogy. You can bet I'll be first in line for book two.I could say more, but I guess I'll just repeat what I said at the start of this. I loved this book.

"James Kilgo is not a famous author, except maybe down south, where he was an English Professor at the University of Georgia, in Athens, for thirty years. I happened across his book, Deep Enough for Ivorybills (Brown Thrasher Books) a couple months ago in a thrift shop, read it and loved it, even though it's largely about hunting and fishing. I am not an outdoorsy type, but Kilgo has a way of making those subjects, dear to his own heart, branch out to encompass larger and more important subjects, like life itself and what are we here for.So I wanted to read more Kilgo, and now I have. This book, COLORS OF AFRICA, may be even better the IVORYBILLS. It certainly has an added poignancy, knowing that Kilgo died very soon after he finished writing the book, and he obviously knew this would be his last book. COLORS OF AFRICA is another book about hunting, but this time it's about how he fulfilled a life-long dream of going to Africa, as an observer and photographer on a three-week safari in Zambia with a big game-hunter acquaintance. Kilgo had thought his own hunting days were behind him, but when the hunter offers him a chance to shoot a Kudu, he decides differently.Kilgo keeps a record of his time in beautiful history-laden Luangwa River valley and all the various animal trophies his host bags, as well as his own bird watching and that stalking and shooting of the Kudu (a large antelope). But he also weaves in a lot of reading and research about Africa, citing passages from the books and journals of Dr. Livingstone, references to Burton and Speke, as well as a more modern African scholar, Stuart Marks. But Hemingway keeps coming up here too, with frequent quotes from Green Hills of Africa, a book that Kilgo first read and fell in love with during his high school years. He also mentions the film, Mountains of the Moon, which dramatized the explorations and competitions of Burton and Speke. It is a film I too remember vividly, making me wish all over again that I could have known Kilgo and talked with him about books - his and others too.Perhaps what makes Kilgo's books so readable and fascinating is the constant struggle in his own mind and heart about hunting and killing, but his enormous respect for nature and animals comes through loud and clear. This was a complicated guy, who came from a long family tradition of hunting and fishing and spending time in the outdoors, in the Carolina and Georgia swamps and woods mostly. But he also loved literature and thought deeply about the many questions that literature raises. About life, death, and what is our purpose here on earth. Perhaps one of the most poignant parts of the book, that stays with me, is a moment he has about two weeks into his African adventure. One night he is lying awake in a roofless blind in the jungle waiting for a lion to approach the bait - a rotting buffalo quarter - they've hung in a tree. And a huge flock of vultures begins to circle above the blind and land in front of it to feast on the bait. Watching these enormous carrion birds suddenly caused him to remember with a start that he had cancer. But it was the first time he had thought of it since he got to Africa. That's how absorbed he was in this once-in-a-lifetime chance adventure.This is a book filled with history, literature, natural wonders and personal memories. And the kind of wisdom that perhaps only comes when one knows he is nearing the end of things. Kilgo made the most of it, of all of it. Jim Kilgo died in December 2002. COLORS OF AFRICA was published the following spring. It's a beautiful book, Jim. Thank you.

"On the opening page of Jack Driscoll's 1998 debut novel, LUCKY MAN, LUCKY WOMAN, he gives you a pretty damn good hint of what this book is all about. His forty-ish protagonist, Perry Lafond, unable to sleep, is browsing through an old college textbook of his wife's, The Portable Nietzsche (Portable Library). A line from it that sticks with him is this: ""When marrying, one should ask oneself this question: Do you believe that you will be able to converse well with this woman into your old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory ...""Man, old Fred knew what he was talking about, ya know? Especially about that ""transitory"" stuff. After 47 years of marriage, I figure I can tell you that with a certain authority. And yet so many people, like Perry and Marcia (Benoit) Lafond, are in such a hurry to get through college (they met at U of M in Ann Arbor), then get married and start their 'real' lives, that they would put little stock in Nietzsche. At that age, late teens and early twenties, the sap is flowing strongly and everything seems so Urgent. And now, after nearly twenty years together, Perry and Marcia are having some troubles, some failures to communicate, as it were. At nearly forty, Marcia is desperate to be a mother, no matter what the cost. Perry is not quite so sure about being a father. He's got some 'issues' to resolve from his northern Michigan childhood: a little sister who died tragically and parents who never got over it.And, in addition to Nietzsche's thoughts on marriage, Perry also has the thoughts of his older best friend, Wayne, a war-damaged Vietnam vet, who thinks the only common language between men and women is silence. Well, lately Perry and Marcia have been stuck in that ominous silence. Perry, a Connecticut parole and probation officer, has gotten a little too personally involved in the lives of his 'clients,"" and finds himself being attracted to other women. And then he has to fly back to Michigan for a family emergency, even as his marriage begins to go off the tracks.Yes, this is a book about marriage and family in the 1990s. The locales of New London and Groton in Connecticut and Traverse City in Michigan are woven seamlessly into the story. (Driscoll is a kind of state treasure in the latter state, where he taught writing at Interlochen Arts Academy for many years.) But the characters here are just so damn good, so REAL, that I genuinely felt for them. And there is much here to ""feel"" - grief, sadness, tragedy. Driscoll is damn good at this writing thing. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

"Deirdre McNamer's RED ROVER is something of a puzzle, but in a good way. Its diverse characters and its time jumps from 1920s Montana to the post-war 1940s and then all the way to present day force you to pay attention, so you can put the various pieces of the story together. Like the jigsaw puzzles that are depicted as popular with the patients of the Missoula rehabilitation center/nursing home where some of the characters end up - and where lives which once touched only tangentially finally intersect, perhaps for the last time.The story is of two brothers, Neil and Aidan Tierney; one becomes a B-29 pilot flying out of Saipan over Japan, the other an FBI agent sent undercover to Argentina, supposedly to ferret out Nazis. A third man, Roland Taliaferro, who has escaped a hard life in the Butte copper mines to attend college and law school, figures prominently in their lives and stories as a 'good friend' of Aidan, who follows him into the FBI just before the war. Other characters are Opal Mix, an eccentric rural nurse who becomes a town coroner, and Wendell Whitcomb, fatherless and rudderless, who straightens himself out and becomes a newspaper reporter. McNamer skillfully weaves all of these disparate characters into a web of intrigue, betrayals and ruined lives, but she makes you work. She makes you think about how lives really do come together, drift or ricochet apart, and then converge again - all over a period of several eventful decades.I was riveted by this complex tale. McNamer is an outstanding storyteller. Add her to the growing list of great writers coming out of the modern American West. Highly recommended.

"I've never been a big fan of William Faulkner, and this book, SOLDIER'S PAY, didn't change that. It seemed overly pretentious, verbose and pompous to the point of being boring. Faulkner's language has always been dense and ornate, but it simply did not work with this subject - a damaged and scarred veteran returning home to Georgia from the war. I'm always interested in reading books about the World Wars, but this one was just too tedious and did not work at all for me. I gave up on it after about 100 pages. My apologies to the late great Mr. Faulkner, but I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. (Although I did like the retro cover of this old paperback version.) P.S.

"Full disclosure: Michael Bazzett is my nephew, so naturally I was eager to read this book. YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS is Bazzett's first full collection of poems (although he has previously published a chapbook, THE IMAGINARY CITY, in 2012).For someone of my generation, the book's title is perhaps misleading. I guess I was expecting something more in the ""a kiss is just a kiss"" vein of poetry. No such luck. These are poems to ponder, to wonder over. I won't lie. There are some pieces here I'm still trying to figure out and may never fully understand. Maybe it's because his influences are so diverse and, for the ordinary reader at least, pretty obscure. European poets Antonio Machado and Tomaz Salamun (""Imperfection"") figure in, and maybe a little Borges. Homer's The Odyssey (""Cyclops"" and ""Elpenor"") are in the mix, as are Saul Bellow's Herzog (Penguin Classics), and even a nod to former Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten (""September Picnic"").Dreams figure prominently here, in ""After Machado"" and ""In Vladivostok"" for example. And settings range variously from Mexico (""The Horse"") to Canada and Siberia. And there is a definite playfulness displayed in poems like ""Recollection"" in which a nameless narrator puts himself together from his various parts, from his tongue in an ""embroidered box on the bedside table"" and ""pale twinned arms / lie nestled together in a battered cello case,"" to his pelvis ""on a wooden saddle"" and ""the hairy coil of my privates / rests on the dresser, next to a pile of coins."" And there is the ""silent"" ink central to the fanciful ""The Sinclair Gift Emporium.""Sex and sexuality also play frequent roles - in ""Manhood,"" ""The Crisis,"" ""Aria,"" ""Some Party"" and others.A few poems here particularly resonated. ""The Dark Thing,"" a creature stoned and poked with sticks, evoked the ""kill the pig"" frenzy of Lord of the Flies; and ""The Book of _________"" maybe Heinlein or even Stephen King. And ""Orangutan,"" in which a daughter's dalliance with an electric ape produces a result reminiscent of James Dickey's ""The Sheep Child.""I am sure that my brother (the poet's father) will find a favorite here in the final poem, ""The Last Time I Saw God,"" with its nameless narrator rocking along in a night subway car, seated next to God - ""That is when I noticed his slight resemblance to my father.""For some reason as I read this book I kept remembering the Housman poem, ""Terrence, this is stupid stuff."" There's probably no correlation, except that I want to say: Michael, this is strange stuff. But then poetry often stumps me, and if obscurity equals talent, then Michael Bazzett is full of it.

"These are delicious and definitely not a compromise over 'regular' marshmallows. I find the flavor better, so I use these when making both vegan and non-vegan crispy rice treats.My one quibble with these is that they melt more slowly when making the treats, but I can live with that. They are also pricey. I do find that Amazon ships fresher ones than I find in local stores, so I tend to buy mine here rather than at my local health-food store.If you want to make vegan, GMO free treats, use these and Trader Joe's Crisp Rice Cereal and of course Earth Balance instead of butter or margarine.

"This is a very nice quality robe. It is lightweight and short and soft. If you want a skimpy lightweight robe, which I personally find more comfortable than the heavy terrycloth, you'll love this. If you're looking for a plush thick heavy robe, you won't like it.There are two ties, one thin cord on the inside to close once and then the big belt.It is, as shown in the pics, pretty short.

"The flavor of this nutmeg is wonderful. Just opening the jar releases a wonderful aroma. I've been micro grating it, and it is delicious.I love that it is organic and non-irradiated.One area of disappointment: In the past when I've had whole nutmeg (it was a gift from a foodie friend so I'm not sure where it was purchased) the shells were on. Each time you need a fresh seed, you crack the shell. This product has pre-shelled seeds.That's fine if you use it fast, but I'm figuring it will keep it's wonderful flavor for a briefer time period than the whole shells, which lasted me years.I will repost as I see how long these retain flavor and aroma. If they don't last long, I'll get the shell-in kind next time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11I29R2TJDZIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WS1CG6#wasThisHelpful","R11I29R2TJDZIJ","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased one of these for a simple purpose, making tuile (those curled French cookies), and ended up using it so often I bought several more.These are an excellent non-stick paper. The size is 13 x17 size, but the super convenient thing is that they can easily be cut to fit your cookie sheets or other pans exactly. I cut several to fit my professional-sized baking sheets and a couple more in circles to fit my round layer cake pan ,which I usually line with a fresh sheet of parchment paper each time.My original purpose was making tuile, which are small circles of cookies that are removed while hot and folded into the shape you want. You need to be able to get the cookie off the sheet fast, and oiling was a pain for large volume so I got these and my results were great, with a lot less fuss than trying to grease the sheet first.After finishing the tulle project, I realized this is very handy for making other recipes for which I normally use parchment paper underneath, such as baked Chinese pork buns. Another use was for making dumplings: instead of greasing and flouring the cookie sheet to store the just-made dumplings without sticking, I used this. Basically, whenever I  might use parchment paper, I use this instead and wash instead of throwing out.Several reviews note it stains with grease. I haven't used any oil or butter on it since it's nonstick--if I use oil or butter I'd just put it directly on metal. My tuile cookies have a good amount of butter in the batter, but they aren't leaving a stain on this.And another caveat: I have not used this as a liner to make cookie other than the tuile, so I can't vouch for this use. That isn't to say it wouldn't work, but  it isn't an application I'm interested in. Cookies bake great directly metal baking sheets (with no grease usually or sometimes with a thin layer) so I don't have any desire to change, especially given that this is, in fact, a chemically coated product.And yes, another review helpfully states, this product is made with Teflon non-stick coating. Amazon's listing does not state this, but I did check Regency's site to confirm. I am not a fan of Teflon, as well, it's a chemical and I prefer not to have it near my food. I do not have any other Teflon cooking items in my kitchen. However, I knew this was Teflon when I purchased it, and decided to make an exception due to its convenience. FYI, you can also get silicone baking liners, which tend to be more expensive. Some top experts (like Alton Brown) swear by them and say they are inert, and don't react with food. Others argue there just isn't enough research on them yet to know they are safe.For me, these things are a matter of moderation. I don't think science is going to absolutely resolve the safety of this in our lifetime. Personally, I wouldn't have a kitchen full of Teflon or silicone I used daily, but once and a while is probably okay. Make your own call of course. Since I'm not certain silicone is better safety-wise than Teflon, and I like these, I'm happy with the product.To clean, I rinse, or wipe lightly with a soapy sponge as needed, and drape over various kitchen objects to dry if I don't feel like towel drying it.As of this writing, I have used and washed each sheet a dozen times or so and they show no sign of wear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUP6X99HEENW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VYSB6#wasThisHelpful","R3KUP6X99HEENW","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, well designed and constructed Lazy Susan.The wood is a pretty unfinished blonde, which you can leave as it is, or apply varnish as you choose. The item I got was nicely sanded and smooth.I purchased this to serve Chinese meals on for a group, but returned it because I misjudged how it would work for my particular table. The good part is this will hold 3-4 serving platters nicely, but the bad news (for me at least) is that on my table it is so large that it felt cramped when we added the place settings.My miscalculation is not the vendor's fault, and the vendor was prompt and professional about the return, so I'm still giving the item five stars. My caveat is that this size is only going to work on an unusually large dining room table or other big surface; I recommend prior to purchasing that you actually place a test object of this size on your table and then actually set the table to make sure you like the fit before purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYHWOKMDM5MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z9HC0C#wasThisHelpful","R2DYHWOKMDM5MD","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally, a bra that takes into account the way many women use our bras anyway--as a place to stuff things!This item is ingenious, well-made and well designed.It has a double layer of fabric over the chest, allowing for the construction of a small pocket in the front. This pocket is handy for money, keys, kleenex or cell phone if you're going out for a walk or jog. I use it for biking to hold snacks so I don't have to go digging into all my other pockets when I need some energy quickly...it's very easy to grab fast since the snack is tight to my body and convenient.If you put a large item in there, of course it sticks out a bit, but when you're exercising it's better than stuffing it in your sock or wearing a fanny pack or a backpack. It's also better than putting your house keys under a rock because, you know, the thieves know that trick!Other than the pocket, this is a standard well-made sports bra with good support and fabric that holds up over time with washing and tumble dry. It wicks moisture well.I used one for a year and then purchased two more. Once you get used to having that little stash pocket it's hard to give up!One warning on colors: I love the black, and have several, but I tried the rocket red and it wasn't red at all. It is a bizarre neon orange.

"I purchased and returned this as soon as it arrived.First, it was WAY too small. It technically fit the chest size stated if you want your pajamas to fit like a skintight latex dominatrix suit. However, this was intended as a gift for someone who wanted to actually sleep in it, and wanted it to be comfortable.I might possibly have gifted it to a smaller person, rather than going through the hassle of sending it back, except that the item had a strong unpleasant odor. I suspect it is probably formaldehyde, a chemical put on clothes to make them permanent press and improve stain resistance.This is a standard practice in the clothing industry--but there is 'normal' and then there is over the top. In this case the odor was so terribly strong that I had a headache just from handling it a few moments to check the size and then to repackage it to send back. I am not particularly sensitive to odors, and have never before sent back a clothing item due to its smell.I suspect this odor would disappear if you washed it a bunch of times, however, if you are sensitive to odors, or if you intend this as a gift, and expect to give the item to the person prior to washing, definitely stay away.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C46DY3W9P8TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGWF0UI#wasThisHelpful","R2C46DY3W9P8TD","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice quality chalkboard paper. To put it up, you cut along the helpful grid on the back to the size you want, then peel and apply.I purchased this because the brand I used for years, Wallies Peel and Stick Chalkboard Sheet, Slate Gray, Set of 4, while it worked great, comes in paper-sized squares and I wanted a larger chalkboard by my desk without any dividing lines.Compared with the squares, it is harder to install. First of all, you need a sharp scissors. However, even using my sharpest scissors, I did not have the dexterity to make a line as straight as a machine, and I can slightly see the difference. An exacto-knife on a work bench with a protective sheet of cardboard might have done a better job, but I didn't have that level of obsession for the project. I also found it a bit difficult to get perfectly flat without bubbles, however that, and the cutting, are the nature of this type of product and I am not taking stars off for this. Just a warning that if you want a picture-perfect permanent installation this may be a bit more difficult to make look professional than putting up smaller squares and lining them up against each other.This product does not come with chalk--you need to supply your own chalk or use the markers sold by the company for this purpose, which the company says give a better visual result. I chose to use regular chalk, rather than the markers, since I want the board for quick notes to myself rather than for display. Regular chalk writes very nicely on this--similar to a regular chalk board. Several brands of chalk I had available worked great. To erase, you need a damp cloth--in fact I'm finding outright very damp works better than slightly damp, as if you don't have enough water to wash it, it tends to leave wipe marks.The part I'm most happy about: Unlike a competing brand of similar-style peel-off paper, Fancy-fix Vinyl Peel and Stick Chalkboard Sticker with 5 Free Chalks 17.7 By 78.7 Inches,  it appears to be sticking well to my wall. It's been up nearly six days now with no signs of peeling or coming off.The reason for the four stars instead of five is that I so far have only six days' experience with the product, so I'm being cautious. I plan to see how it sticks over time, and how it holds up to repeated washings, and will update my review and star rating based on its longer-term performance.Updated May 6 to upgrade this product to five stars. I have now been using it for four months. It has continued to stick great to my wall, and it has held up nicely under repeated writing and washing. So yes, score, great product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6B4UL5BMT059/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEPPMFI#wasThisHelpful","R6B4UL5BMT059","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good enjoyable read--but not the best of Eileen Yin-Fe Lo's Cookbooks.It's a romp through Eileen's childhood in China with her artistocratic grandmother, learning to cook the old-fashioned way with the help of a team of servants. She eventually escaped to the west when she was worried the communists would assign her to manual labor.If you love Chinese food, and are interested in Ms. Lo's past, it's a good book to curl up with in the evening.Compared with Ms. Lo's other books (I have four others), this is the least useful as a cookbook. I virtually never use it now that I have the Chinese Kitchen and the others.The selection of recipes is not as big as most of her other books, and I have found them to be hit or miss. In general, I've had more consistently spectacular results with her other books. One standout for me in this book is noodles with young ginger, which became a regular favorite in my household;  I never found ""young"" ginger, but it tastes delicious with regular supermarket ginger!For me, this book was my first Eileen cookbook, and it was a gateway drug. Once I tried it, I wanted more, stronger, better! If you're not (yet) highly motivated to learn authentic Chinese cooking and prefer a book that's fun to sit down and read, with a few recipes to get started just in case you do get inspired, this is a great choice. If you are already a fan of Eileen Yin-Fe Lo and think you would enjoy spending some time getting to know her Ah Paw's life and views on cooking a bit more, it's a also good choice, since it has the most personal material of any of the books.However, if you are a dedicated cook, already have several other Chinese cookbooks and are looking to expand your repertoire, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're looking just for a cookbook, buy the Chinese Kitchen or, if you already have that, Mastering the Art of Chinese Cooking or the Chinese Chicken Cookbook.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KW1D1FLP48EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557885052#wasThisHelpful","R3KW1D1FLP48EC","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was new to Sichuan peppers when I got these, and after extensive tasting and testing I determined these will not be my brand. The short version is that I got interesting but underwhelming results in three Sichuan recipes using this, but amazing stunning results with another brand readily findable in my Asian grocery.So here's the story: When I got these, I made a three Sichuan recipes with them, including the iconic and wonderful Kung Pao from Land of Plenty: A Treasury of Authentic Sichuan Cooking. So, first of all, the positive: These peppers give a strong numbing sensation which is a hallmark of Sichuan peppers, and which some say allows you to eat more hot chilis in your dish! There was also a pungent unusual flavor--also good. But then I was also detecting an unpleasant bitter aftertaste which I perceived as moldy or camphory.To figure out what was going on, I bought another kind, ""Green Bay"" brand from a local Asian grocery. With a friend, we did a side by side test, biting into each one in turn. The Green Bay had a more powerful woody citrusy flavor and I was overwhelmed..I LOVED it. This pepper had a weaker version of the positive flavor notes we liked and also an additional strong aftertaste, the same thing I was tasting in the dishes. I found it bitter and musty and intolerable. My friend described it more charitably as a 'strong cardamon,"" but still preferred the Green Bay head over heels.I then re-made the Kung Pao chicken and the difference was dramatic. My earlier attempts had been pretty good, somewhat marred by the strange aftertaste, while the version made with the Green Bay was unbelievably amazing. So that settled it...I'm tossing these and using the Green Bay. To be fair, these had sat (in a sealed bag) for four months in my pantry while the others were fresh from the Asian grocery. In theory, however, these should last two years, so I'm not going to give them a pass on the flavor. Another point in fairness: I am not a Sichuan pepper expert.Another fairness note :It is very possible that this aftertaste is actually a feature not a bug. One Web site has a quote from a chef suggesting that you can tell the difference between a good pepper and a rotten one by the bitter aftertaste; the site doesn't say clearly if it's the rotten peppers or the fresh ones that have the aftertaste.All I can say is that I'm having much better cooking results with the other brand. In terms of overall quality, these appear to be good quality peppercorns as the husks are mostly whole and empty with the bulk of the seeds removed. There are a few seeds lot of stems on the husks and in the bag, but less than in the Green Bay I bought which has a lot of seeds to remove. However, removing them isn't a big deal as most recipes call for no more than a teaspoon of these peppercorns at a time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHRQIUTAF1QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITPVV2E#wasThisHelpful","R3MHRQIUTAF1QS","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are a good product for the price.If you pay a lot more, you can get better. For example, these are softer and less crunchy--overall less fresh tasting--than Blanched Almonds from Sicily 200 Gram at more than double the price.For eating out of the bag, I would choose the more expensive ones any day and happily eat half as many. However, for baking cookies or other recipes where they may be combined with many other flavors, these will be fine. I bought these to make baked fish with almond paste from The Food of Morocco, as well as for baking cookies and making almond milk; after I've used both these and the Sicilian products in the recipes I will post on whether I taste a difference in the finished product.One comment on the ""raw"" designation. I suspect the manufacturer called these ""raw"" almonds to make clear that they aren't roasted--and they aren't. However, they can't be raw for several reasons. First, the blanching process involves immersing the almonds in boiling water, so just by definition, they can't be raw. Also, actual raw almonds are not legal in the U.S., due to government regulations aimed at protecting us from a small chance of harmful bacteria. Under U.S. law, all almond must be either cooked or fumigated--and believe it or not, after steaming or fumigating, they are still labeled raw. Helpful, huh? The packaging on this product doesn't give details on how these are processed, however, since they are not labeled organic I think it is likely they are fumigated while they still have the skins on and then blanched (or boiled in water) to remove the skins.If there is a manufacturer rep reading these reviews I would appreciate details in the comment section on this and I will update my review based on your comments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WTXPVUGP6LPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002K62BXG#wasThisHelpful","R1WTXPVUGP6LPC","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are more than twice the price of the other option for whole blanched almonds on Amazon, Raw Blanched Almonds (1 Pound Bag), and of course I was wondering if the price difference is justified.After buying both, and doing a taste test, the answer is absolutely yes!These are crunchy and fresh, with no bitter taste at all. The almond flavor is more pronounced and sweeter than that of the less expensive nuts. The biggest difference I notice is the more pronounced crunch here and overall fresher taste.If you are buying these for eating out of the package, or for a very special recipe, I would say they are worth the cost. If you are using them in a recipe with a lot of other flavors, you might be better off buying the less expensive ones, as you may not notice the difference. I will be using both kinds in recipes and will post later to say if I see a difference in particular recipes. I also suspect the fresh crunchy taste won't last, so if your plan is to use just a few and store them a long time, it may be a waste of money; if I still have any of these left in a couple months I'll post on whether the crunch lasted with the product stored in a ziploc.I have also made my own blanched almonds using fresh organic almonds from a farm. It's a simple but laborious process--drench briefly in boiling water and then peel the skins...I find my hands hurt after doing a big batch! These are comparably good to the homemade kind, but much much less work! Blanched almonds are great just for eating, or roasting and eating, or for making almond milk. You can also make almond flour for cookies, or slice and put on top of cookies. I bought these mainly to make an almond paste to stuff a sea bass in the recipe ""baked fish with almond paste"" in The Food of Morocco.The package says certified organic. That means they aren't fumigated, like nearly all non-organic almonds are even if they are labeled raw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YWL3LEPQWRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXSJ8LM#wasThisHelpful","R9YWL3LEPQWRL","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is must-have for any serious recreational cylist who wants to have fun exploring some of Massachusetts most gorgeous biking routes.I give five stars for the variety and overall awesomeness of the 40 rides in this book, but two stars for the organization and level of detail in the book.First, the positive, is that you could bike just these routes for years and be happy as a pig in s--t! Two routes that I've very much enjoyed so far are the Whitinsville Challenge, which winds through country roads, past a reservoir, on very hilly terrain, and the Tri-State Cruise, which takes you through three states, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut!This book is ideal for a fit recreational cyclist--regularly doing at least 30-50 miles on weekends and comfortable with hills. It's also great for beginner cyclists, who can test out the easiest routes--such as the North Andover Ramble, with 33 miles of gentle rolling hills-- and gradually work up to the harder ones. The easiest route in the book is the 17.4 mile Marion Ramble, a tour of the waterfront near Buzzard's Bay.Sadly, however, the level of helpfulness and detail in the book does not match the awesomeness of the routes. To be fair, it was originally published in 2007, and some if its flaws seem more pronounced now that information is available on the 'Net with a few clicks. But in any case, the book for me at least has been mostly a list of ideas, while I rely on the Web for better info on critical things--such as where to find bathrooms and better turn-by-turn directions with landmarks.PROS--Awesome routes, with a lot of variety in difficulty, terrain and scenery--Fun organization with the route name suggesting its difficulty level. A challenge is very hard, and a ramble is the easiest--mostly flat and less than 35 miles. In between there are the ""cruises."" And then there are the ""classics'--long and hard, and most people, even fit riders, will want to do them in two days.--A helpful map in the beginning showing locations of each route, so you can figure out which one(s) are feasible as an afternoon escape if you are, say, visiting your Aunt Bertha out in the boondocks of the state.--Elevation grid shown for each ride so you can see where the hills are.--A couple dozen black-and-white photos of the routes. I like the photos. Color, and more of them, would have been nice--but maybe too expensive to be practical.CONS--The route directions are really basic. They mostly appear to be computer generated with no apparent human input. They just say turn right on xxx street, left on yyy street. Few landmarks, such as turn right at the traffic light, or the donut shop etc.. There is occasionally helpful info, such as a note that there isn't a street sign at a turn, or that there's a dangerous hairpin turn. But mostly, very frustrating to follow; I spent a lot of time squinting at my iPhone when I missed turns.--Other than the map showing you where each route is located, which I found very useful, there is no other sorting provided. So if I'm looking for a challenge this coming weekend, I have to use the table of contents to find all the challenges and then go look  where they are, how long, how much climbing etc. There should be a list in each difficulty category with the distance and elevation climb summarized. I spent an hour typing out a spreadsheet of the routes, as the book is difficult to use in its current format.--Start points are described in words rather than with addresses. For example, one route says, ""Burger King on State Route 228 at the Rockland-Norwell Town Line, immediately north of state Route 3."" Okay then, but what is the address of the Burger King, so I can put it in my GPS? Even in 2007 the address of the start point would have been a basic piece of info, but today: indispensable.--Most routes don't have information on bathrooms at the start point, or on the route. The attraction of this book is to discover great biking areas far from our homes, so we will have been in the car for easily an hour or more before arriving. Bathroom info is essential!--Not enough info on convenience stores or rest stop--and the info there is isn't conveniently presented. The text description accompanying each ride does highlight places to stop, and occasionally you see a note about a convenience store in the turn-by-turn directions. But first, this should be highlighted in the summary section so you can plan your stops ahead of time at a glance. And second,  the suggestions are often not where you need the stop ie. too early/too late in the route.  Part of the problem here--and not the author's fault-- is that these are country routes and options are few. But that only makes it more important to list every single option in the remote areas, which hasn't been done.--Ride times are clearly based on the very fit, fast author and his friends. It would have been good to poll a wider range of riders on how long it takes them. The Marion Ramble, the one really easy ride for beginners is supposed to take an hour for 17 miles; sorry, but only very fit experienced cyclists do that...most people will need to leave 1.5 hours for that ride. I'm a pretty serious recreational rider and today, going with a friend who goes at a similar pace to me, we did the Whitinsville challenge in about three hours and 50 minutes, not including rest stops. The book says it's supposed to take 3 to 3.5 hours...and last year, when I was less fit, it probably took me five hours. The irony is that the super-fit riders are veterans and do not need a time range estimate--they'll simply look at the elevation grid and the mileage and they'll know how many hours to plan. Ironically, you're new enough to biking to need the time estimates to figure out how much time you need to do these routes, they probably won't apply to you; allow way more time than suggested!--The restaurant and hotel recommendations, highlighted in the summary of each ride, are so generic as to be useless--particularly in the Internet age. I really don't need to know there's a Holiday Inn nearby to stay. I can find that in a heartbeat with Google maps. I actually would like to know if there is an amazing, little-known B&B with great muffins for breakfast and a garage for bikes!--I didn't take off any stars for this because, well, the book was published in 2007. But really, it feels completely backward not to have ability to get these routes into a smartphone or a GPS. The maps are really, really small and hard to read. How about a a password protected website for people who purchase the book, with GPX files we can use for our iPhone navigation programs? If this sounds risky because people will simply share the files and cannibalize book sales, consider that awesome, easy to follow routes in gpx format are already available all over the Web for free. A lot of people are already using those instead of buying books. To compete, the next edition of this book will need to offer everything the free resources offer, and then add to it. The bar is way higher now.But yes, despite my quibbles, buy this book. Supplement the sparse directions with a GPS if you have one, or an online program. such as Ride with GPS's new iPhone app. But the great routes are worth it: You'll enjoy many hours of varied and challenging biking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4FS9TSVJEOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762739096#wasThisHelpful","R1L4FS9TSVJEOM","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes. Just YES!This is the simplest design one could imagine--just a very sturdy adjustable rubber band that holds the phone in place over a soft rubber backing. It's exactly what I would have jury-rigged if I made one myself out of what I had lying around the basement. And it's brilliant in its simplicity.To use it, you simply place it on your bicycle either vertically on the handlebar stem (my choice) or horizontally on the handlebars themselves. It's one-size-fits all so you just pull the rubber band until it's tight over your smartphone. I have an iPhone 4s with a bulky Mophie case and it fit beautifully.The downside, compared with some holders that encase the phone around the edges, is that--depending on where you place it--you may you lose up to an inch of visibility. In my case, I was able to place the rubber band on the bottom portion of my 4s below the screen and did not cover any of my screen.The advantage over other types of designs is that NOTHING (barring putting a bank vault on your handlebars to hold the phone) is more stable than a strong band of rubber with a phone held on a bed of soft rubber. And the proof, I took it today for a 15-mile ride that happens to be the very bumpiest ride I know: potholes galore, poorly placed manhole covers, a bike path with sections of giant pepples and tree roots bulging through the concrete. I bounced along happily and the phone didn't budge at...it didn't even rattle. It was part of the bicycle. (UPDATED October 5, 2014: I've had this on my bicycle for 250+ miles and it still hasn't budged.)And mind you, I am fussy. I have been looking for a handlebar smartphone mount for years, but never found one that met my standards. I spent an entire afternoon once reading all the reviews of handlebar mounts on Amazon and all over the Web, and every single one of them seemed fussy, annoying and worst of all, likely to drop your phone. Every time I saw reports of dropped phones and shattered screens, I moved on.Given the lack of options, I've been keeping my iphone in my handlebar bag--majorly suboptimal given that I navigate using GPS on the phone. I used Cyclemeter to log my rides, and whenever I wasn't sure where to go I had to unzip the bag, take out the phone and look at the map. Since Cyclemeter didn't have turn by turn directions, I needed a cue sheet anyway so having it stowed away was not a complete tragedy...it was basically a fallback for when I got lost.Well, just a few days ago Ride with GPS just came out with its awesome new app with turn by turn navigation (I'll review that separately after I have more time to test it!). Based on this sweet new technologyI became strongly motivated to get a handlebar mount. Ride with GPS recommended the Handleband, and sells it on its site, but Amazon's price was better so I bought it here.I was skeptical, at first, but after I read the reviews here I purchased and I am thrilled! The only downside I can think of is that removing it and putting it back feels a little bit fussy. It is not time consuming at all--no more than 30 seconds to remove or place it in the holder. I was a bit clumsy though, and in grasping the phone near the top to place it in, I kept turning off the phone. That was mildly annoying, but I suspect with practice this will feel easier.And a note on fit. The mount is designed to fit most bicycles. I have three--two road bikes and a hybrid--and it fit all of them just fine. The tilt mechanism is rudimentary, but for my setup worked great. It's amazing how simplest is best sometimes! When the phone is in horizontal position on the handlebars, you can (ideally before you tighten the rubber) tilt it toward or away from you to place it at the best angle for you. In the vertical position on the stem, you can only tilt it right or left (not useful!) but its only possible position happens to be at a great angle for me.If you are a person who needs an easy-in, easy-out solution for your phone while riding (for example if you may get an important phone call and need to stop and remove it quickly) this may not be your best option. However, if you're like me, using it to run a bicycle GPS app, Google maps or other navigation, you'll love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5SJMO4AUQZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FU4N4JU#wasThisHelpful","R1O5SJMO4AUQZG","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a simple little thing that makes ALL the difference in a pleasant ride. I use this for cue sheets for club rides, but you can also of course put in your own directions or a folded map.It is sturdy and nicely made. The velcro straps hold firmly to my handlebars, and the edge closure is easy to open to place items or remove them but stays firmly closed when riding.You can put it flipped as shown in the pic or if, like me, you have a small handlebar bag, you can flip it over the bag and rest it on top, which for me is the ideal position for reading cue sheets on a racing bike since I'm hunched over the handlebars.I would also like to address the reviewers who said it is too small, preventing them from including a full cue sheet for a long ride. This is a good point: For a 50 mile ride I usually need three sheets and for a 35 mile ride two; that means I have to either stop briefly to flip to the next sheet or fumble with it while riding, which is do-able but not optimal. Usually I follow other riders until I have a moment to do it safely.From my perspective, this is a small inconvenience and SO worth it to have a manageablely sized rather than humongous item on my handlebars. A map holder twice this size would interfere with my hand posiiton and maybe even obstruct my view of the road. However, everyone's bike set up and preferences is different, so I definitely would suggest buying the largest cover which doesn't interfere with your riding. You can quickly figure out what size works for you by cutting out a piece of cardboard and using a butterfly clip to attach it temporarily to your handlebars. Take a ride around the block and you'll quickly know if you like the size or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343OZ9TNP6AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AP0ACI#wasThisHelpful","R343OZ9TNP6AV","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this food because it is grain-free and very high quality meat. Cats, as obligate carnivores, don't need grain, and in fact--if you give them something with a lot of carbs, they will continue eating until they have enough protein.Since I switched my cats a few years back to this brand, both lost weight even though I feed them as much of this as they will eat. It completely transformed one of my cats. He was dumpy, overweight and middle-aged and since the food transition he lost weight and has become more active. His fur looks amazing! I also recommended this food to a friend, forgot I made the recommendation and six months later was over his house and said, wow, your cat looks amazing! He said, yeah, it's the food change we talked about.That said, the Wellness line is not my cat's favorite by any means. The reason is that it's like switching a person from potato chips and McDonald's to good healthy food. The supermarket brands such as Fancy Feast are filled with rendered fat, which smells great and makes cats go crazy. This has none of this, so they miss it. I transitioned VERY slowly, mixing the food they liked with a small amount of this and gradually increasing the proportion over months.Now, years later, my cat eats this with gusto--though, of course, if I brought Fancy Feast back he would go nuts again for that, but I don't. This is is his second favorite flavor after this one: Wellness Canned Cat Food, Chicken and Herring Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans.The nice thing about this food is that, while he now eats it with apparent pleasure, my cat never overeats. I can give him as much as he wants/asks for and he stays the same weight. I'd say he eats an average of a half 12-ounce can a day, but it varies--some days he eats almost a full can, other days less than half. So essentially he self regulates, whereas with the kitty crack and dried food, full of grain, he overate.These large cans must be opened with a can opener. I buy them because they are a better value economically--the small cans of this brand are way expensive. Even this is expensive per ounce,, but if you actually do a calculation of dollars paid per protein this one stacks up just fine to the less expensive brands.  Which means my cat gets the nutrition he needs in fewer ounces. Any wet food is more expensive than dried food, but based on my cat's consumption, feeding Wellness is not significantly more expensive than feeding mass-market wet food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOCJNFU4SZMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008CQVA#wasThisHelpful","R2GOCJNFU4SZMQ","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I saw this product was made with all natural materials, it sounded like a win! It looked like rope, and wood.Not exactly. When it arrived, not only did I notice that the rungs are held together with glue, it was poorly applied--resulting in visible glue spots on many of the rungs--one of them the size of a quarter.That in itself might have been okay.  But then I noticed that several of the rungs were completely loose, sliding up and down on the rope. I gently pushed one that seemed solid, and it, too, moved.Rather than return it, I fixed it by taking it apart and using another (longer) piece of rope. I placed a knot under and above each rung.

"I bought this with the idea of putting it on the pullout keypad shelf to make using my laptop more ergonomic. The big advantage of this keyboard was it was the only Mac-specific one I could find that has a trackpad on the keyboard. The Mac bluetooth keyboard (which is nicely built) has no built-in trackpad so must be used with an external mouse or trackpad.I really really wanted a built-in trackpad since I find it more convenient...I hate taking my hand off the keyboard all the way to the right every time I have to do something. For people who prefer external trackpads or mice (which are probably the majority), I heartily recommend you skip this product and buy a nice keyboard, either the official mac one or another. Practically anything will be better than this one.The picture looked sleek and nice, and I clicked ""buy"" before reading the reviews. Big mistake. When I took it out of the box, I was immediately disappointed. The plastic is cheap and lightweight. Two AAA batteries needed, not included. Eager to use it, I ran to the kitchen and took some out of the baking scale.Bluetooth setup with my Macbook Pro took seconds and worked flawlessly, so I stayed optimistic. But typing on this thing was like driving a plastic car on the highway....rattle, rattle, rattle. For full disclosure, I type 100 wpm and expect a keyboard to perform. But this didn't even come close and I wouldn't recommend it even to someone with lower standards. The keys are spongy and annoying and slow and every stroke reminded you that you were typing on a cheap piece of plastic.But the real dealbreaker is the trackpad, which after all is a main reason to consider this over the Mac version. It is jumpy and uses 1990 technology . While it's billed as a Mac keyboard it doesn't include any of the keypad functions, such as scroll up and down or swipe, of the modern OS. I can't even tap to click--you have to use the hard keys, which require a very firm press which takes time and effort. I really tried for an hour to make myself use this keyboard, but every time I needed a mouse action, my hand kept flying to the laptop high on the desk--defeating the purpose of having a separate, lower keyboard!And the straw that broke the camel's back? The 'a' key didn't work at least half the time. nd truly, tht is nnoying.Above, I mentioned that batteries are not included. Which brings me to this: If you use your keyboard a lot, I would expect you are going to be constantly replacing these batteries. This is not good design. Unlike the official Mac wireless keyboard, this one  won't turn off automatically when not in use...you have to remember to flip the switch. People buying external keyboards often want them for ergonomic reasons, which means they are using them a LOT.So, when panning a product I try to suggest alternatives. If you are looking for a media-server keyboard, consider this tiny little beauty: FAVI Entertainment Mini Wireless Keyboard with Mouse Touchpad and Laser Pointer (FE01-GR) - Green. I also will be checking out the Logitech diNovo Edge Keyboard (Black)Logitech, which has been discontinued but they are still selling the stock. This is not a Mac specific keyboard, but it can be used with Mac as long as you are willing to take the time to figure out the corresponding keys for the Mac-specific functions. I have one I used for years as for my media server, and I liked the rechargeability--just plop it in the stand when done and no batteries needed. I never had the issues of the battery dying prematurely (mine lasted five years) posted in other reviews. However, I've never used it as an external keyboard for Macbook, so after I do I will post a review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L27A77AOF83G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045JFU4I#wasThisHelpful","R2L27A77AOF83G","A11ZCZ874OORU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ZCZ874OORU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This grinder does a great job grinding for the price. I have owned two of them.First, the grinding is decent--pretty even, and the adjustability works well. I also like that it dumps the coffee into a little drawer so you don't have to unscrew anything to get it.What I dislike is that little timer dial you use to start it running is not attached. It comes off regularly, and the result is I'm always rooting around the counter for it. I don't understand why they didn't attach this part securely.The third thing I dislike is that you can't program it to grind a set amount of coffee. You can guesstimate with the timer dial but it's really inaccurate so I always overground or underground. Overgrinding resulted in stale grounds in my basket overnight (defeating the purpose of grinding mself) and undergrinding means I have to turn the timer again...likely meaning I'll end up overgriding.Anyway, my last issue with the Baratza is that, at least in my hands, I owned two and each lasted only 2 or 3 years each time. I did not clean it often, so it is possible it is partly  my fault.In terms of what to buy instead: I couldn't find anything else that looked promising in this price range. A friend has a Breville she loves which does a nice job of dosing--but hers is from 2011 and I see recent reviews show quality issues with the newer models. I ended up splurging and buying a Mazzer Mini--very expensive but I hope it will last much longer than this.NOTE: At least one review says Baratza has since changed the annoying knob design.

"to cope with a significant handicap when you are becoming a young adult, but it is even worse when it was caused by someone you loved, who dies (Parker's mother) causing your blindness, throwing you into a world of sightlessness -- then losing your father... then having to move in with cousins and aunts, uncles, not all of whom you find particularly endearing.But what does Parker Grant do? She SURVIVES with a toughness and practicality, creating her own world, hugging herself tightly to her soul and determination  -- and yes like any young teenager, worrying about her image as a person (not as a blind person), learning about love and loss, friendship and how to cope with people who only want to get in your way and cause trouble.It's hard enough trying to navigate your world as a sighted person when you are young and about to inherit the world and adulthood -- Parker takes this with determination, sometimes anger (which fuels her strength) and always it seems, with a muted hope and general faith that she WILL get what she wants -- how, she sometimes does not know, but she appears to have high hopes for herself, and will not take no for an answer.My favorite part of this book are the running sequences. She is free, she flies like the wind, she ooops-- bumps into things, she is headstrong and she thrives on all of this.Surely this is a book that inspires, that alerts young teens to the fact that people who are ""different"" are really much more like them than they realize. Hopefully this book will create empathy where there sometimes is none, and challenge and give hope to those in Parker's age group, who are trying to navigate a world that has placed physical roadblocks in their way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK892HXRAROF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316259853#wasThisHelpful","RK892HXRAROF3","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenox quality is something I have come to expect naturally --  and I have NEVER been disappointed. Lenox takes a theme and turns it into a soothing balm that can help to override the daily problems one faces. No matter what the theme is-- cats, dogs, angels, cute tchotchkies, religious themes, they are approached with dignity, flawless construction, sometimes humor, and always the Lenox QUALITY we have come to know and love.The porcelain is constructed in such a way that it brings a muted dignity to the flowing forms, and reflects ambient light in a way that flatters the folds of the garments and the faces of each figure.This Holy Family Nativity set is no exception. It speaks of quietude and reverence even if it is just placed somewhere and left unlit. However, the lighting brings a special ""life"" to these images, reminding me of warm flickering candles in the old time churches I would visit as a little kid with my Italian Nonna, and the way the lights brought to life the legends and stories behind the saintly images and statues there.Although the price of this set may be high to some, this will be a cherished heirloom that will last for ages, if properly cared for.I know this set will light my way to Christmas this year, and I certainly know that I will keep this set up in a special place, long after Christmas is over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR63AIQOY6O2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP1Z4OW#wasThisHelpful","RR63AIQOY6O2S","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VERY Rich is the subject matter of this book. Consisting of twelve essays by theologians concerning the proceedings of the Los Angeles Theology Conference of January 2015, ""Locating Atonement"" is not  a book to read once and put down-- neither is it a book that one can skim over. Every single thought, word, phrase, has a centralized meaning relating to the original theme of Atonement, and this book is basically a guide, a reference, a deep delving into religion, wisdom, realism, hope, interpretations, of the meaning of Atonement in, by and from God, The Trinity (and there are some beautiful interpretations of the Triune God here!), and The Word Made Flesh. And of course, every single author brings a new, fresh interpretation which is sometimes at variance with what other authors in this book have put forward as a basis of argument or interpretation.Of particular interest to me at the moment (as I am about 1/3 though this book, where every word matters) is Benjamin Myers chapter on ""The Patristic Model"", with its ""implied metaphysical assumptions"".I give this book 5 stars, but I give the typeface and the color of the paper stock 2 stars, as the (11 point?) thin typeface looks to be dark grey, which does not stand out on the ecru colored pages. This is bad, considering the fact that every single word in this exceptional book really must be read fully in order to gain the richness of the dialogues within.

"Once again I'll say it -- this book is PRECIOUS -- it is an OmniReligious (well...... within the Christian Faith) expression of viewpoints, experiences, opinions -- short (3 or 4 pages) absorbing articles touching upon the questions that Jesus asked of his followers. The authors, all Christian spiritual leaders, open a vista to the reader, who can also pose his/her own questions, solutions or observations concerning the questions Jesus asked his followers.My favorite one was by Spencer Reese ""Woman, why do you involve me"" -- was  eye-opening, touching, even in some instances, humorous -- but I almost cried reading his essay.I cannot read through ""What Did Jesus Ask?"" without wanting to pick up this book and read it again. The essays are rich and thought-provoking, comforting, inspirational.In the very back of this book is a Biblical Reference Guide, with the actual questions themselves and a short description of the context in which they were asked.I have a question myself-- why were there no essays by Non Christian religious leaders? Surely everyone knows something about these questions that Jesus asked, and Non Christian leaders most certainly would have their own ""take"" on them. We know Jesus was not talking to one specific religious group when He was on Earth, asking these questions. I would have loved to have read the opinions of Non Christian religious leaders.This book would be a great addition to a weekly/monthly religious book group.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0F9DQO5C00N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618930583#wasThisHelpful","R3N0F9DQO5C00N","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started to read this book, it induced some flashbacks that had been semi-buried in my past. Me, Mom Sylvia and Sis, striding down the rain soaked bridge over the Schuylkill river in Philadelphia in 1962, on our way to the annual Notre Dame Navy game. Poor Mom took a face-plant on that bridge but undaunted she sallied forth and we had a great day at the stadium despite the torrential rain. Dad was not a sports fanatic, Mom was rabid about ND and we'd religiously attend the ND/Navy games, watching the other ND games on TV. While celebrating one last-minute victory, we cheered so hard we broke the springs under the couch, Dad was totally mystified.Mom would have been 95 this year but cancer took her away before she reached 72. She loved Notre Dame football until she could not see the TV screen anymore, And our days of going to the Notre Dame games were long long over. So it is a real breath of fresh air to read about this 95 yr old man with fresh memories, an ebullient attitude towards life and football, and the gift that one son gave this man, his father (and vice versa) -- the ability to once again attend the games of their beloved Ole Miss, share hot dogs, corn dogs, camaraderie and memories.Reading this book was an exercise in Joy. Fresh wit, dry humor, and thoughtful introspection -- mixed  in with great anecdotes, history and lore. Stuart Stevens recants highlights of past games, his boyhood impressions and experiences, and the general attitude of the people he and his father meet while at these stadiums-- the mantra ""Hotty Toddy"" shared by strangers and old friends alike, the deeper thoughts about racial attitudes in the olden days, the riots, the early days of desegregation, and the time when all-white teams were suddenly being supplanted by exceptional black athletes, and the history and impact of segregation in that area and era. The Last Season reads in a friendly familiar matter like a late autumn walk through a sun warmed campus, and the heart beats faster, and one's ears almost perk up when Stevens describes the unmistakable beat of marching band music filling the air long before the stadium comes into view.The Last Season is a riveting narrative of an exceptional bond between father, son and the football team they have loved forever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLXSULICDVTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353022#wasThisHelpful","RQLXSULICDVTF","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike some of those transparent gloves you can buy in the supermarket or hardware store, these nice blue X3 Extreme gloves are form fitting, swaddling your hand and fingers in latex -- enabling one to be dexterous (pick up coins and smaller objects) and forming a thick protective barrier when working with dirt and liquids. I can put lotion on my hands and then put these gloves on without worrying that (as has happened with other, thinner gloves) about resistance, or the bottom band on the cuff ripping off. These gloves glide on. I can reuse them as well, the next day, or the next time I need them as they do not seem to stick together and fossilize as some of their competition does.They are note powdered inside which is great, as the powder tends to dry up the skin on my fingers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWFP43URX4RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00466M3TU#wasThisHelpful","R1XWFP43URX4RT","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I click the button every day just to see those lights (LOL)-- a very practical idea however!!!The Cons:The first time I used it the (very nice idea, and it's a lot better than my using a Post-It) flap that covers the spout went flying off backwards.Ditto for the filter cover flap with usage/replacement indicator.BOTH are now secured with tape-- they still flap but they don't launch themselves into the dish drainer anymore.The black plastic sleeve inside the pitcher at the top half - doesn't that come off for cleaning? I tried and it seems to be stuck there as part of the design. You KNOW mildew is going to love growing between that sleeve and the inside of the pitcher.

"Emma and Isaac are at odds with each other, Isaac, seemingly enjoying his rumschpringe, may not be the man Emma (who can sometimes be quite headstrong herself)  wants to marry after all although her heart and emotions are still very much involved with him. Isaac on the other hand is standoffish, loud and sometimes rude to her.. Emma does have her community to fall back on, which includes the sisterly love of her friends that she works with, and her family as well. Isaac is torn between the English world and the community he grew up in. But neither he nor Emma will give way to one another, and the tension builds.We follow Emma and Isaac, their families and friends, through good times and tragedies. The Amish community is, as always, close knit as this book illustrates, with one individual pitching in to help another, whether they be family or friend or co worker, but Isaac seems to be keeping a secret from Emma and her heart only breaks even more.When Isaac, who is actually more responsible than Emma believes him to be,  makes his final decision, the Bishop does not make it any easier for him. Neither does Emma, who thinks she knows Isaac's ""secret"", and is miserable because of what she believes to be true. Will love conquer all? Or will a good thorough soul-searching conversation pave the way to reconciliation?""Crossroads"", as in other Barbara Cameron's books with an Amish theme, conjures up the warmth of family and friends in the Amish community. It is a friendly book to read, as it takes the reader into a world that most of us know very little about. The glossary in the back defines the Amish words and phrases found sprinkled liberally through these pages,, and as before in her other books, contains several pages of Amish recipes.An enjoyable read, nothing unexpected as per the plot, but a nice foray through the life of an Amish young lady,, the man she loves, and their close-knot community","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS67XI17KEPMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426740603#wasThisHelpful","RS67XI17KEPMV","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Purple jacket, purple text, purple illustrations -- fabulous!! I just happen to carry a small purple duffel so this book looked great inside and outside of the bag.I think every page of this book was spellbinding, fun to read, and engrossing, The ""teasers"" and illustrations at the end of each chapter added to the suspense and the mystery.Of the characters Libby and May, May was the more believable one, She was serious, adventurous, fun loving and pragmatic. Also a little ""dizzy"" - when your laptop battery runs out all you need to do is recharge it.....When May found the Princess X stickers, the book took on more substance and suspense.

I also enjoyed the very ricj descriptions of local stores, as well as the rotting underground that the four sleuths raced through in order to reach their objective and elude a killer/.There is action galore in this book, which I found very hard to put down, This is not a book you skim over, as you will lose precious details if you do.No romance, which was great, as each character was a unique person who added to the depth of the plot and the action.And for those who may think 15 an 16 is too young to unravel subtle clues or think up new ways of solving riddles, that of course is not true, Sis and I at the tender age of 10 and 11 as well as several of our schoolmates,had our own super sleuthing club, with meetings - we fancied ourselves young detectives making our neighborhood safer..The ending of this book, the culmination of sleuthing, running, hiding and unraveling the mystery, is","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QTYWQ8DF9LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545620856#wasThisHelpful","R4QTYWQ8DF9LF","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I pulled out a very lovely white bottle with a beautifully designed label- excellent camouflage for an item that helps dispel unruly personal aromas!!!!! Come to think of it-- maybe even helpful in detoxifying the odors from the NEXT stall(s) over!!So... even before I skipped to the Loo, I sprayed one little test spray (""White Flowers and Citrus"" scent)  into the air-- my fellow employees told me they could still smell it hours later. But now to the REAL test of this Toilet Spray's Prowess -- Once in the confines of the employee's rest room, I sprayed as directed and immediately had a sneezing fit -- Which, in thinking back on it-- was quite efficacious in assisting the job at hand.OK-- so I'm a bit allergic to it? Maybe in confined spaces only. As it was -- PooPourri REALLY masked any offensive odors that had the temerity to occupy the loo at the same time I did.I will try it at home.

"When I first took this doll out of its shipping box I thought the doll's box had been smashed in transit. Not so -- it is a skewed, almost triangular-but-square box-- which makes it hard for little hands to open and close should they want to put Lonnie back into her box (which has a pretty interior). The next problem was those wormy little barely-expandable elastic ties that securely held her very very securely in place. I almost cut her neck trying to remove them but once done she emerged, beautiful and radiant, in an attitude (if dolls can have attitudes) that almost says ""Here I am and isn't this FUN!!?"" . She is VERY fashionable -- and her long flowing HAIR is sliky and gorgeous!! Her face, her elegantly posed hands, her posable joints, all add to her top notch looks and appeal. The purse is hard to open and there is a little surprise inside that can easily get lost. Her dress is nicely made, with removable apron as well -- her accessories are tiny and if taken off, can get lost, and of course are way too small for little kids below the age of 5 (or 6) to safely play with.I would have liked it if the inner box had some little detents/storage cut-outs where her accessories and her purse can be placed after being played with. I would also have liked it if there was a QR code printed on the side or front of the box that would play a few frames from the Mulan film-- I doubt many of these little girls who now own this beautiful doll know much about Mulan at all.

This is what We;;ness Divine Duo has:Natural, grain free wet cat food recipe• 3 delicious cat food flavor combination varieties, including Beef Pté & Diced Chicken Liver, Chicken Pâté & Diced Turkey and Chicken Pâté & Diced Duck• Wet cat food with two layers and textures: savory pâté topped with tender cuts in gravy• Wet cat food comes in convenient, clean plastic can with easy-peel lid• Healthy cat food with no wheat, grain, corn, soy or artificial flavors, colors or preservatives*** NO grain, no artificial flavors or colors or preservatives. *** Wellness ROCKS!!Cee Cee LOOOVES this and I am SO HAPPY!! I opened the first cup (please recycle the plastic) and was greeted by a smooooth Pate with chunks of meat and carrots in a juicy gravy. Now Cee Cee is a 14/15 YO kitty with some significant health problems, so getting her to eat is sometimes a chore (""Here kitteh! Have this? oh... well, have THIS!! uh oh...hmmmm...then....try this????"") and I am so happy she LIKES this!!Knowing that chunks of cat food have sometimes been the bane of Cee Cee's after dinner adventures, I took the fork and squished the chinks and the carrots so they would go down and stay down when she ate them -- BUT the chunks are really soft and I probably should have just left them as they were.If this kitty gains weight from eating this tasty great smelling food, I will be OVERJOYED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIY5HG72BP51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4GLVJM#wasThisHelpful","R1GIY5HG72BP51","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes this is a nice cotton blanket with a heavy feel to it and more warmth than I would expect from a cotton blanket. The weave is nice, it is generously sized BUT when I unfolded it from its reusable zippered plastic carrying case (with a nice handle), placed it on the bed and sleepily slid under the sheets, I turned to my cat (who was reclining sweetly on the other pillow) and said ""Did you DO Something???!!!""No she hadn't-- it was the smell of the blanket.

"When I first get a new dry cat food, I...taste test it. Why? SO I know what my cat is tasting -- although I'm sure her taste buds are better than mine. Anyway -- this Nutro High Protein Adult Food has a pleasant aroma and taste-- is crunchy without being a tooth-breaker. It has chicken -- it has pea protein and I swear I could taste the peas -- so I wondered- ""will Cee Cee like this?""She dove into her dish and snarfed it down-- I was SO happy -- Cee Cee, being elderly and frail, has become VERY picky about her foodies, both canned and dry -- and has lost significant weight from shunning some of her food (the vet and I are on this - last exam was in late July) so seeing her eat this made BOTH of us happy.The actual list of ingredients appear to be natural, and well-thought-out -- the combo of Chicken and Salmon bring proteins and oils into the mix.  I will update this when the bag is down to half its contents. BTW the innovative zip-opening is very handy to use-- it is pourable-- but I just stick my hand in and grab enough to plop into her dish, then I zip up the bag (it takes a little getting used to but when zipped it's closed securely)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252NUAAIZEE2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3QFE#wasThisHelpful","R252NUAAIZEE2S","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These rough and tumble wipes are about the size of your usual shop ""paper towel"". They come in an industrial-type dispenser box of 125, and they feel rough and tough and do a good job cleaning up ""stuff"". Wet them and ball them up and add scouring powder or soap and they get at the dirt or spills, and usually can be used again at least once more time.

"Squid Ink. Blackened dinner pot. Scary diagnosis. Tenacity, hope, inventiveness, fear and fortitude. Friends who get over the initial shock ""Why didn't you tell us?"" and a Haiku endSeventeen year old Sora lives in an increasingly final world-- the walls and life slowly closing in on him-- a kid in love with sports until his legs start to fail him -- then given just a few years to live, with ALS. He sports a  fatalistic but optimistic air and continues to stay in touch with classmates, even though his world is now his home, his computer and his beloved grandparents. Living with his mother, in a humble apartment in Japan, treated with love and joy by his grandparents in the country, although worried about his slow descent into immobility, he is determined to stay connected with the outside world even as his disease progresses and his friends grow scarce. And  so he begins to live on line. He is Samurai Man (""Farm when it's sunny, read when it rains""). trying to keep a lid on his fears while continuing to reach out to friends, new and old, on line.I found the writing introspective, dark, humorous, hopeful -- a typical 17 yr old kid chatting with his friends and classmates on line. I found his new friends Mai and Kaito believable -- including their initial shock and reaction. I liked Mai's "" you better not be some fat creepy dude. I'm giving my friend your address before I come"". Humorous, true-to-life.And why not an instant friendship? Kaito and Mai have a ""reaction"" at first but think about it and reach out as friends to Sora, not as people who feel sorry for him. Do they understand what Sora is going through inside? It appears they do, a little.Meanwhile Sora, who ""willed the universe to have rest me in my sleep"" understands that he will soon become immobile--an active mind trapped in his body. He resolves to take care of that before it's too late, and his reaction to his last day with his unknowing mother is profound and moving.  Kaito and Mai are there for him. The ""dreaming tree"" that Mai creates is like the tree of Eden in reverse. A goodbye to suffering and a hello to Eden.And like any good book, a thousand questions, like the one thousand cranes, remain unanswered, as it should be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3FF8VOJWP1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481430653#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3FF8VOJWP1Q","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is fun, for a one-sided lazy day game of table tennis . First of all, it is very nice looking, sleek, with a see thru design.. Stick 4 AA's in it (their weight helps to ground the base) load it up with ping pong balls (4 yellow ones for $2.99 at my local super market) and wait for the first one. Pop! Out it comes! The iPong Mini Portable Solo Table Tennis Server...  serves at a regular speed, no smashing line drives, so the direction is predictable, and each hit is the final one for that particular ball, but it's fun. After using up all the balls (30, of which I only have about 16) you have to go pick them up unless you jerry-rig something that will collect them after you hit them). Sis and I used to play a mad game at the kitchen table, balls all over the place at dizzying speeds until Grandma had to yell at us so she could set the table. This Table Tennis server is one speed, one lob only. For the price, it's ok. For the fun factor it is also good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RRV14ULIZ79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQWTQTA#wasThisHelpful","R36RRV14ULIZ79","A1HRYC60VTMYC0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HRYC60VTMYC0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"William Guarnere and Edward Heffron are better known as ""Wild Bill"" and ""Babe"" from the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company.  We first met them in Steven Ambrose's Band of Brothers and then saw them portrayed in the movie of the same name.  This book tells their life stories, beginning in the neighborhoods of Philadelphia, coming together in the chaos of WWII Europe, and continuing together as close friends back home.These two friends offer perspective on some of the events in Band of Brothers, but most of the stories are uniquely theirs.  They include:- A girl chasing a departing troop train with suitcase in hand to catch up with her soldier--who she will never see again.- Two soldiers filling jerry cans with water for their thirsty platoon and noticing human brains in the stream and water.  There was no time to get water anywhere else.- How far soldiers were willing to go to get rid of an officer they believed would get them killed on the battlefield.- How American soldiers and officers fought and what they thought of their French and British allies.- The common procedure for accepting the surrender of members of the German Gestapo.These soldiers' stories have the same tone and repeat many of the same lessons about war that their fellow soldiers in Easy Company have shared.  Soldiers did their jobs in all weather, without proper equipment, support, or ammunition.  Often they fought out of loyalty and concern for the men around them as much as they did for their country.  And when one of their comrades-in-arms died it affected them deeply and forever after.This is a well-written memoir and is enhanced by the back-and-forth narrative between the two old soldiers.  Readers will forgive them for bragging a little when interviewed by their female coauthor.

The stories are divided into three sections:  The Law, The Heart, and The Law & the Heart.The stories in The Law section didn't capture my interest.  The author is an attorney and writes from experience.  He obviously knows the law and has found a few odd corners to look around.  He also seems to think like a lawyer, in a structured and ordered way.  Some of these stories even take the form of legal documents, which describe by implication a state of affairs in the world.  This is skillfully done.  I think my problem stems from the fact that I work in a building full of lawyers and don't enjoy being reminded of their presence.  A group of these stories together has a similar effect.  I believe I would enjoy them more if they were spaced across several anthologies along with stories from other authors.  (I have a similar reaction to Robert Reed's Greatship stories--best taken in moderation.)The stories in the last two sections had a different effect.  They convinced me that the author writes with greater sensitivity and nuance than evidenced by The Law stories.  My three favorites are from these sections.  I'll say a little about each:""The Orpheus Fountain"" is a moving exploration of what it means to be close to someone.  It is hard to believe the author's claim that it began as a response to a writing exercise.  If you have ever lost someone you love, or lost the love of someone, it will touch you.  It belongs in one of the Best of the Year collections.In ""Hear the Enemy, My Daughter"" the main character strives to understand an alien race which is at war with humans.  Key to understanding the alien Sheshash is puzzling out the relationship between their two-member fighting pairs.  One is a three-meter giant and the other is a half-meter dwarf.  They fight with incredible coordination and recklessness.  Understanding is possible, but comes at a cost.""Tenure Track"" is another story constructed out of documents.  Although I grew a little weary of this format while reading The Law stories, it really works here.  A set of letters and receipts traces the lives of a husband and wife.  One receives a medical treatment to greatly prolong life.  The other is unable to benefit from the effects of the treatment.  And their lives go on.I enjoyed this collection, in spite of my original impression.  I suspect that attorneys or attorney aficionados will enjoy it more.  The later stories should be accessible to and appreciated by a wider audience.  And, of course, ""The Orpheus Fountain"" is a gem._____*Disclosure:  The publisher offered me a free Kindle version of the book with the understanding that I would write a review after reading it.  There was no attempt to sway my opinion or request that my review be favorable.  I have no other connection with the publisher or the author.  My opinion is my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AN0HNGDU80WW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9SFLQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3AN0HNGDU80WW","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"W. Craig Reed presents a series of linked stories from the experiences of submariners (including himself and his father) who served in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Some of these accounts are told for the first time because participants have been released from their long-term commitments to keep them secret.  Others are made possible because of declassified records made available by security personnel from the former Soviet Union.The book's stories include:- How American technicians invented new technology to locate Soviet subs after their adversaries switched to ""burst"" radio transmissions.- How close some sub commanders came to launching torpedoes at enemy ships during the Cuban missile crisis--and starting a war between the superpowers.- The role that a military family's pet bear played in advancing submarine detection technology.- How a U.S. sub installed and maintained a tap on an underwater Soviet military communications cable.- The Soviet espionage that allowed decryption of U.S. communication codes.The book achieves a balance between technical detail and good storytelling.  Readers are taught enough about sonar, radar, and other technologies to understand the relative advantages of U.S. and Soviet systems at different stages of the Cold War.  Reconstructed dialogue produces a sense of in-the-moment urgency in encounters between ships and subs from opposing navies.  The author is careful to distinguish fact from speculation when investigating the final hours of several subs that did not return from their missions.Reed's book is informative, entertaining, and intriguing.  Anyone who enjoys a good military or espionage thriller should find it rewarding.  Of course, it will be particularly rewarding to those who like sub stories, such as Tom Clancy's The Hunt for Red October and sub histories, such as Peter Padfield's War Beneath The Sea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BMEQYVEUN45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H4I4JA#wasThisHelpful","R15BMEQYVEUN45","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's been such a fuss about the iPad mini cover ever since it was released.  The magnetic latch that snaps so easily into place is very cool, as is the feature that activates/deactivates the iPad mini whenever the cover is opened or closed.  And the cover folds nicely into a stand for those who use their iPad minis in landscape orientation.  But there was nothing for people like myself who like to use them in portrait orientation.Until I found this case.  It fits easily onto the iPad mini and I can finally use it on my desk at almost any angle.  The multi-position stand mounted on the rotating platform on the back of the case creates lots of angles to choose from, in both portrait and landscape orientations.  And the case is sufficiently stable that clicking, typing, and general poking on the screen doesn't jar it.  Oh, and you can fit the original, award-winning iPad mini cover on along with this case.  The best of both worlds.The only--very minor--drawback is a slight tendency for part of the rubber border around the edges to slip off.  But this only happens to small sections of it.  Not enough for the case to come off.If you have an iPhone 5 check out the ZeroChroma case for the iPhone 5, which is pretty much the same thing, only smaller.

"Author Ben Shapiro thinks that Liberals fight dirty.  ""Calling you a racist and sexist, a bigot and a homophobe, gives them a sense of satisfaction with their status in the universe.  The left no longer makes arguments about policies' effectiveness.  Their only argument is character assassination.""Shapiro suggests that Conservatives fight back using similar tactics.  The ""eleven rules for debating a leftist"" he advocates are:1.  Walk toward the fire.2. Hit first.3. Frame your opponent.4. Frame the debate.5. Spot inconsistencies in the Left's arguments.6. Force Leftists to answer questions.7. Do not get distracted.8. You don't have to defend people on your side.9. If you don't know something, admit it.10. Let the other side have meaningless victories.11. Body language matters.Most of Shapiro's suggested tactics match the assumption that ""debating the Left"" involves battling a hostile and malicious opponent.  But not all.  Some are also appropriate to sincere debate about the issues.Readers should repeatedly evaluate the nature of the specific discussion they are engaged in and take the highest road that seems appropriate.  The suggested approach may well be appropriate for a public confrontation with an unpleasant and scheming Piers Morgan.  It shouldn't be a starting point in a friendly car pool conversation.  It's important to remember the difference.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0GM52SQXDJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRJQ7Z2#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0GM52SQXDJS","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a partial biography of Edward Forbes Smiley III, a collector, forger, and thief of rare maps.  Smiley originally met with author Michael Blanding and agreed to tell his story.  Once interviews began, Smiley backed away from the project.  The author warned him that the work had gone too far to be abandoned and that the book would be finished with or without his assistance.  Smiley disappeared and refused to meet with the author again.And the book was finished.  It tells a somewhat distanced tale of Smiley's legitimate work building collections of historically significant maps.  And it reconstructs his shadier enterprises.  Along the way, readers learn about various maps and mapmakers, both famous and obscure.  The narrative is a painless combination of modern crime thriller and excerpts from the historical record.Although pleasant reading, the account suffers noticeably from Smiley's decision to withdraw from collaboration with the author.  Speculations about his reasons for doing so and his unconfirmed criminal activities lack the credibility and descriptive detail Smiley would have supplied.  Expansion of the historical information is a reasonable filler strategy, but also feels like one.  The result feels like the product of an author making the best of a bad situation.Your mileage may vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QWNXRI3B6G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6LNU#wasThisHelpful","R6QWNXRI3B6G9","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Flynn's science fiction novel has three primary subplots.  The first is based on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a nineteenth-century design for a mechanical computer which was never built.  In this story, the engine was built and allowed development of modern programming methods a century earlier.  The second subplot derives from the fact that the developers of this steampunk computer keep its existence secret.  This group develops the science of cliology (much like Hari Seldon's psychohistory), which enables them to make accurate predictions about future trends and events.  They use this capability to influence social and political developments, and, of course, to make profitable business investments.The third and primary subplot begins in the present when Sara Beaumont discovers, first a hidden cache of Babbage computers, then a collection and research records written by cliologists.  Soon afterward the friends she confided in are killed, a faction of the secret society makes contact with her, and she goes into hiding under a false identity.  It becomes apparent that there are several hidden groups observing and manipulating world events, each with competing agendas.  Sara must decide who to trust and what to believe.There are innovative ideas in this book, particularly considering how long ago it was written.  While the narrative is fast-paced and entertaining, the story falls short of its full potential.  I understand that there is not real science behind most of the invented technologies of science fiction.  But part of the genre's appeal is a certain amount of well-executed hand-waving about how it all works that stays just within the bounds of plausibility.  This story would have been better with more invented information about Babbage computers and about the strengths and limitations of cliological prediction.  It seems almost wasteful to introduce both ideas, and then devote most of the attention to the efforts of various secret groups to exterminate each other.That said, the book was enjoyable and worth reading.  However, it will be more to those who enjoy action thrillers than it will to fans of hard science fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQPHG1IN9HL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MYFULE#wasThisHelpful","RJQPHG1IN9HL9","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Olsson is one of the world's top forensic linguists.  He has testified in more than 500 court cases, published numerous research studies, and co-authored (with June Luchjenbroers) one of the field's leading textbooks, Forensic Linguistics.  In this book he teaches readers about forensic linguistics using the case study method.Each of the twenty-three chapters describes a case the author has contributed to as a forensic linguist.  He has selected each one to illustrate particular aspects of his work.  ""My aim is not primarily to tell a good story, but to illustrate how interesting and complex language is, and how powerful a resource it can be when it enters the arena of the law.""  All of the cases are worth reading.  These three are reasonably representative:Chapter 4, ""Is The Da Vinci Code a Plagiarism?"" examines an accusation that Dan Brown ""borrowed without permission"" major plot elements of his bestseller from another writer's book.  Olsson addresses this question by examining the order in which the plot elements occur in each book.  He also looks at instances where both authors made the same unusual or erroneous word choices.  Olsson reports the legal outcome and invites readers to form their own conclusions.In Chapter 8, ""Murder or Suicide,"" Olsson is hired by the family of a young man who has apparently committed suicide and left a suicide note for his family.  Suspicious circumstances lead his family suspect the man was murdered and the note forged by the killer.  In reaching his conclusions, Olsson considers both characteristic features of the young man's writing and the tone and content typical of authentic suicide notes.Chapter 20, ""Return to Sender,"" occurs in the context of a woman's claim that she was sexually assaulted by her psychotherapist.  As this trial approached the city's Social Welfare Division received an anonymous letter asserting that the woman suffered from several specific psychological disorders and was unfit to care for her children.  Olsson's analysis addressed the scarcity of psychology terminology in everyday language and included a word choice comparison between the letter and the therapist's patient notes.Each chapter tells an engaging story and showcases at least one linguistic analysis technique.  Good reading, a good introduction to the forensic linguistics specialty, and a well-crafted invitation to learn more from the author's weighty text.  Nicely done, Dr. Olsson!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SQ2K1MAMKVZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNZ2HHU#wasThisHelpful","R1SQ2K1MAMKVZ5","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This trendy little item fits over the front cover of a pocket-sized (3.5"" x 5.5"") Moleskine Classic Notebook, secured firmly by its own elastic band.  It holds a pen ready to hand, ensuring that your writing stick of choice can be deployed quickly when a worthy idea appears and is in need of preservation.This pen quiver has changed my life.  I used to just clip my pen on the right side of the front cover.  This allowed me to look the notebook's elastic band over the pen and hold the note book more securely closed.  Now the pen is in the quiver and the elastic band slips off occasionally.  And the notebook flips open, spilling contents and exposing pages to the weather.  Also, the bulky quiver now keeps the front cover of the notebook from lying flat, making it difficult to write in the notebook about half of the time.  On top of this, the quiver is overpriced and unattractive.Nevertheless, I love the quiver and plan to buy a second one.  It is stylish as hell.  I like having my pen right there for all to see with enough room for a backup pen, laser pointer, Slim Jim, or small lethargic snake.  I can impress my acquaintances endlessly with my good taste and comfortable level of disposable income.  I am boundlessly grateful to the Native American yuppies that invented the pen quiver and shared it with the world.

"This collection is the second volume of science fiction stories collected by Harlan Ellison.  He intends them to represent the creative and unrestrained voices that were emerging in the genre at that time.  The first volume is Dangerous Visions; a planned third volume was never published.Here are five of the forty that I liked a little more than the rest:Ursula Le Guin's ""The Word for World is Forest"" is the novella version of the subsequently published novel The Word for World is Forest.  Heavily influenced by the author's view of the Vietnam War, the story chronicles human colonization of the planet Athshe and their exploitation of its native sentient species.  Initially passive, the natives eventual decide they have had enough.Joanna  Russ's ""When It Changed"" takes place on the planet Whileaway where there have been no men for centuries.  When male astronauts from Earth reestablish contact with this lost colony, it is clear that contact with men will impact the planet's culture and values.  Not everyone is pleased at the prospect.Chad Olliver's ""King of the Hill"" begins in the near future on an Earth expiring in a swamp of pollutants.  Sam looks around him for some way to use his great wealth to make this dying place a little better.  He sees no hope.  So he turns his attention to who will inherit when he is gone.Piers Anthony's ""In the Barn"" is built around the existence of parallel realities, each with its own Earth, solar system, stars, etc.  Some realities differ greatly from ours, some differ only slightly.  Hitch is an investigator who travels between realities to evaluate differences from our own and the advisability of official contact.  In his latest investigation he makes a close contact within Reality #772's dairy industry and learns the importance of proper breeding.Ben Bova's ""Zero Gee"" is a roommate story.  Chet, Jill, and Linda spend a few days in a space station on a mission for the U.S. Air Force.  There isn't a lot of privacy.  And sometimes three really is a crowd.  `Nuff said.And there is even some interesting poetry by Ray Bradbury.  There are some good stories here.  Most do not have that frantic, trying-too-hard-to-shock feel that was too much present in the first volume.  Perhaps the nearly ten years that passed between the two publication dates had something to do with it.  The new voices were starting to become the voices we were used to.

"Harlan Ellison collected these thirty-two stories to familiarize readers with the ""new"" voice in 1960's science fiction which broke taboos, flouted conventions, and challenged assumptions.  He solicited stories which had something to say.  ""Each story is almost obstinately entertaining.  But each one is filled with ideas as well.  Not merely run-of-the-pulps ideas you've read a hundred times before, but fresh and daring ideas.""Here are seven that seemed a little better than the others:- Frederik Pohl's ""The Day After the Day the Martians Came"" - When the Martians arrive there is worldwide excitement.  Then the wonder wears off and everybody starts talking about them.- Miriam deFord's ""The Malley System"" - A new method of punishing violent criminals reduces the recidivism rate dramatically.  But not the rehabilitation rate.- Larry Niven's ""The Jigsaw Man"" - In the future there is strong public support for an organ donation program integrated with the driving licensing process.  What possible harm?- James Cross's ""The Doll-House"" - This is more of a three-wishes-from-a-genie fantasy story than it is science fiction.  The moral:  Treat your genie well.- John Brunner's ""Judas"" - This story reenacts an important New Testament lesson.- Norman Spinrad's ""Carcinoma Angels"" - A man who has achieved everything is diagnosed with cancer.  He fights and wins his last battle.  Alone.- Samuel Delany's ""Aye, and Gomorrah..."" - Explores relationships between asexual Spacers, who are neutered before puberty, and frelk, who are attracted to them.This anthology and its second volume, Again, Dangerous Visions, are important landmarks in science fiction history and contain some innovative and provocative ideas.  There is a noticeable, but not off-putting air of adolescence about the way many of the stories jump in the reader's face.  You can get a feel for this from two of the shorter stories.  Henry Slesar's ""Ersatz"" delivers a sexual shock (to 1960's sensibilities) without having much else to say.  Damon Knight's ""Shall the Dust Praise Thee?"" makes similar gratuitous use of a religious topic.  It's a sixties thing.Nevertheless, there are some good stories that are worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJYP1RDLO0TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVFNP3M#wasThisHelpful","R1JJYP1RDLO0TN","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another Robert Heinlein book for young people written during the 1950s.  It mixes the excitement of space exploration with the closeness and competitiveness of identical twins.  It fits into Heinlein's Future History series, but does not require familiarity with any of the other stories.Tom and Pat are identical twin teenagers who have always been close.  In fact, they discover they have been communicating telepathically without realizing it since early childhood.  This ability they share with some other pairs of identical twins turns out to be valuable to space exploration.  Before long, Tom is headed for the stars in a torch ship while Pat remains behind.  Their telepathic link allows real-time communication between Earth and explorers remote from our solar system.After Tom and Pat part, the story develops along two lines.  Tom reports on expeditionary life, with challenges ranging from petty shipboard disagreements to contacting new and dangerous alien species.  Readers also follow the relationship between Tom and Pat, who is aging at a must faster rate due to the effects of relativity.  Things become more interesting as Tom.develops a telepathic link and close relationship, with one of Pat's female descendants.  These two story lines eventually converge.Although written as a Heinlein juvenile, this story contains themes also interesting to adults.  It is worth reading and adding to your collection.

"Lawrence Smith is an unknown, untalented actor who gets a lucky break.  He looks just like a prominent politician and is offered a job to pose as his look-a-like while the politician is off on a secret errand.  Initially reluctant, Smith is pressed into service by a crisis.  And then he becomes trapped in the role indefinitely.The twin-of-somebody-famous plot is as old as The Man in the Iron Mask and has been explored by practically every television sitcom at some point.  Robert Heinlein pulls it off reasonably well.  The book explores the limits of what people actually know about each other, long-term consequences of living as an impostor, and how alliances based on deception can evolve over time.  It tells a pretty good story, too.  The plot trajectory is often predictable, but it was probably less so when the story was originally published.Read this one if you are a diehard Heinlein fan who has not yet experienced it.  Or if you want to think a bit about issues of identity and pretense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY37MTK222NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050OVMWG#wasThisHelpful","R2JY37MTK222NX","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dan invents some very clever and marketable mechanical devices that ease the burden of housework.  A stereotypical engineer, he has no business sense and leaves all of the financial arranging to his partner.  Who, of course, betrays him.  Depressed and destitute, Dan decides to delay decisions and drop out.*  He goes into suspended animation for thirty years and emerges to face a changed world.  Changed in some ways he had not anticipated.  Dan learns that time travel is now possible and vows to return to the past and make things right.  We wonder how he can succeed and whether he will finally get the girl.It's a good Robert Heinlein story with interesting characters and a signature reverence for science and technical details.  The characters are uncomplicated--you can always tell the good guys from the bad guys even when poor Dan cannot.  Heinlein introduces the vocabulary and paradoxes of time travel with minimal pain.  This may not be the very best first experience with Heinlein or time travel, but it will do.The book is recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story and doesn't mind invented technology that now seems dated.  Readers hungry for more of Heinlein's views on time travel should pick up a copy of his ""All You Zombies-"".  It will make your head spin.

"It's the future.  And some people have twice the normal lifespan.  This carefully guarded secret becomes known to the general public who demand access to life-extending medical treatments.  Unfortunately there aren't any.  The longevity enjoyed by members of the ""Howard Families"" results from naturally-occurring genes and selective breeding.  The public is disbelieving, envious, and angry.  Efforts are commenced to extract the secrets of extended life through force.Most members of the Howard Families go into hiding.  In the middle of this crisis Lazarus Long, the oldest living Howard, reappears.  Long presumed dead*, Lazarus has mastered the skills of secrecy and survival.  He leads the Families in a bold attempt to leave Earth and colonize planets around other stars.  The story follows Lazarus and his co-conspirators in their quest for a new home.This is the prototypical Robert Heinlein science fiction novel.  It ties together earlier works in his Future History series and links it to the following series (beginning with Time Enough for Love) that focuses on Long and his family.  Lazarus is clearly another version of the author's recurring ""Grouchy Wise Old Man"" character.  He is quick-tempered, opinionated, and peppers his dialogue with useful nuggets of knowledge.  He is also a dirty old man, which Heinlein goes to great pains to justify.  How-to science is center stage as Long delivers extended descriptions of spaceship piloting, exobiology, and so on.This book may also be the best ""read it first"" Heinlein work.  If you are a science fiction fan and haven't read it, do so.  If you don't have it in your library of science fiction classics, you should.  If like me, you are moving your library onto your Kindle, go ahead and buy it a second time.  It shouldn't be left behind as you move into your own future history._____*Sorry about that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGSY05FQ8FVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MITAWI#wasThisHelpful","RKGSY05FQ8FVL","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers follow Thorby through several distinct phases of his young life.  We first encounter him being sold as a slave on the planet Sargon.  He is bought by an old beggar, Baslim, who feeds, protects, and educates him.  It soon becomes clear that Baslim is an intelligence agent, tracking the movements of the interplanetary slave trade.  When Baslim's activities are discovered, Thorby barely escapes from Sargon with his life.Thorby next finds a home on the Free Trader ship Sisu, where he learns the skills of spaceship life and lives by the unusual customs of Free Trader families.  There are interesting comparisons made between life as a slave and the obligations and structured roles of the Free Traders.  Thorby soon transfers to a military ship of the Earth-based Hegemonic Empire.  On the way to Earth, Thorby adjust to a new culture, learning the customs and constrains of military shipboard service.  Investigations finally reveal Thorby's true identity and family connections.  He takes up the reigns of a new set of obligations on Earth.  Ultimately he must make some decisions about what kind of life he wants to live.This book is yet another book of successful Robert Heinlein ""juvenile"" science fiction.  Written in an age of technology focus, this work points the way to a sociological emphasis more typical of late 60's and early 70's genre writing.  Not only does Thorby encounter and compare several distinct cultures, but even has the help of an anthropologist at one point to guide his growth in perspective.  Heinlein has written something far beyond the clichéd space opera typical of his time.This is classic, old-school science fiction by one of the Grand Masters.  Definitely worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEXFT1O2LT2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OLRPI0#wasThisHelpful","RSEXFT1O2LT2K","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Juan Rico graduates from high school and goes off to war, where he learns how to fight, sees some of his friends get killed, and finds out that his high school history teacher was right about life and responsibility.  Sounds like a cliché WWII movie, doesn't it?  Many of the ideas came from that war and the author's experiences in the U.S. Navy.  But he used those experiences to write science fiction instead of historical fiction.The enemy in this book are the Bugs, ferocious aliens from outside of our solar system who open hostilities by nuking a few of Earth's major cities.  (Including Juan's home town.)  Learning to fight requires operating a highly automated and nearly autonomous spacesuit and numerous beam, projectile, and hand weapons.  Juan's reflections on the lessons of his teacher, a combat veteran, provide a forum for Heinlein to lecture the reader about self-reliance, responsibility, and citizenship.This is a representative Heinlein juvenile science fiction novel.  Everything from the action to the politics fits the bill.  The technology has aged well and the politics... well, readers will have to decide that issue for themselves.  It's worth reading.Do NOT confuse this book with the very shallow and stupid movie of the same name.  Don't see that movie, either.  Read the book instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50GW6B7R6187/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EYTK2C#wasThisHelpful","R50GW6B7R6187","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teenager Bill Lermer travels to Ganymede with his father, and his new step-mother and step-sister.  Readers get a Bill's-eye view of a future resource-depleted Earth; life on board an interplanetary colony ship; dirt-level terraforming of Ganymede; and the challenges of adolescence.  The latter include adjusting to his blended family, conflicts with others his age, and finding the right distance to maintain from girls.This novel originally appeared as a serial in Boy's Life magazine.  There is a strong Boy Scout influence in the story which blends well with the frontier setting and skills needed to survive in it.  This is classic Robert Heinlein science fiction from the 1950s.  The science is dated, but charmingly so.  The adventure of space colonization nicely parallels the main character's coming of age.One disappointed observation--the story could have gone on longer or easily supported a sequel.  It's odd that a prolific writer like Heinlein did not follow up with one.  Perhaps some detail of the licensing arrangement with Boy's Life explains this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPK1HYSW9AP41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APAEDBW#wasThisHelpful","RPK1HYSW9AP41","ACT2AA008KB31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACT2AA008KB31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The non contact thermometer has been a really great and reliable tool when my kids get sick. This is easy to use and measure temperature. The general build is solid and dependability. You just hold the thermometer 2"" from the forehead/temple area and push the button and within 2 to 3 seconds you have the temperature without being invasive or spreading any germs through contact. It has big  white LCD backlight, so it is ease to read digits, even in dark room. You don't need to turn light on. At the same time,  you have to follow the instructions. We wanted something we could check our 5 year old daughters temperature without being invasive (even while she slept) and this fits the bill.It works by sensing temperature difference between object (usually our daughter) and the environment. First, as instructed, do not expect it to be accurate right out of the box. The batteries need 10min to calibrate once placed in thermometer. Second, you can't take it into a different room (if the room is a different temp) and expect it to be accurate immediately, again it needs 10min to recalibrate. As most thermometer, the digital thermometer reads in Fahrenheit and Celsius all from the safe on/off button. One of my favorite features is the reading memory help to help you keep track on each temperature change.So far we have found this Thermometer by GRDE very accurate and easy to use. We have tried remote temp monitors but he either pulls the probe off, or it moves out of the armpit, so although they are a great idea; they have been no help. This product while not able to continually monitor him, makes the job of taking his temp much easier. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

It has slots for credit cards, drivers license, and phone. The case attached to the cardholder by magnet, and it's easily detachable from the wallet case that holds everything together. Unfortunately, she is one of those people who puts too many cards and mine so it doesn't stay closed, but if you only have a couple of things inside, it will close beautifully.The wrist lanyard is a nice touch because not many wallet case has them.

This set comes with a screen protector  along with a Stylus, which makes this set even better to have compare to the some of  the competitors.Other then that my Aunt love this cute wallet case.

"This box Android 5.1 TV box by VicTsing is really good and everything works well. Initial setting is not difficult but I had my husband set this up because he's pretty handy with these type of things, We just spent about 15 to 20 minutes to figured out how to use it to watch live TV and movies. I got a wireless keyboard and mouse, which is necessary. Reason being when setting up the box I recommend using a USB mouse and download the zipped apps to usb and load them via USB instead of downloading. This will save you some time. With a little patience I got everything set up and working properly.Once it worked properly we were both glued to the TV. The picture can be formatted to fit your TV so no more cut off pictures. Picture quality depends on what you are watching. Some of the streams are crystal clear HD quality, some of them are not so great but still watchable. Sound is very important to me so if you like watching movies and shows through the speakers on your TV, it's ok for that. There is still a lot to investigate, and I feel improvements will come though the internet eventually. Since this is the only android box I have experience with, I can't speak for any others. Make sure your internet connection is adequate because that will also interfere with the streaming process. Yesterday my router went out so my internet was not working properly. I did a good bit of fussing before I realized what the problem was.The movie selection is AMAZING. We have a Roku and this is hands down better. There are new releases that I can watch. Plus I can catch a series I wanted to watch from the very first pilot episode. That in itself was a selling point for me. Videos stream effortlessly with no tiling or buffering. The only time I had problems is when my internet was off line. Overall, my husband and I  like the Android box and would recommend to other people wanting to have literally UNLIMTED streaming of Movies, sports, shows, etc. This is the biggest reason why we tried out this box because it gives us the flexibility to add on what we want in our household. Other then that this box works well. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"Our 17 year old daughter does track and she was complaining of shin splints, so she gave this post Op she a try to see if it would help. She’s rather petite and the bottom of the boot is really built up and slightly heavy for her. She wears a size 9 shoe and it fit okay with a slight space on the toe area. The foam padding inside is very comfortable and protective. The straps are wide and adjustable for ease in putting on and taking off.

"Looking at the this pink vibrator certainly does look like a kids toy even though it’s meant for mature consumers. The construction along with the shape and size would work wonderfully for quality G-Spot massage, and that the clitoral tickler (attached to the shaft's base) was long enough for intense external titillation and it does. The internal massage is definitely the most powerful but the two tails do have some vibration to them. Its great the its waterproof and silent in order to maintain discreet.There are two buttons on this toy - one for power on and the other for setting it to the desired vibrations. Though there are only 3 different speeds it’s easy to change to the settings depending on your mood but it might be quite overwhelming for users who have minimal experience with penetration.As for the care its not too complicated due to the smooth surface and non-existence texture, instead of just cleaning this toy with a wet wipe after use, you should immediately wash it with antibacterial soap and warm water or a sex toy cleaner.

"Straight up, I love to drink tea and enjoy trying new flavors. This is a very relaxing and delicious tea; I could easily drink more than the recommended 1 cup daily. The longer your steep your tea the deeper in color the liquid will turn. The flavor to this detox tea is different than anything I've tried. Very pleasant and refreshing mild flavor. The tea itself is so good with big chunks of fruit, leaves and seeds. It has an amazing taste that is A LOT better than other detox teas I have tried smelling and tasting of herbs, berries, lemon, etc. It's made with natural ingredients such as - Senna Leaf, Goji Berries, Dandelion, Ginger, Strawberry Leaf, Myrtle Leaf, Blueberry Leaf, Hibiscus Flower, Rose Hips, Juniper Berry and Natural Fruit Flavoring. Plus I love that it comes in a zip lock package to reassure continuous freshness.To be honest I would enjoy drinking it even without the health benefits! But, it's nice to know I'm doing something good for my body too. I did look up all of the ingredients individually just to educate myself on what each of them did.This is definitely a high quality product that is so refreshing to drink. I used this and has really helped me with some bloating and discomfort plus boosted my energy level.  Externally, after the 4th day my skin also looked clear and brighter! I know you are reading this review and wondering if it works as far as weigh loss goes. It is too soon to tell, I know it will take a few weeks.

"This is actually a good Bike phone mount.  Holds my son’s Samsung Galaxy 5 with its OtterBox Commuter case no problem. He rode with it a couple of times with no issues so far. Being able to mount the phone in this holder makes the ride more comfortable for me and less risky for the phone, and I would recommend this mount to others for such use if you have a phone (with case) that is less than 3 1/4 inches wide. Installation was not difficult and the instructions helped make the job quick. Once installed and on the road, there seems little vibration; the base of this mount seems quite strong and well constructed, while the actual phone-holder facing seems to work just fine but is made of lighter weight material than the base is. I love the is has the band straps for extra security.This mount is fully adjustable with its 360 rotation for various angles. I sense that this holder can fit well on most any size bar/pipe, so handlebars are an easy fit. It secures well with a quick-clamp similar to bike seat posts and the like. The pads on the sides help get a snug fit and keep from scratching your phone, though I always have mine in a case anyway. The mount itself is made of quick thick and sturdy plastic, well constructed.Overall, this is a fine way to keep your phone protected from bumps and holes, but it allows you to keep in touch while you ride. A good thing to have for communications and just in case you needs a little help. Recommend this bike mount by Comsun. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"These set of screen protector by Consum is simply fantastic on my sister’s iPhone 6. Once received it came in a nice secured white package! The application for her phone was extremely easy and very fast. The whole process probably took her no more than 2 to 4 minutes. Base on her previous screens she did have some problems with rising edges, bubbles and the clarity of the screen, which was rather annoying and distracting to me while working or reading emails, but this screen doesn’t even come close to these issues.Besides the smooth feeling, you can barely see the screen protector, which is a plus for her. It fits perfectly along the edges of her phone with no corner lifts or snags.

"I love these colorful braided mesh bath straps by HOMMP.  I gave one to each member of my family. They do a great job of exfoliating the skin while getting to the hard places on your body--like your back, etc. They aren't a soft sponge but they aren't abrasive either like some other people mentioned. Unless you have extremely sensitive skin you shouldn't have a problem. They break in with time and aren't quite as stiff after enough uses. At first they seemed short but they stretch quite a bit after you've been using them for a while. Once you break them in they are perfect. The strap handles are  sewn in well and constructed good enough so that it won’t out or off. I like these because they make washing your back very easy. I love low maintenance and this has held up to my expectations. I simply rinse the Loofahs after use, squeeze out excess water, a little reshaping so it lays flat for next use, but then I just hang it on a hook in my shower to air dry.

"These are good garbage bags by HOMMP. Comes in a nice big roll and they are easy to tear apart. First, when you put them into the can, they reach all the way down to the bottom of the can - no problem. Next, they comfortably fit around the top opening of the can without having to stretch the bag over one side then the other, then going back again to stretch back over the first side again!! Our cans have a wide opening, and these breeze right on in. You can fill the garbage can to the very top and then when you take the bags out, there's still plenty of room to grab the bag and remove it from the container without ever touching any of the garbage inside of the bag and there's room to even tie a knot in the bag before carrying it out. We've had no tears or rips. I suggest that you don't overload the bag because you need enough space left at the top to use the drawstring plus these bags aren’t heavy duty but more on the thin side.The description says 6 gallon, I'd say these are definitely in the 8 to 10 gallon range. I mostly use them for our cans.  We have a trashcan that's divided into two sections, so we use these on one side and regular garbage bags on the other. It's the perfect way to store our recyclables so we don't have to go out to the garage over and over again. With 6 people living in the house (and single-stream recycling in our area), we end up with a ton of recycling, so these have been great. Furthermore I use them as recycling bags for our car. We always have water bottles and pop cans from our journeys so instead of throwing them out, I bring along one of these bags and recycle them when we get home. And even better, I can see these lasting for several months! You get a good amount of bags for the asking price, recommend them. Received this product as a sample in exchange for a honest review.

"I love this Nutri Ninja Auto iQ and the best part is the clean up is nothing compared to juicers. First, I love the outlook of this machine,  it’s handsome and rather classy looking. It does not take up much of my counter space and can be placed in a drawer when not in use. There are only 4 buttons on the machine, which eliminates the guesswork of blending. I do not have to sit by it to make sure the cap does not come off like my regular blender nor do I have to check to see if the blending is complete.It comes with three sizes of blending cups, the largest of which is a full 32 ounces, or one quart. Generally this doesn't mean that you end up with a 32-ounce smoothie, because you always reduce the content in size when you blend. It is super convenient to use the straw top right on the cup to go. OT is easier to clean that a Kitchen aid type blender...less parts, and just an easier shaped blending vessel. There are no hidden places for gross banana purée to get stuck in which is a pet peeve of mine. So far what I like about is this:Pros:-The iQ is actually really nice. It pulses on it's own and the timing is perfect to get everything nice and smooth.-The narrow cup size makes it more likely to fit into cup holders if you are taking it to go in the morning.-The propeller on the base that attaches to the blades is made out of hard rubber (see my comment about the bullet below).-1000W of power crushes anything you could possibly put in it (that is actually food).-Blends everything so smooth, The only thing I have encountered that it has trouble with is flax seed (whole). It brakes it down some but you still get little pieces.-The design of the blade is easy to clean (compared the the bullet)Cons:-Loud (but comes with the territory)-Only comes with one blade (unlike the Nutribullet 900 that comes with two).-When it pulses the blender can actually move across the counter top. So depending on the surface, this could be problematic if you put it on auto and walk away.- The suction feet on the unit really grab the surface they're sitting on and it can be a pain in the you-know-what to unstick them when you want to move the unit. The trick is to tip the unit backward from the front and presto! -- the feet release the unit.Yes, it comes with a nice dietary advice book that I might take some cues from, but that's really not what I will use this Nutri Ninja Auto iQ for most of the time. If I'm honest, I wanted it because I wanted something ideal for making smoothies and shakes. Other then that I look forward to trying lots of different things in the days to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GX7UF4ZKYM0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGV3X2W#wasThisHelpful","R2GX7UF4ZKYM0R","A3C6CZC2JP67VK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C6CZC2JP67VK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These smart balance scooters are awesome. Once you get over the initial learning curve (which is pretty short), this scooter is a lot of fun! It accelerates by simply applying pressure with the front your feet. It carries two driver motors within the wheels that can be controlled with both feet individually for easy turns, rotation, acceleration and smooth breaking. We have ridden this in our neighborhood, on the local streets, and in parks, and my sons have had a blast using it. Yes, it is an expensive toy, but it was totally worth it in my opinion. The motor is terrific on this scooter, a very intelligent design in my humble opinion. As I've already mentioned, when going downhill, the motor doesn't let the scooter pick up too much speed, it keeps it in check. If you hit maximum speed (whether going downhill or just on a flat surface), the motor rattles telling you that it's reaching max speed. The motor is also designed to make turning easier. If you apply too much pressure on one foot in an attempt to turn, it will rattle telling you that the balance is off.It seems there are several brands in the market for this type of scooter. They are all effectively exactly the same product coming from exactly the same factory, just sold under different brand names. The price tags on these vary between $200 to $1900 (insane!), depending entirely on the price a particular brand wants to charge for this product. Only the packaging and manuals are different, and some companies may include some extras like kneepads, but the scooter itself is exactly the same. So if you are unsure of which one to buy, I would say that you can go for the one that is priced lowest and can be delivered to you the quickest. I fine that a great number of companies send this directly from China which can takes several weeks to arrive. So look for a domestic company to order from (of course their price may be slightly but think of the peace of mine). Other then that this is a great product. It's really easy to get used too and one of the best things I've ever rode. The board is really durable and its so soothing to ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17O578XX4JMZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OG8NRS#wasThisHelpful","R17O578XX4JMZR","A3C6CZC2JP67VK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C6CZC2JP67VK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an incredibly warm scarf by Tahari, and quite unlike any other that I own. This is a chucky knit scarf that feels homemade, but it’s fairly priced, and you didn’t have to spend days making it. The colors are great—very bold and very complimentary. It’s a shorter scarf; it is made more to keep you warm than for the style aspect of it.It’s really stretchy and I’d say that it would fit pretty much any sized neck. I love how you can adjust it different ways to get different looks all in one scarf. I decided to wear it for my son's football game and it held it's shape very well. It kept me warm and cozy as well. The next task I had to put it thru was washing. It handled washing and drying multiple times without shrinking, stretching, loosing shape or color!There is a good number of different color combinations that you will surely find one that fits your liking. This is excellent for winter since it’s so warm and secure. Overall, for the price, the fabric and the look, I think this a great buy—highly recommended.

"This pure and natural rose water by Regent Naturals is a great addition to my beauty regiment. It's a fabulous facial toner and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Rose water is touted to tone, clarify and hydrate my combination skin. I like that you used this as an anti-inflammatory and can produce a calming effect on your skin. This also has a subtle Rose smell. It is not super strong so you won't go around smelling. Unlike a lot of synthetic fragrances, this doesn't have that cloying heavy-handed fake smell that ends up giving you a headache.So here is how I use it, after using my toner I spritz my face with rose water. If I'm wearing make-up after everything is applied and I'm ready, I do a spritz. At the end of the day if I need a pick me up, spritz. When I need to remove eye make up, obviously I don't spritz, but apply to a cotton pad and remove, If it's real heavy-duty stuff this may not cut it, but for my needs this is usually fine. It does a great job at removing makeup and keeping my pores minimized. It makes my skin feel so soft; it's not oily at all. It leaves your face feeling refreshed and ready for the day in the morning and in the evening it leaves your face feeling refreshed and ready to hop in bed for a nice relaxing evening. Plus I haven't had any adverse reactions, so I'm going to continue using it because I like the results I've gotten so far.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good toner and cleanser for your face. It's good for the hair, which I’ll probably give it a try one day. I would definitely recommend this product since it is so useful. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"I wanted these black jogging Harem pants for myself. These pants are so light and comfortable by Leward.  It fit me great with a bit of a baggier style, which is neat, plus I love the width of the waistband because it hugs my stomach nicely. The material is soft and the outlook the pants is really nice. The material is a medium weight. Great for lounging around in or out of the house.For me the L fitted me as I expected and went two size up as instructed. I would normally wear a medium or a small depending on the cut of the item but the size L works. Although the size as listed as a male large, this is very far from a men's large, at least in the US that is. I'm a 5'6 130 lbs. female & the large fit me pretty well. I wore it yesterday and really felt comfortable while doing my errands. I have to say that the pockets are rather huge to the point that you hands can get lost in them. It’s certainly deep enough to keep my Samsung S6 edge phone and portable battery charger in one pocket without sticking out. It is like having a tool belt without looking like a contractor. While laying on the couch, the phone does not fall out of the pocket, slide down into the couch, lose a charge, turn off or crack dial anyone. The bottom band around my legs is not too tight but I can push them up further if I need to.I also washed these and tumble dried on medium heat and I did not have any shrinkage or fading in the colors. The drawstring is a bit thicker and I tired the ends so they would not slip through when washing.  Overall, for the price, the fabric and the look, I think this a great buy—highly recommended.

"You can actually feel the good quality of these shorts. The fabric along with the button and zipper is well made and not flimsy. I ordered a size 30” and my 14 year old son love them so much he wore them the this past weekend. Of course when it comes to Cargo shorts you get lots of pockets with buttons. His smartphone fits nicely vertically and does not fall out like some of the other shorts he owns. He use’s the cargo pockets a lot and they don't begin to flare out like most cargo short pockets. And the nothing will fall out of the regular side pockets no matter how deep the couch is your sitting on.As for the length, they hit just about the knee. There is no belt despite the pictures showing otherwise. But I don't normally wear a belt with my shorts so I wasn't too concerned. Straps hang loose all over these shorts. At the bottom of each leg, there are two straps that he can tie together to close up the opening around each leg. There are two more straps hanging off the front pockets. We're not sure what those are for. Maybe it's a fashion statement. Other than the odd straps, we like it.The shorts look great and feel comfortable, make sure to pay attention to the correct sizing information and you'll get a fitting pair.

"This Leward empire Boho halter dress is rather nice. It slightly figure forms you so you can feel both sexy and modest at the same time. Just to let you know I am 5'6"", a 36D on top and slender/curvy on bottom so this fitted me comfortably. It came well package and secure as well. The only downside to this is that I though the color would me more vibrant as pictured but it’s more on the Matte hue if that makes any sense.The material is nicely soft to the touch and doesn’t restrict your movement at all. Plus the material is not itchy on the skin. I also like the way it fits on me. The dress was easy to put on effortlessly. I like that it provides a padded bust coverage so you don’t have to worry about bra straps and the V cut is not too low which is good.In addition, I believe this particular piece can stretch out to fit up to a size 6 for sure. It washes really well too without losing its form. Plus I like to air dry my dresses. Beside that I think it was worth the inexpensive price so it doesn’t hurt to give it a try!

"I enjoy sleeping in a hammock when outside, because it keeps me off of the ground, out of bugs and away from snakes. This Hammock would be great for camping or just if you wanted to have a lazy day and just rest among the trees Reading a good book. I find it particularly useful for climbing trips. The material is a good balance of heavy duty construction that is still breathable and comfortable. The seams are mostly triple stitched except for the outer hem.Pros:-Holds up to 330 lbs.-Has everything needed to hang (no additional cost)-Packs into own pocket-Affordable-Durable-Nice Color ComboCons:-Might be a bit large for some (although could be considered a benefit based upon your needs).Furthermore, I love that it doesn't stretch out of shape, and tucks back up into the sewn on storage bag. The Hammock fits very well in the bag. It is easy to put the Hammock into it. The anchor points are strong and hook to the ropes that came with the hammock very well. (I like using cargo / ratchet straps for longer distance and strength IMO). Overall, this hammock by Leward has everything you could want, except for maybe a mosquito net if you live in buggy areas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2O6INHEOO50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMKE26I#wasThisHelpful","R2D2O6INHEOO50","A3C6CZC2JP67VK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C6CZC2JP67VK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been wanting to try these wraps for sometime so it was great to try them. The Body wrap sticks to your skin, as the cloth stretches as u applying it with no saran wrap. There is no liquid mess. You can easily wear this body wrap running errands or while sleeping (up to 8 hours), very convenient! The body wrap can be cut for other areas you may target which is nice.  I used the wrap on my stomach and I like that it has a hole for your belly button. When measuring myself around the waist I was 28 inches. As directed I did one application on Wednesday night 11/04/15 and Saturday evening 11/07/15; I noticed a difference by Sunday morning 11/08/15. I continued to notice a reduction in my belly fat. Then I place another wrap on Tuesday evening 11/10/15 following the same procedure. I re-measured and it come out to be 26 inches, which is pretty amazing leaving two wraps behind right now.They definitely stayed in place and didn't shift or move around at all. Once you put them on there's no taking them off to resituate them back on but it's simple to make sure you get them on right in the first place. There's no scent to them whatsoever. I'm guessing that if you have a big belly you might not be satisfied, because it will take you longer to see results. At the same time, don't get discourage on after your first applicator, you will continue to get results. If you are working with a little gut, little pooch...etc., something medium to small and you need something to get your stomach flat or from getting bigger; you can use these to help firm and contour your stomach for sure. At the same time I drink a lot of water throughout the day, it’s just my way on cutting back from sugar drinks.Here is what I do: (before bed):1. As Directed I shower, dry off and dry skin brush my whole stomach area, enough to get the blood circulating and get the area warm.2. Apply the wrap along the stomach area.3. Sleep with the applicator on ALL night 10:00 pm to 7:00 am (if you want good results this is a must.)4. Next morning take the wrap off and go about my day.5. Waited between 2 to 3 days to place another applicator at night.Though I’m 41, I can't stop the aging process but I sure can stop 'how' I age. (Side note: I also exercise and use a host of necessary vitamins and supplements so I continue to stay young and healthy and vibrant).

"This ring is absolutely stunning by MNH. The brushed texture made the ring really pop. I loved the two-tone effect; it made the color of the ring and the textured effect stand out more.

"This silver scale is great. So much handier and more accurate than trying to fit a bulky bag on my human-sized bathroom scale. At the same time I do own a number of these hand scale. The construction of this device is great.Compared to our other luggage scale I like two features on this one better. This scale will lock in the final weight and continue to display it either with a red or green light. A green light means your baggage is below 50 lbs. and shouldn't incur any overweight baggage fees. A red light turns on at 50 pounds or above indicating you may be charged overweight luggage fees. Awesome display. This is much better than trying to read a weigh that is continuing to change. This also has a nice big handle you can grip with two hands which is helpful when weighing a 50 lb. suitcase. Additionally the strap attachment is helpful for wrapping around suitcase handles of different sizes.This will either pay itself off or give you a whole ton of triumph as you show up to the gate and you've measured everything perfectly.

"O man I’m in love with this car organizer by Fasmov. No more do I have to spend time picking up all the little items and putting them into my back seat when taking on a passenger. No more do my items fall between the seats and become lost. This organizer really helps keep my car neat. Now I no longer have a pile of papers sitting on my passenger seat, my umbrella tossed in the back, and pens floating around who knows where. They're all tucked into place in the organizer. Now when I take on a passenger, it's so easy just to flip the car organizer to the back of the seat. Plus I like that when someone is going to ride with me, I don't have to grab all my mess and toss it in the back. I just flip this around in one swoop and when I am solo again, I can swoop it back just as easily.It works just as well as the higher models and it has a lot of room for all of your stuff that you will need. I notice that it works great in the front of the seat, the back of the seat, and even the side of the seat if need be. The quality is pretty good and seems to hold up pretty well. I personally like the adjustable webbed straps buckle around headrest posts for a secure fit for my drinks.I would like it if it came in different colors would be great as well so you could pick one the color of your seat so it could blend in and it wouldn't be so conspicuous.

"This headphone is sweet and I fine the sound sharp, clear, and intense. I listen to a wide range of music, from jazz to hip-hop, and pretty much everything in between. So, I like my headphones to be capable of producing heavy bass, but I also like to be able to tone that down quite a bit to focus on other instruments and vocals in other kinds of music. As you open the package of course you get the headphones in a molded plastic case. The case has a nylon zipper with a metal closure and a Sentey-logo’d pull. The cord will be to the left ear cup hat, with the inline control module about 6” from the left cup at that.What I love about these is that they cover the over the ear well, and do a pretty good job of isolating outside sound and delivering your input’s sound. They are comfortable and easily adjustable. At the same time you can turn them down and listen to them at a comfortable level and they do a good enough job of canceling out ambient noise. They don't have the greatest noise cancellation, though, and they do bleed some music at higher volumes, so know that if you're in a quiet area with them turned way up, others will be able to hear the music. With that I had my husband help me with that area.They look just as cool as any of the popular sets out there. Maybe not the highest quality materials as the high-end phones, but in no way do they appear as cheap. It's obvious that in order to offer pro studio quality sound at an extremely low price, it appears that Sentey understood what materials were best suited to achieve this. At the same time these headphones are very attractive, with cool colors that by no means have a cheap look.Other then that, this headphones couldn't be more comfortable.

"I’ve wanted to improve my meditation practice led me to try this sleep mask and it worked great! I meditate best with minimal light and noise and I found this eye mask to be a perfect solution to help with that. The fit of this mask is a solid design, comfortable to wear and does not fall off when I move while sleeping. At times you will come across some minor light bleed comes into the eye from the nose area at first, but the mask adapts/molds to your face over time. It's kind of like wearing a nice piece of well-fitting clothing on your head. The elastic band does not cut into the back of your head like with other sleep masks.This handy travel pillow can easily be rolled up and put back into its nylon carry case. A big Pro about this pillow is that it vary inflation level allowed me to get a good fit. Plus the texture is comfortable, and doesn't make you feel like you're going to slide off.I also like it when traveling to help me sleep. It keeps out the light, it is very comfortable, and having the earplugs included securely in the band means I never have to look for where I put them!

"This is adorable, I place this in my study and its makes my office smell nice. The design and outlook of this oil diffuser is pretty. I feel that it will do well in small size rooms. It's certainly easy to use and powers off of a USB port. I've used lavender oil and rosemary oil with this diffuser. The mist does a great job at filling the room with relaxing scents. Furthermore it’s better to have your celling fan off to get a better affect of the essential oils.What I also like about this unit is that it helps with your immune system, since I catch colds very easily during season changes, while providing extra moisture for your body.It’s great that the diffuser has an auto shut off feature when water runs out. This is especially nice to have when the run is unattended. Overall the Bella Home International Diffuser works y well in my eyes. It’s easy to set up and fills my area with a refreshing scent. Highly Recommended. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"I got these shorts for my son's school uniform. My son wears a 14, because they run a little big the 12 works fine, using the waist adjuster for difference. Perfect fit with room to grow. Shorts don't gather and bunch up with use of the adjusters, so no one knows the shorts are a size and 1/2 larger than needed. Really nice as quickly as children grow! Little ironing required, especially if line dried! So far these are the best school shorts I have purchased in 4 years and will continue to get them as long as they make them and find them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHLLL9KPUUVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK3W4AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SHLLL9KPUUVA","A3C6CZC2JP67VK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C6CZC2JP67VK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our  5-year-old daughter has dropped her tablet  many times and it's just fine. This case is very durable and easy to clean. So far everywhere she goes people want to know where I got it from because its so kid friendly and easy for her to handle.The handles itself makes it interesting versus others because it turns into a  kickstand. She drags her tablet everywhere so the handles are super useful. I have small hands and fingers so don't have a problem reaching the power and volume buttons, but my husbands' hands are large so he has more of a problem reaching them. Bulkier than the smart folio covers, but it has to be if you want it to be protected against a toddler and its actually lightweight. Again it's easy to handle and worth the price on protecting your expensive device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQOT0KWQS0OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZN01UQU#wasThisHelpful","RIQOT0KWQS0OH","A3C6CZC2JP67VK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C6CZC2JP67VK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my 14-year son who rides his bike everywhere. I fine this to be the perfect size to attach to his bike - it doesn't take up too much room and get the job done efficiently and quickly I wanted him to have something that was small and he could carry in his backpack in case of emergencies.This pump is extremely lightweight which is an important feature when dealing with bikes and balance. It has an easy to attach harness that keeps it locked in place, and it's also easy to get it in and out of the harness during use.Other then that this bike pump by Kitbest is very simple pump that's easy to use, and if you're out and about this will be able to give you enough air to get back.

"This went above and beyond my expectations. I have used similar zester/graters in the past and had horrible results because the quality was poor and would bend. Not with this zester. It is very sturdy and worked great. Made just the right size zest that I needed. I like that it is so simple to use.It has fine edges to make grating cheese or fruits easy. I like the fact that it is long and comes with a thick handle. It makes the grating process much faster than what I was use to doing. The handle grip is very comfortable which is important because you don't want your hand to accidentally slip. It's long so you zest more in less strokes.One thing I really like about this particular grater by Erayco is that it is flat, so it doesn't take up much room in a drawer at all, just as much as a kitchen knife would. So far I have tried parmesan, garlic, ginger, lemon, lime, jalapeno and orange on this grater .......... It works amazingly for each one. I highly recommend this zester/grater to anyone that needs it. Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"This waterproof cell phone case by Mengo is effective. Once received it came in a nice secured clear plastic box. I wanted to see how it would travel with my sister’s iPhone 6 plus and it worked perfectly! This teal case is well designed and secure the phone nice and snug. It’s been a rainy week and yesterday she took it with her and notice that the case got wet, but the phone stayed dry! At the same time, she can take photos and videos without taking it out of the case, as it's clear on the front.This is a nice protective case for anyone to have for a moments notice - it will come in handy when you are going to a lake, the beach, waterpark, even out for a walk on a hot day - you never really know when Mother Nature will open the skies! And with this little waterproof case you are always prepared! Plus we both love that this case comes with a few goodies like spare main seal ring, extra plug, and headphone extension, along with cleaning cloths.Loved the size and quality of this case as well. So far she has no nervousness putting her expensive phone inside this case while encountering water. Definitely recommend it! Received this item in exchange for an honest review.

"I have wood floors throughout my entire house except for the bedrooms. I currently use Old English Scratch Cover on a few different items and it has worked well for me over the years. I learnt that products like this does not repair damage to the finish coat. It simply stains the raw wood that is exposed when it is scratched. At the same time we get scratches all the time with a household of 6. I also buy markers that are exactly a marker of the color of my floor as well. They work for a while but then they seem to vanish and the scratches come back which is a tad bit annoying.Now a couple of days ago, I used Wearmax in several spots some that are really bad. It worked really well. At first, I use it on the sample wood provided and it work great. So I decided to use it first underneath the kitchen table and it took the white mark away nicely.  I went back to it a day later and tried to rub it off and it stayed. I believe this will last a long time if not permanent but will see. I also know that on deep scratches you cannot take away how deep it is but you can improve it drastically with Wearmax. Other then that this product is great on mild scratches.

"In my household I decided that every room in the house needs a flashlight that you can have easy access to. This seemed like the perfect solution. This silver LED light is really lightweight and takes 3 AAA batteries. It’s very bright and turns on with a simple click to the black button on the end.This doesn’t come with a wrist strap, which I like but that’s all right. I guess that is nice to those who don't use them but I indent to hang them from a nail on the wall so I had to install all of the wrist straps, which was a bit of a pain in the butt. Plus I fine this also well for kids, since they are perfect for little hands.Other then that, this flashlight by XFIL is good quality for the asking price. I would recommend this light to anyone who enjoys being outside or anyone who want to be safe and stash on in the car.

"This KitKat tablet is awesome for our 5-year-old daughter. This 7"" tablet downloads quickly & has ample amount of memory for our child’s games. This is however, great for kids who are getting their first tablet. What I love about this tablet is that you can create customized profiles for users. You can password protect your account. You can turn on and off the apps you want your user to have access to. For example, you can turn off the browser, but leave the Wi-Fi on for something like YouTube Kids. You can turn off everything that children should not have access to and not have to worry! These are great! She can play them non-stop for about half they time they are awake in a day. The picture on this tablet is pretty nice for this price for sure. I have seen some that cost more and do far less.Furthermore I love the case with the white keyboard. So often there is an extra button or something that gets covered when you get a generic cover. This one fit nicely into the case. I really like the quality of the case as well along with the durability of it. The color was spot on. Right now she doesn’t use the keyboard but very impressed with the case itself and the fit. The quality of this case is very sturdy and is not cheap silicone. It is a high quality cover and I personally like it.This tablet has been perfect for her, so far. She can watch her online videos, play her preschool apps, and she loves taking pictures with the camera. The camera isn't the highest quality, but she doesn't care. She just loves the fact that she has a tablet just like her older siblings. Aside from that the shipment was very prompt. Plus the use of tablet was fairly easy and downloading was fine, everything seemed to be in working order and I am pleased with the quality for the price.

"Our 5-year-old daughter has enjoyed listening to music and audiobooks with these pink lightweight stereo headphones. She can wear these for a long period of time without them irritating her ears.

Earbuds cannot compare to the quality of sound that these provide. The Kidwavz KV-100 will connect to any device that support Bluetooth transmission, this includes iPad, iPhones, Android phones and tablets, computers with Bluetooth etc. so you can use the phone hands-free.

"I have many pairs earphones in my possession. I keep them in the car, in the house, in my purse, gym bag, etc. Basically, I don't like to be anywhere without earphones or headphones. One of the reasons I have so many is because our family goes through them so quickly. I don't know if we're extremely hard on them or what, but we have to replace them frequently.The Brainwavz earphones look and feel like they are made out of  high quality materials. They do not feel flimsy or cheap. Only time will tell if these develop a short due to a kinked wire or something similar. However, you are provided with it's own carrying bag to help keep it safe. Extra ear tips are also included which is very nice.These earphones performed well. I listened to quite a few different genres of music on them. You can hear the bass notes very well. There is some distortion with just regular music play. It sounds good, but it's not as clear and sharp as I think it should be. The volume is good and there is ample adjustment for the desired level.The microphone works very well for me. There was no problem with anyone hearing me during phone calls; even while working out. This is a great value; especially considering that these earphones include a microphone. They are not top of the line or perfect; but for the price range, they are at the top.

"I've been using this particular toothbrush for several years now. I have a habit of pressing too hard when brushing and have done so for years. That coupled with using more firm bristles have worn down my gum line a bit over time. These extra soft bristles coupled with Sensodyne toothpaste have helped minimize discomfort for me and ensure that I'm not causing further damage to my gums. Also important to note that my experience has been that the softer bristles are no less effective at cleaning teeth or preventing cavities than firmer options I've used in the past.

"I've had nothing but positive experiences with Outdoor Research products, so when I decided that I wanted to look into getting a trapper hat for what has been a cold winter, this one made sense.It's important to note that this particular hat is not for everyone. I have what I would consider a pretty average sized head.  Ordered a L after considering the reviews on here and still had to send it back for an XL. That one fits perfectly. If you find yourself wearing larger sized hats, there's a good chance you're out of luck here.The hat is comfortable, warm, and well constructed.  Ear flaps have strong magnets in place to flip them up or down as needed (though I generally just keep them down).  Buttons are available to secure it under the chin if desired.Ear coverage is effective for quick walks on the go, commute, etc.  Even more so if it is secured in place with the chin strap or tucked away in a jacket and/or scarf.  I tend to just throw it on when I'm going to and from work or to walk the dog. But if the wind is whipping or the temp has really dropped they're only so helpful.

"The Benebone MINI Rotisserie Chicken flavor is their 3rd offering.  I received our first chicken Benebone along with a replacement bacon one I had ordered.  I held them both out, our dog gave them both a careful sniff and then she ran away with the bacon one. Can't say I blame her.  She hasn't entirely ignored the chicken, but it's not getting nearly as much love as the bacon.  That one remains her undisputed favorite.  She is an aggressive chewer, so we try and keep a handful of different chew toys in rotation at any given time. It is not dissimilar to a nylabone in terms of the consistency of the material or the effect that aggressive chewing has upon it. Over the span of several nonstop hours of committed chewing, she is able to do some damage. What I have noted is that Benebones seems to be a bit less inclined to develop harsh corners or sharp edges than nylabones. Areas of wear are a bit more flaky and softer to the touch. There is always a concern about very small pieces begin eaten during the course of a good chew session (which is inevitable), but if she must, I'd rather they be smooth and pose less of a risk for her intestines and tummy. If I took away each chew toy that exhibited signs of ""damage"", she'd have no toys left. Even with close supervision, she inevitably eats rice sized pieces while she chews. Having gone through 6-8 Benebones now, I can say that they have held up as well if not better than a nylabone and she always goes for a Benebone first when she has a choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67M90K0MUT34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O69O6X8#wasThisHelpful","R67M90K0MUT34","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always wanted a Thermapen, but just couldn't warrant the expense for the modest amount of cooking and grilling that I do. The ThermoPop was a great compromise and it comes in handy all the time in my kitchen. On the simplest level, it has been a trusted way to ensure that meats are cooked thoroughly and to the desired temperature.  But it has also been incredibly helpful for brewing beer at home and loose leaf tea. It's fast, consistent, backlit, and splash-proof. When temperature matters and being a few degrees off can make a big difference, I definitely trust this thermometer over the shoddy plastic one I was using before.

"I have nothing but good things to say about my Gregory Baltoro 75 backpack, but my wife was tired of seeing me use it for our regular weekend trips.  When I finally caved and started looking for a weekend duffle bag option, this one was a no brainer.It has the same rugged and durable feel of the Baltoro.  Nylon, straps, zippers, buckles, and stitching are all solid.What sold me was the straps and the versatility.  Straps can be velcroed securely together for a traditional bag handle, adjusted longer to sling over the shoulder, or kept separate for padded backpack straps.  I personally haven't had much of a need for that last option, but I enjoy that it's there if I do.  Usually I'm just moving it from the apartment to the car and from the car to my destination.  Shoulder sling usually works just fine for that purpose.It can also be cinched down on the sides to compress the bag a bit when you're not carrying a full load.

"Necessary?  Nope.  Fun novelty?  Yep.  Worth the price to change things up a bit for your next batch of home brew?  I think so.  I will grant that they can be helpful when you take a few bottles from room temperature storage and put them into the fridge.  The bottles can be cold to the touch a few hours later even if the beer isn't anywhere near cold enough yet.  I've found that the caps don't hit their darker blue shade until the beer has done so.  These can also help you distinguish between different batches if you will have a few that are aging.  Plus when you're using brown bottles with no labels it can't hurt to have a little color on there.  Will buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RA9M4CJ9ZFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ3SA5A#wasThisHelpful","R23RA9M4CJ9ZFW","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great way to safely and easily remove some home brew from a 5 gallon batch to test it with a hydrometer.  Gives you a good long reach into the carboy and it does a great job grabbing enough for testing purposes.  Using mine with a 5 gallon glass carboy with a top that accommodates a size 7 stopper.  Sanitize it beforehand to prevent contamination and if you're careful you can pour it back when you're done.  Dripping is truly minimal.  Might find a drop or two from point A to B.

"First off, this thing is huge.  It rests on top of my 5 gallon food grade bucket perfectly.  The double mesh does a good job removing even smaller unwanted particles.  Be prepared to have to rinse hops off of it partway through and potentially re-sanatize during a typical 5 gallon batch. It can clog up to the point where the beer flow stops entirely. If you're not using a sack to steep your grains be ready for a decent amount of weight to this thing when it's full.  You can get by with a smaller one, but I personally felt this was one of those purchases that made brewing my batches notably easier.

"For whatever reason, I have found that this product is harder to find in stores by me lately.  The scented Hydrate version is still readily available, but I choose this one for a reason.  Two areas on my neck have been sensitive to shaving since I was a teenager.  Back then I was using a straightedge razor.  Now I use an electric razor.  I have found that using the latter helps reduce the potential for irritation.  One other safeguard for me has been using mild and/or unscented face wash.  I was using Nivea for Men sensitive face wash for a few years before it disappeared off the shelves by me.  Picked this up as a replacement when it came out and while it is not entirely unscented, it is mild, lathers well, rinses easily, and causes no irritation.

"My wife and I first used Goof Off to remove labels from wine bottles that were being used as part of our centerpieces for our wedding.  It's particularly helpful at removing the glue that inevitably remains after the labels are worked off.  They ended up looking smudged and cloudy when some of that glue was left on there.  More recently I have used it to remove labels from beer bottles that I have been using for home brewing.  Soak the labels fully, let it sit for a few minutes and then work it off with steel wool or a coarse sponge.  It still takes some effort, but this did a way better job of working the labels off then hot water, soap and water, olive oil, etc.  Would definitely recommend it if you've got a stubborn label or glue that won't let up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQ4FQT54OC6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KMOP0M#wasThisHelpful","R3QQ4FQT54OC6U","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I wanted was a well built, portable set to play Washers during the summer.  I accepted two things when placing the order - I was willing to pay more to have it show up on my front porch.  I was not interested in taking the time to try and build one myself.I have owned a set in the past and played heavily on one that a close friend built, so I had some points for comparison.  The simple truth is that you are tossing metal at wood and plastic.  While one set can be a bit more rugged than another, they are going to get chewed up with regular play and time.  The box will inevitably dent and splinter and the washers will get nicked.  That being said, this is what stood out about this particular set to me:Pros - The hooks that hold the boxes together when not in use are great.  A spring is used to keep the hooks from sliding out of place.  This in tandem with the rope handles make this set easy to pop in and out of a car trunk.- Indoor/outdoor carpet received was blue as pictured.  It's a nice touch, albeit largely cosmetic.- PVC for the ""cups"" is much preferred over coffee cans, etc.  These arrived well secured.- The game overall is well crafted.  It has taken the usual knocks this summer and is still in good shape in spite of it.Cons - While the washers have been coated to be zinc and gold in color, and this does serve its purpose, the coating (and/or the effect) is rather light.  I have used RiverCity powdercoated washers in the past and prefer a heavier and brighter coating to help distinguish between washers at a glance.- The base of the boxes have a thin layer of plywood screwed onto them as some reviewers have referenced.  As such, there is some puckering.  I usually end up tossing these down on grass anyway, so it hasn't effected play.Overall, it has met my needs and gives me a solid set to keep in the trunk of my car.  I have no reason to doubt that that I will be using this same set several summers from now.  Seller maintained good communication throughout the transaction and ensured that my item was received in time for a camping trip that I was planning for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5GUOUYOX8I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016BVTF2#wasThisHelpful","R1X5GUOUYOX8I0","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Benebone MINI Peanut Butter flavor is now officially our corgi's 2nd favorite chew toy (bacon flavor wins out for her every time).  She is an aggressive chewer, so we try and keep a handful of different chew toys in rotation at any given time.  It is not dissimilar to a nylabone in terms of the consistency of the material or the effect that aggressive chewing has upon it.  This was one of the first Benebones she had in a few months, so she was more than excited when it hit the floor.  Over the span of several nonstop hours of committed chewing, she was able to do some damage.  What I have noted is that Benebones seems to be a bit less inclined to develop harsh corners or sharp edges than nylabones. Areas of wear are a bit more flaky and softer to the touch. There is always a concern about very small pieces begin eaten during the course of a good chew session (which is inevitable), but if she must, I'd rather they be smooth and pose less of a risk for her intestines and tummy. If I took away each chew toy that exhibited signs of ""damage"", she'd have no toys left. Even with close supervision, she inevitably eats rice sized pieces while she chews.

I opted to purchase it because I have been very happy with both of the Echo short sleeve t-shirts that I own and I wanted something similar for layering.  Great for cool summer nights, wooded hikes, and early fall.  It is quite breathable while offering some basic protection from the sun.

Sometimes you just don't feel like passing a leash back and forth all weekend, but you want them to be able to enjoy the outdoors with you.

She is 25 lbs. and we usually secure the cable to her harness. She is not the type to tug aggressively, but she does get excited when she sees other dogs, squirrels, etc.  She still makes a run sometimes instinctively when that happens, but the cable is secure and the shorter length minimizes the harsh jerk back response you can get when an excitable pup is getting familiar with being tethered.  We only use it occasionally, so rust and wear have not been an issue. Solid construction and secure.

Anyone who has ever used plastic camping stakes before knows that you are always one stubborn rock or root away from a bent, cracked, or shattered stake.  Thankfully I have accumulated a variety of metal stakes from past tents and have them available should these eventually fail me.  Given the size and relative strength of our dog, we have found that using all 6 stakes is rarely necessary.  4 stakes in dry earth has sufficed.  The full impact of darting to greet a passing pup has loosened it slightly, but it has not come close to ever coming out of the ground. Not easy to pry up when they are hammered down all the way.  Have to carefully use the claw of the hammer to work up the base first, then the head of the stakes.  Swivel is smooth, consistent and helps limit tangling.

"I'm not an ultralight backpacker, but I'm also not a huge fan of lugging around an overweight pack.  With things like this you just have to decide for yourself if a pillow is a priority.  For me, it is.  There are plenty of lighter options out there, but I don't know that you'll find a more versatile and comfortable one.  First, it has a built in stuff stack.  It folds into itself and closes securely with a drawstring.  It is notably more compact than my therm-a-rest pillow.  Second, it has a simple, quick, but reliable inflating system.  Push the nozzle to lock it in place.  Pull it out to inflate.  Air goes in and out easily as needed.  Inflate or deflate in a few seconds.  Make no mistake, an inch of memory foam only goes so far.  This is not a Tempur-Pedic by any means, but it is as close to it as you will get on the trail.  Lastly, it has elastic cords underneath that allow you to stuff clothes in for added leverage.  I haven't had to use it personally, but if you have broad shoulders and you're a side sleeper, you might find it useful.  The microsuede cover is removable and washable as well if needed.

"Such a simple tool, but worth every penny on the trail.  When I'm backpacking I bring a few ""2 serving"" Mountain House freeze dried meals.  In the past I've used plastic and titanium sporks as well as an Eat'N tool to dig my way to the bottom of a bag.  Doing so is a very careful dance.  You're usually tired and just really want your food, but you don't want said food all over your hands, your lap, the handle of the spork, your gear, or the ground.  The 2 serving bags just don't lend themselves well to a shorter scoop.  This was a simple but very worthwhile addition for me.  No trouble reaching the corners of the bag whatsoever and it was way easier to control (and avoid) a mess.  Can be attached to a carabiner on your pack through the base or tucked away in a tall side pocket.  Light weight and because it's titanium it cools quickly.

"I have these pants in both the charcoal and the walnut, having picked them up for backpacking trips and hikes.  I would warn that the walnut is notably lighter than the image would have you believe.  I was hoping for a caramel color and got something much closer to a light khaki.They are lightweight, stretchy, and fall somewhere between a slim and standard fit.  They are reinforced in both the crotch and the knees and hold up well on the trail.  Pants are water resistant, quick drying but breathable.  My complaints are minor - the front pockets are a little shallow, the zipper pocket on the right leg is a little deeper than I would want, and the back wallet pocket has a stubby zipper that isn't always the easiest to pull open.  Definitely need a belt for these unless it's a snug fit because the belt loops are thick and the material is lightweight throughout.Overall, they are a very versatile pair of pants to wear on the trail.  They've got some give to them but they are very well constructed.  Fine to wear out casually as well for a laid back evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WS9GF5E93ZOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Q1BCJC#wasThisHelpful","R1WS9GF5E93ZOP","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had these in my pack for a recent multi-day backpacking trip to the Pharoah Wilderness Area near Schroon Lake, NY.  When you've gotta go, you've gotta go.  The top peels off and then sticks back on to help keep the wipes moist.  Advertised as composting down to dirt in 21 days.  Wipes are thin but strong, not unlike a face or hand wipe.  Amount of moisture is comparable as well.  Not lightweight for the ultra-light backpacker, but if you're willing to sacrifice some weight for a few creature comforts, you could certainly do worse than this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UYXSWU8TWT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOBHH0I#wasThisHelpful","R27UYXSWU8TWT5","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the Nemo Espri 2p for a few years and opted to sell it to upgrade to the 2p LE.  Now that I have spent some time with both I actually prefer the older model.  Three primary differences stand out for me.  First, the older 2p utilized jake's feet.  A simple system in which the tent pole snapped securely into each corner.  It made for a quick and reliable set up and take down.  The LE uses a system similar to some MSR tents where the pole ends slide into a metal grommet.  The shape of the end of the pole coupled with the tension help hold it in place.  This serves its purpose, but they don't click out nearly as smoothly during breakdown as the jake's feet did.  I've had to fight with these a few times between the ground cloth, the tent, and the rainfly.  Second, the poles for the 2p were one criss-crossed unit that was secured with plastic clips along the length of the tent and at one point at the top.  It wasn't perfect, but I felt it was easy to set up and folded up tightly to put back in the pole bag.  The 2p LE includes 3 separate poles.  The two main poles slide in along mesh sleeves for the first third of the way before locking in place with plastic clips for the rest.  They're a bit more cumbersome and the curved ends don't always fold in right.  Lastly, there is a shorter pole that goes across the top of the door and secures between two grommets on the sides of the tent.  It's a very snug fit and just doesn't seem necessary as it was absent from the 2p.On the plus side, the tent itself feels a bit more substantial than the 2p and the optional trekking pole vestibule is a big improvement over the 2p version.  Like the 2p, the craftsmanship is solid and the seams, zippers, and stitching are legit.  Similarly, the floor of the tent and ground cloth are a bit thin and the door and vestibules are quick to catch in the zippers.Make no mistake, this is still a well crafted backpacking tent.  But I think it took a few steps back from the 2p in terms of ease of set up and break down which matters when it's raining or you're tired after a long day on the trail.  If you were jumping right into a Nemo tent for the first time, you'd likely be pleasantly surprised.  I just had really high expectations from the 2p and in some ways the 2p LE let me down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IKJ3K0ZPCE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PSTEQU#wasThisHelpful","R29IKJ3K0ZPCE5","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I  purchased a Pacsafe for my honeymoon in Spain.  It is certainly not a guarantee against theft, but for me personally, it was worth the peace of mind that it brings.  It is best suited as a deterrent for opportunistic thieves.  We stayed in reputable hotels in Barcelona, Denia, and Valencia, but when it comes to passports, cash, and technology, I'd rather err on the side of caution.I secured it to immobile bathroom fixtures each time that we left for the day.  It accommodated 2 kindles with thick padded cases, 2 iphones, 2 passports, a camera, cash, and paperwork.  That left it full to the brim.  For our purposes, it was the perfect size.  I disagree on it being cumbersome for travel.  I had it in a 70L backpack with enough clothes, toiletries, and electronics for 11 days in Spain, and I did not even come close to going over any weight limits for my pack.It does arrive stiff, but the bag softens after a few days.  The locking mechanism takes a few tries to get used to and needs a little muscle in the beginning.  I would recommend practicing a few times before you put it to active use.  I never had an instance where the bag could be accessed from the top when it was locked and secured properly.The bag has mesh wire through the body with a cable neck closure, hard plastic catch, and small lock.  It is big enough to hold the necessary valuables, but small enough to tuck under a mattress, a piece of furniture, etc.  I personally secured it and kept it out in the open.  It's one thing to have some money or a piece of electronics disappear after your room has been cleaned, who can prove it anyway?  But it's quite another to have your portable safe cut open.At the end of the day, it probably wasn't needed during our honeymoon.  But I left each day confident that when I returned to my hotel in the evening, my valuables would be there right where I had left them.  Everything made it home safely, and I intend to use the Pacsafe for backpacking and camping trips in the future.  Definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCO1KX4GX7IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RJWGN4#wasThisHelpful","R2UCO1KX4GX7IA","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to pick up a stick after using Beyond Coastal's sunblock last summer.  I was very happy with their product overall, but I found that it inevitably worked its way into my eyes as I sweat.  Thankfully, the face stick provides the same reliable protection without the sting.  It's important to note that this probably isn't for everyone.  It has the consistency of lip balm or vaseline.  Because of that, It can feel thick and greasy on the face.  If you worry about clogging your pores, you might want to keep looking.  That being said, it provides consistent protection, it stays put, it has a pleasant lemon scent, it's very portable, and it won't leave your eyes stinging throughout the day.  For me it was a trade off.  Yes my face feels a little greasy when I'm by the lake or beach, but at least I'm not squinting and rubbing my eyes all day.  Product looks like a stick of deodorant but it's notably smaller than one at .5 oz.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQTLPI3AFCZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UD9EGY#wasThisHelpful","R3PQTLPI3AFCZU","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted lightweight, waterproof, and affordable (it was on sale when I bought it).  This jacket met those requirements and has exceeded my expectations.  I knew I wanted an all purpose jacket.  I work in NYC, and have a 15 minute walk each day from the train station.  I also enjoy camping, backpacking, kayaking, and hiking, so I wanted something I could wear to work, on the weekend, or when I'm on the trail.  I have only had positive experience with Outdoor Research products, so the Helium II ended up on my short list.  I ended up getting the Pewter one which has zippers that fall somewhere between electric green and highlighter yellow.Pros:- Incredibly lightweight.  You forget you're wearing it sometimes.- Water wicks right off of it.  Your upper torso will stay dry.- Zippers are seam sealed.- Hood is adjustable.- Feels like it has a bit of a slim fit to it, overall a sharp looking jacket. Less likely to bunch or ride up while wearing a pack because of that.- Fits true to size.  I'm 5'11 and 177 lbs.  I typically wear a medium and both sleeve and base length were good.- Small pocket above the chest is good for a phone or wallet when it's raining hard.- Quality materials.  It's thin and lightweight with the feel of something far more substantial.Con:- There are no hand pockets.  The chest pocket suffices to keep one or two small items safe, but the hand pockets were definitely missed.  The only thing keeping it from a 5th star for me.  Just easier to use, more convenient access, and it's nice to be able to tuck your hands away while you walk through the pouring rain in midtown.Overall I'm very happy with my choice.Update - 9/2/14 -  I have owned this jacket for over a year now.  I keep it stuffed in the top of my Gregory Z30 Backpack - Men's - Medium - Prussian Blue at all times so I have it on hand whenever the weather turns unexpectedly.  It has held up very well and continues to keep me dry.  Very happy with this lightweight shell!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WIRP7OBEOC1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071JW8TE#wasThisHelpful","R2WIRP7OBEOC1H","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First a disclaimer.  This particular trekking pole vestibule is getting harder to find.  This accessory is for the Nemo Espri 2p, and is not compatible with the similar Nemo Espril 2p LE.  I found that out the hard way and they are discontinued items at this point for Nemo.  That being said, it really is a must have item if you ever intend to have 2 people along with 2 packs in the tent.I have had 2 adult males in the tent several times with Therm-a-Rest air pads.  It's doable, but you'll find you're shoulder to shoulder or touching the edge of the tent.  At least for me, it left no room for two fully loaded packs.  When this vestibule is set up properly, there is room for both.  It utilizes a hiking pole as a central point of stability and then stakes down at two points in the front.  It also snaps onto the rainfly at two points.  What you get is an extended entryway with a separate zipper and velcro closure point.Pros:- Like the tent, it's very lightweight.  You won't notice the addition to your pack at all in terms of space or weight.- It's relatively simple to set up.- Helps keep packs, gear, and shoes dry.Cons:- Like the tent, the material is thin.  It's actually more thin than the rainfly and a slightly darker shade of green.  Like the rainfly, it has a tendency to catch in the zipper.  No holes to speak of yet, but it does take some additional care.- If the wind is whipping and it's raining hard, it's not always a fool proof cover for your packs and gear.  It was not made to go flush with the ground, so some rain can work its way in if it's changing direction and coming in at an angle.  Obviously for the same reason runoff can sometimes find its way to your stuff.  I usually keep my pack on its back with a rain cover on, keep it near the center of the vestibule, and trench lightly if I feel I need to.All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this optional accessory if you have the Nemo Espri 2p.  It helps you get the most out of your tent and provides cover for the stuff that matters when you're out on the trail.  With some simple precautions you should wake up to a dry pack and boots in the morning.Included some images for a visual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP8SMT7B4LM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035ENOXS#wasThisHelpful","R3PP8SMT7B4LM9","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a mid sized notebook to carry around with my Lamy Al-Star fountain pen.  I picked it up primarily for quick notes and passing thoughts.  I have had only positive experiences with Clairefontaine stationary, and this one is no different.  The 6"" x 8.25"" size has worked quite well for me.  It's large enough to offer adequate space while writing, but compact enough to toss easily in a bag on the go.The cover is a pale green color with the Clairefontaine name and logo raised inconspicuously on the corner.  The notebook is cloth bound with linen thread in a darker shade of green.  As it's not a spiral notebook or pad, it does gravitate naturally towards closing until the binding is worn in a bit.  The pages are white with 23 light purple lines on each.  I have been using J. Herbin Lie De The ink and it takes to the pages nicely.  Elastic band is attached to the back cover to keep it securely closed.

"I spent a long weekend backpacking in the White Mountains of NH last summer with a cheap borrowed pack and 55 lbs. of gear.  Towards the tail end of the trip, the hip buckle snapped.  An already uncomfortable pack became much worse.  For the last few miles, my brother and I traded packs intermittently to help ease the load home.  He had an Osprey pack, and it was during those last few miles that I swore a high end pack was in my future.  The difference between the two was night and day.I put in a lot of time researching packs and finally settled upon the Gregory Baltoro when all was said and done.  It's definitely pricey, so it became a birthday gift request between my parents, wife, and brother.  This is an instance where you get what you pay for.  I have every intention of wearing this pack for many long rugged years to come.A lot can be said for this pack, but three simple points have impressed me most:- It helps carry your burden.  I had 60-65 lbs. of gear during my last trip to the Pharaoah Lakes Wilderness region in NY.  I did 17 miles in just over a day during the winter melt and was amazed how well it distributes the weight.  It's rare to be able to say your pack feels far lighter than it actually is.  I'm 5'11"" and 178, so I was comfortably carrying roughly 1/3 of my body weight.- It moves with you.  The hip belt and frame are made to shift with your body.  Whether I was bending over to tighten the laces on my trail runners, reaching back to grab a water bottle, or stepping carefully from rock to rock over a brook, the pack works with me, not against me.- It's well constructed and durable.  Cheap buckles, weak stitching, inconsistent zippers, and faulty straps will all show themselves eventually.  No pack is invincible, but I have been very impressed with the craftsmanship across the board here.  It has given me no reason to believe it won't hold up to many years of abuse.  And if you do unexpectedly run into an issue, it has a lifetime warranty.This may well be the last pack you ever buy.  In my case, I would be very content with that.  It has everything I need and I am truly glad that I opted to go with this pack in the end.  Highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9HNWZX8X5QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045TDTWS#wasThisHelpful","R1L9HNWZX8X5QD","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had this map on hand for a backpacking trip around Pharaoh Lake and Pharaoh Mountain last weekend.  On-line forums, search engines, and web maps are great, but there is no substitute for a detailed and well developed trail map!  It helped considerably pinning down both parking options and trail heads.  It was also great for route planning and shelter options if we needed it.  We experienced high winds and heavy rain during our trip, so I can confirm that the map is indeed waterproof and tear resistant!  The map includes everything from lean tos to boat slips and everything in-between.And on a simple level, these maps serve as a good reminder of just how many trail options there are in the area.  Hope to hit up Tongue Mountain and some of the other trails around the Pharaoh Lake Wilderness we missed in the near future.  Trails do inevitably change a bit with time, but you can toss this in your glove box or pack and rest assured that you'll get a few good years out of it!

"This has been a good choice for backpacking.  First and foremost, it is far more compact than my older thermarest.  I have not gone so far as to try a compression sack for it, but it certainly takes up a reasonable amount of pack space when it is secured with straps.I have been using it with a Nemo Equipment Espri Ultralight Backpacking Tent, so size and space were also an important consideration.  I went with a large, and as a 5'11"" male I'm content with that decision.  The fact that it tapers off down towards the legs saves space and weight.It's comfortable as airpads go, and takes minimal effort to fill.  I find the material and density of this pad is far more agreeable than my older one in terms of folding and rolling it up as needed.  The instructions stress that it should be stored flat and at least partially inflated as often as possible.I can't speak too much on its relative warmth.  While it is supposed to help retain heat, that's a bit harder to gage.  It got down into the high 20's/low 30's when I used it last. There's only so much a sleeping bag and airpad can do.  I was cold at times, but I made it through the night.It's pricey, but if size, weight, and comfort are a factor, you won't do better than this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHXXXK2H5RXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I6UN62#wasThisHelpful","R2NHXXXK2H5RXK","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has one or two shortcomings, but overall this tent comes highly recommended for backpacking trips.  I have used it through some very windy, rainy, and cold nights, so I feel I can give it a fair assessment.Pros:  - It's lightweight and compact, yet it stands sturdy and holds firmly when set up properly.  Compresses like a champ in a compression sack (less the poles and stakes).  - Zip off door and small vestibule offer some customization depending on your needs.  Additional items offered separately offer even more.  - Quick set up time.  The jake's feet and pole structure are great.  Not a big learning curve for using them at all.  Remember black poles go in the back and you're good to go.  - Holds up very well to both high wind and heavy rain.Cons:  - While certainly well constructed, the tent material is definitely thin.  The floor in particular and area around the zipper are the primary concern.  The separate footprint helps, but it has the same core issue.- Because the material is so thin, there has been a number of times where I have had to very carefully coax part of the rainfly back out of the zipper.  Not fun when it's pouring.  No holes to speak of, but it does call for some extra care.  - I have experienced a bit of condensation here and there, but that is the trade off for some ventilation in the rear of the tent.  It also depends which entry system you are using.  I opted to spring for the extras, so I also have the trekking pole vestibule, the pawprint, the foot print, and the gear loft.I have had 2 adult males in the tent twice.  One of those times included 2 therm-a-rest airpads.  It can be done, but the trekking pole vestibule is a must if 1-2 packs will also be on hand.  Certainly tight under those circumstances, so you're either touching the side of the tent or you're shoulder to shoulder.When all is said and done, I think it's a good option when weight, functionality, and flexibility are important.  I trust the tent, and while it isn't perfect, I know I can sleep soundly through whatever nature sends my way.  It's an even better backpacking tent for 2 people with the add ons, but as is, I think it's still a good value for 1 with the occasional 2 tossed in as needed.  Be mindful when buying accessories.  This is the Nemo Espri 2p, not to be confused with the more recent Nemo Espri 2p LE.  It has undergone some dimension changes over the last 3 years and I ended up finding that out the hard way.  The accessories are not interchangeable.  Also, note that that the tent has been discontinued by Nemo.  The trekking pole vestibule for the 2p is getting harder to find because of this.  Make sure you can get any accessories you might be considering before you decide to buy the tent.Included a few images for a visual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZSSXEKEE3O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035ENOSI#wasThisHelpful","R1FZSSXEKEE3O1","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 5th Outdoor Research airpurge dry compression sack.  I have two 15L ones from their last line and two of the 10L.  I decided to go with the 2013 model because they offer a 20L.I have an old bulky Swiss Gear 20 degree sleeping bag that wouldn't fit into either the 10L or the 15L.  For that purpose, this size was a good choice.The changes from the previous model are pretty simple.  The bag is thinner and a bit lighter.  The straps and their buckles are a bit smaller.  The air permeable band towards the base is lime green instead of orange.I would say that the older bags feel a bit more substantial.  This really only comes into play when you are wrestling to fit a bulky item into the sack.  Now that the material is a bit thinner I do find myself taking a bit more precaution when doing so just in case.  Also, ratcheting down the straps usually takes a little extra tugging between the smaller buckles and thinner straps.  Those are really minor inconveniences in the grand scheme of things, but they set the bar high with their last model and I have them as a comparison point to work with.Overall, the positives remain consistent - these compression sacks are durable, easy to use, waterproof, and truly help you make the most of the space that you have to work with. When not in use, they fold up very compactly into themselves and zipper closed. They can always cinch down a little bit further than you think and it's nice knowing your gear will stay dry no matter what when you're out on the trail. Air can go out, but water doesn't come in. They are a little bit pricier than some other options, but they are definitely worth it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNLKSMYSTWXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMAQQY6#wasThisHelpful","R1JNLKSMYSTWXF","A3QC0PB3XGEFLH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QC0PB3XGEFLH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm old enough to remember when TicTacs were introduced, as a neat new breath mint.  That's quite awhile ago now, so change was inevitable, but it seems fair to say that when your new flavor is cherry cola, you're marketing a straight up candy, not a breat product. [Does anyone worried about their breat really seek to have it smell like soda?]That said, these work surprisingly well in conveying that taste.

It was an HP and while it did a nice enough job copying/printing, it frequently lost its wireless connection and the ink was pretty expensive.So, when Vine offered this odd seeming printer, it was worth it just to replace our old one.

Epson's theory here is that by using a different sort of ink delivery system, you can make one batch last up to two years, given normal use.  With three kids in school that would be awesome for us.In turn, they charge a premium price for the actual printer.We set ours up fairly easily.  I got it connected and it has maintained the connection.  The Oldest filled the ink wells, which is a bit messy and potentially very messy.

"There's a very fine piece of reporting hidden within the fake moral/legal quandries that frame this book.The analysis in Mr. Shane's book is even sillier though.  To his detriment, he's a terrific journalist.  So he gives a detailed account of how Awlaki came to make war on his own country, on behalf of al Qaeda, which group Awlaki himself acknowledged the US was at war with. But then Mr. Shane wrings his hands over the legality of killing Awlaki, because he was an American citizen.  Instead, he suggests that the jihadi was entitled to due process.Can't you just see General Meade bellowing down the hill to George Pickett to stop his charge and surrender so that he and his men could face trial?  And that, of course, was on American soil. Not in some corner of the world that lacked any sovereign power for us to deal with.Meanwhile, there's a tremendously amusing theme in the book as the author wonders how President Obama can have gone from a candidate willing to criticize George W. Bush's brusque prosection of the WoT, including even torture, to a commander-in-chief willing to order the remote-controlled murders of Salafist jihadis, despite the lack of courtroom trials.  The answer is that Mr. Obama is actually responsible for national security now, not grandstanding for liberal activists and fellow legal professors.  Responsibility is a tough taskmaster.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUVLL4R70YXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140294#wasThisHelpful","R2CUVLL4R70YXS","A3QVAKVRAH657N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QVAKVRAH657N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's so much to like anout this phone, but then one deal killer : it's not Verizon compatible.A couple years ago I switched to a Samsung droid phone because I wanted a bigger screen, better camera and the better Google integration you get with the OS.Unfortunately, my Galaxy 3 actually has a worse it camera--it was only subsequent iterations that offered a huge upgrade.

"20th Century Fox's big-budget bid to reboot their second most valuable Marvel-based property has come out under a foreboding cloud, one much more menacing than a certain antagonistic cloud from the third act of the largely forgotten Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.  Perhaps prompted in part by stories of on-set conflict and drama, including director Josh Trank's (Chronicle) subsequent firing from an upcoming Star Wars project, critics have torn this film to shreds without mercy or pause.  For around an hour and 10 minutes, I disagreed and enjoyed myself.  Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell inhabit their iconic roles with aplomb.  The tone is serious and even contemplative at certain points, and there are neat, unexpected moments of almost body horror (in one scene right after the four are transformed, Reed believes he has freed his leg from beneath debris, but then realizes it has simply stretched as he crawled away).  Qualms?  Sure—it could use a memorable action sequence or two early on, a few character and storytelling arcs are overly compressed by a one-year-later title card, and they should have shot the Planet Zero scenes in a real desert versus on a green-screen-clad sound-stage—but the film held my attention and even drew me into its characters and their dynamic.However, in the final 30 minutes, Fantastic Four crashes and burns.  Its fall is cleanly and clearly signaled by the reintroduction of Victor von Doom (a previously compelling, brooding Toby Kebbell), now mummified, blandly set on world destruction, and sans the ""Victor von.""  The film bumbles and fumbles and stumbles to an anticlimax, laying on inauthentic eleventh-hour fan service (""It's clobbering time!"" is so unearned here) and completely failing to generate any tension even as we are told the earth is in peril, etc., etc., yawn.  It is almost fascinating how rapidly any character, depth, momentum, and wit completely vanishes during the rushed third act, and it will be interesting to one day learn who is most to blame:  reportedly misbehaved/opinionated hotshot director Trank, a boardroom full of nervously avaricious Fox executives, or another culprit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R413Y4LIGUP2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JPCA1Y#wasThisHelpful","R413Y4LIGUP2Q","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a member of youth-oriented novelist John Green's expansive readership, but I found last year's The Fault in Our Stars to be a very pleasant surprise:  at once a bit hip and very earnest, it features charismatic, well-matched stars and earns its heart-wrenching sentimentality.  Paper Towns, this year's Green adaptation by the same production company, is sadly inferior in almost every way.  The story focuses on Quentin (Nat Wolff), a high-school senior who has long nursed a deep, unrequited love for his popular neighbor Margo (Cara Delevingne), whose moving in he describes as a miracle in an opening voice-over preamble.  When Margo vanishes on the eve of prom and graduation, Quentin begins a type of investigation, desperate to interpret what she left behind in order to discern her location.  The search culminates in a road trip with his best friends, Ben and Radar (Austin Abrams and Justice Smith), as well as a concerned friend of hers, Lacey (Halston Sage).As a film, Paper Towns has one undeniable quality, and it is a potent one:  Wolff is a gifted, welcoming lead with an open face, spot-on comic timing, and an ability to convey neuroses while remaining entirely grounded.  He also generates a nice sense of camaraderie with Abrams and Smith.  Their friendship, the sense of conversational shorthand bred by intimacy and trust, rings true in an otherwise rather false picture.  Supermodel Delevingne is fine, if a bit rigid, but Margo is a disaster of a character:  cruel, indulgent, navel-gazing, overly precocious, and very far from endearing.  The major set piece of the first act (Margo and a nervous Quentin go on a destructive spree, complete with spray paint and dead fish, to punish a cheater who has wronged her) is intended as an empowering and poignant feat of playful disobedience, but it simply grated on me.  ""Just go home, you over-privileged imps,"" I thought.  Even when she is not in a scene, the film is constructed upon Margo, her aura of ""cool,"" and her bland declarations of angst (""paper towns for a paper girl""), and her mediocrity betrays it at several turns.  This dynamic might have proven rewarding in the end if the film were more cynical (or even just a tad forcible) in its investigation of the dream-girl archetype and the way it can warp perceptions, but it never goes anywhere particularly interesting, let alone insightful, on this level.  It is too cute, too soft, too ready to slip into a slow-motion montage set to a contemporary pop song at the drop of a dime.  Genuine moments of anger or longing or misery never enter into the equation.  Every low-key (read:  dull) tension is easily soothed with one-line wisps of pop-psychology wisdom.  A paper movie set in paper towns populated by paper teens.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NKTL44VMXTFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FJH04M#wasThisHelpful","R3NKTL44VMXTFI","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Southpaw, a highly committed and intense lead performance cannot compensate for an uneven, at times even risible screenplay and a general air of the old hat.  A boxing drama so archetypal as to be almost primordial, the story turns on Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light-heavyweight champion whose career and lavish lifestyle evaporate in the aftermath of a violent tragedy involving his wife, played briefly by Rachel McAdams.  Impoverished, separated from his daughter (Oona Laurence), and raging against the world, he focuses anew and trains harder than ever to regain his former status.Every element in Southpaw is ultra-recognizable.  There is the athlete on top of the world who does not respect and control his craft, subsequently falls from grace, and then rises from the ashes, enlightened and enriched.  There is the frequent contrasting of the promoter (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson), avaricious and flashy, with the hard-nosed, soulful trainer (an excellent Forest Whitaker).  There is even an over-the-top antagonist our hero must fight by the end to complete his arc of redemption with a dash of...healing vengeance?  Yes, the wheel is never threatened with reinvention here.  Yet if the performances connect and the writing has integrity and spirit, old-fashioned ingredients such as these can still result in electrifying cinema (as evidenced recently by The Fighter and Warrior).Here, the acting is of a high quality—the star's chiseled physique has already awed the media, and his depiction of his character's slow transcendence of inward fury and self-loathing is poignant, if predictable—but the writing is often excruciating.  Note the way explanatory information is crudely shoehorned in via commentator voice-over.  For instance, the audience is told more than once how Hope hails from a Hell's Kitchen orphanage (surely located on the corner of Rags Avenue and Riches Boulevard), and the serendipitous fact his surname is a synonym for aspirational belief sadly does not go unexploited.  In general, Southpaw is plagued by a confusion of purpose, playing as a revenge melodrama trying to be a profound character study; the pulp pleasure of one pursuit is sanded down without achieving the level of authenticity and depth required to satisfy as the other.  In the moment, yes, it entertains and holds one's attention (the fights are exciting and well-shot, if a tad too tidily organized into round-by-round montages), and Gyllenhaal is undoubtedly striking, but the stale core, the sense of a film halfheartedly assembled with mercenary clichés, is a constant distraction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRPAG50CNMOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FJ3096#wasThisHelpful","R2FRPAG50CNMOU","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though already on the popular-culture radar as a gifted, at times divisive comic and writer due to her series on Comedy Central, Amy Schumer boldly establishes herself as a true-blue film star in the risqué, yet heartfelt Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow, the godfather of the mainstream American comedy in the 21st century.  She plays another Amy, a hard-living, fidelity-averse journalist who is unsure how to react when she develops a genuine romantic interest in an interview subject, an orthopedic surgeon for celebrity athletes (Bill Hader, sweet and subdued).  This is instantly recognizable as an Apatow film.  I say this as a compliment and as a modest criticism:  it runs long, pursuing a few characters and subplots past their natural expiration date, and much of third act functions as a halfhearted soap-opera paean to redemption via domesticity, a crowd-pleasing, if rather square and predictable pet theme of Apatow's.  Other stretches of the film are supercharged with uproarious improvisational flair, however, and Schumer is awarded ample time to create a dynamic, flawed, sexy, and vital heroine, a three-dimensional character both driven and haunted by the depth of her desire and exuberant enjoyment of life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2F0RK0DTDSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U0JWMK#wasThisHelpful","RD2F0RK0DTDSE","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, the Marvel-Disney union scored a gargantuan hit with Guardians of the Galaxy, a bright and zany space opera set in a distant corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the shared space dominated by such flagship heroes as Captain America and Iron Man.  In general, Ant-Man has a similar spirit:  the story of a thief with a heart of gold (Paul Rudd) and his discovery of a suit which can transform a man into an insect-sized soldier, it is a type of outlandish Marvel side note.  And it is an entertaining film, escapist by nature and light as a feather at its best, though it falls short of Guardians of the Galaxy for a few reasons.  The references to the central storyline of the overarching franchise, including a shoehorned-in fight with a second-string Avenger, are more strained; there is a certain cut-rate-serialized-television quality to every scene mentioning S.H.I.E.L.D. or Hydra.  And while Rudd is a charismatic presence, lacing the heartfelt heroism with moments of deadpan humor, he cannot top the magic of the Guardians' combined chemistry even with the help of a game Michael Douglas (exuding cool authority as a curmudgeon slash mentor), a fetching Evangeline Lilly, and a few others.On the plus side, no prior Marvel film's action-and-suspense set pieces have amused, fascinated, and riveted me as much as the ant-scale chases and fights here.  I simply never grew tired of the neat and wondrous spectacle of an ultra-minute Rudd riding atop a winged ant, clinging to a speeding toy train, etc.  And while his antagonistic character is nothing special—a chip-on-his-shoulder corporate fiend who scowls and blandly gestures toward his evil master-plan while awaiting an inevitable third-act vanquishing—Corey Stoll's Darren Cross has the most chic and menacing costume of any cinematic-universe heavy to date, and this instantly renders him more memorable than such dullards as Thor: The Dark World's Malekith or the Winter Soldier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EU44RWJL7AFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DHP3GY#wasThisHelpful","R3EU44RWJL7AFB","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I strongly suspect Self/less will be criticized more for what it is not than what it is.As the film begins, icy real-estate magnate Damian (Ben Kingsley) is diagnosed with cancer and facing the end of his life, beset by fear and regret.  Out of desperation, he agrees to a highly expensive and unlawful medical procedure developed by an enigmatic scientist (Matthew Goode, exuding very British malevolence).  The treatment involves the transfer of his mind into a youthful and reportedly laboratory-grown new body (Ryan Reynolds).  At first, Damian enjoys his extended lease on life and renewed vigor, but disorienting, opaque memories he cannot identify lead him to investigate the true origin of his new form.To be honest, this film does not cover much ground as a piece of cerebral and/or psychedelic speculative fiction, a fact which may dispirit viewers since it is by Tarsem Singh, a music-video veteran and the director of such stylish cult favorites as The Cell and The Fall.  The first-act cognitive switch is utilized as a plot-inciting device, à la the wrong-man dubiety in North by Northwest or amnesia in The Bourne Identity, rather than an invitation to travel inside the human mind and explore its contradictory, ever-shifting complexity.  And though both are in fine form, Kingsley (featured only briefly) and Reynolds do almost nothing to emulate one another, not even in the early scenes in which Damian undergoes physical therapy to become comfortable inside his just-purchased figure.  No trace of the elder English actor's fierce, guarded, stern turn can be found in Reynolds' instantly more charismatic and relaxed performance.However, its shortcomings as science fiction notwithstanding, Self/less is a very well-executed action film.  A certain one-man-against-a-deadly-conspiracy tension builds at a steady and involving pace, and twists and turns are well-placed throughout.  The plentiful sequences of chasing and fighting are staged with spacial clarity and laced with a modest-but-still-recognizable amount of Singh's characteristic visual whimsy.  One key scene, for instance, unfolds in an out-of-the-way industrial field of discarded, decaying Mardi Gras floats and props.  There is also a grounded and low-key charm to the film's set pieces, perhaps because it is a comparatively inexpensive studio release, particularly at this time of year.  It entirely eschews ultra-over-the-top, physics-defying computer-generated wizardry.So, Self/less may bend one's mind only slightly, but it does raise the pulse and warmly satisfy as an escapist summertime jaunt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYAQSPMGT58S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01169SSOI#wasThisHelpful","R1CYAQSPMGT58S","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An intimate, smartly constructed, and, of course, ultimately very sad documentary charting the meteoric rise and drug-and-alcohol-fueled fall of Amy Winehouse, the late British soul singer who electrified the popular imagination, particularly from 2006 to 2008.  Most of the film consists of archival footage (of wildly varying quality on a technical level, of course, but often poignant or startling in its intimacy) set to music or anecdotes recounted by Amy's family and friends, as well as musicians who played with her and record-label executives who signed and promoted her.  To avoid giving the film too conventional an aesthetic, most of the interviewees are not seen, but rather identified with text on the screen.At the height of her fame (during my high-school years), I must admit I thought of Amy first and foremost as a contemporary of a band I adored and obsessed over, the Libertines.  In general, I consider myself a casual, but far from ardent fan of hers, but this film firmly held my attention, so it is definitely not a product only the hardest of hardcore devotees can enjoy.  Early on, it tenderly reveals its subject as a down-to-earth, at times convivial, at times irascible woman who utilized music as a therapeutic outlet for despondency.  And the film is incredibly adept as a stinging indictment of the way the media (from BBC anchorpeople to late-night comedians such as Jay Leno) turned a flesh-and-blood human being's alcoholism, drug abuse, and eating disorder into a perverse carnival because of the distancing dynamic of celebrity.  Many in the audience, myself included, may remember finding a degree of amusement and/or queasy fascination in Amy's ""antics"" (read:  self-destruction) and experience an undeniable pang of shame.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2ELX6ARNDPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UVG49Y#wasThisHelpful","R3S2ELX6ARNDPT","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three years after leaving the world of male striptease behind to start his own company, Michael ""Magic Mike"" Lane (Channing Tatum) finds himself a tad bored and frustrated by mainstream life.  His girlfriend (Cody Horn, unfortunately not featured here in any capacity) left him after a proposal gone awry, and his entrepreneurial spirit has run headlong into day-to-day hardship and tedium.  For a change of pace, he reunites his former Kings of Tampa co-stars (Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Kevin Nash, and Adam Rodriguez) on a summertime road trip to Myrtle Beach; their leader and Faustian father figure Dallas (Matthew McConaughey, understandably absent) has emigrated to Macao, and they plan to give an epic final performance at an exotic-dance convention before moving on.This is a film almost entirely devoid of external conflict or tension:  the Kings of Tampa may harbor slight resentment toward the title character for his abrupt exit, but any negativity is rapidly pacified, and the climactic destination, the strip convention, does not seem to be a championship-game type of competition, but rather a showcase where everyone wins, particularly the female crowd.  Instead, the focus is on athleticism, camaraderie, intimate moments of slice-of-life road-trip whimsy, and a general tendency toward the uplifting and the uptempo (with, of course, a nocturnal twist).  The impact therefore is not as significant as the first film's, which functioned as a cautionary drama and a contemporary economic parable delivered via the ecstasy and camp of a dance film, but the sequel is still a worthy and distinctive ride.The cast instantly conjure an authentic and electrifying chemistry.  The dance sequences are a grandly choreographed blend of the creative, the erotic, and the madcap.  (Manganiello steals the show in this department, first with an impromptu convenience-store dance to put a smile on the face of a weary cashier and then with an elaborate, bondage-themed performance partly set to ""Closer"" by Nine Inch Nails.)  The picturesque parade of Southern landscapes and sultry nightclub spaces are photographed with characteristic mood and precision by Steven Soderbergh, who also serves as an executive producer and editor, but cedes the directorial chair itself to long-time protégé Gregory Jacobs.  The only notable flaw in this easygoing, crowd-pleasing enterprise is a shoehorned-in ""female lead"" played rather blandly by the very beautiful Amber Heard; she pops up throughout as if shadowing the Kings of Tampa on their journey, has a short temper (she is a photographic -artiste- railing against the inauthentic in a very inauthentic way), and shares lengthy, momentum-murdering conversations with Tatum's Mike which never ring true or spring to life with any genuine romantic charm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LY7L3WIB4M87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NDZEX6#wasThisHelpful","R1LY7L3WIB4M87","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Terminator—so compact, frightening, and inventive—and Terminator 2: Judgment Day—a vastly ambitious sequel with game-changing digital F/X—remain this iconic franchise's dual zenith, but the fifth outing, almost-reboot Terminator Genisys, is far and away the best entry of the post-James Cameron era, and I am a bit perplexed by the scathing notices critics have given it.  The story begins at the same point as the original, and it is a scenario so deeply ingrained in popular culture as to be a type of modern myth:  Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), a soldier in a future war waged by man against machine, time travels to the 1980s to save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), the mother of humanity's future savior, John (Jason Clarke), when she is targeted by a robotic assassin disguised in flesh (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  Except this time—""except this time"" (or perhaps ""except in this alternate timeline"") is this film's maxim—Kyle finds a Sarah already combat hardened and under the protection of a benevolent terminator slash father figure (also Schwarzenegger).""It destroys canon we invested in three decades ago!"" people have cried.  And it does, perhaps, but this did not disturb or upset me:  time-travel cinema, and the Terminator saga in particular, is a strange and poor bedfellow for devotees of conundrum- and paradox-free continuity, and I sensed a nerdy, potent joy in director Alan Taylor's recreation and subsequent reinterpretation of key moments and visuals from the first film.  In general, Taylor stages crisp and exciting action sequences.  They are very much of their time compared to Cameron's more grim and grounded chases and fights—the chaos is dialed to eleven, and it can be hard to remember our heroes are meant to be in peril rather than on a spectacular joy ride—but there are still a great many flesh-and-metal flourishes, the ones which remind us why we return again and again to Terminator lore.Schwarzenegger has a grand time returning home to his flagship property.  The one-liners connect, even if we groan a bit as we smile.  He is still a commanding and cool force in action, including fighting himself at one point.  And he is even a tad poignant as he insists he is ""old, not obsolete,"" referring to his character (the human-flesh shell ages faster than the computer inside) and his own status as a bodybuilder turned international film star turned politician turned actor again, returning to a much-changed pop-culture landscape.  Game of Thrones co-star Emilia Clarke also impresses, replacing Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  Her tough-yet-tender portrayal is of a Sarah in flux, halfway between the sweet, naive, big-haired student of the first film and the ferocious mercenary of Terminator 2.  Jason Clarke exudes a convincing sense of authority as John Connor and nicely subverts it later—the screenplay's zany time-bending requires more than the heroic brooding Christian Bale brought the role in Terminator Salvation—and recent Academy Award champion and veteran character actor J. K. Simmons contributes a touch of scene-stealing pep as a California detective, another member of the roster of characters who realize the veracity of the stories of apocalypse and time travel and are regarded as unstable for their trouble.  Only Jai Courtney, capable, but unspectacular as Reese, is notably miscast.  Michael Biehn played the character in such a dynamic way:  he seemed at once courageous, fatigued, melancholy, and verging on mad as a soldier largely raised underground and in constant fear.  Courtney's Reese is far more generic:  a standard-issue hero, too chiseled and without haunted eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8IJT9OAHDJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R40EUY#wasThisHelpful","RR8IJT9OAHDJR","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hungry Hearts is an odd and at times unwieldy film, but also an extremely disquieting and hypnotic one.  It has the most misleading opening sequence imaginable:  engineer Jude (Adam Driver) and Italian transplant Mina (Alba Rohrwacher) are briefly held captive in the restroom of a Chinese restaurant when the door will not open.  He is nervous.  She is aloof.  They call for help.  They laugh.  They warm to one another.  Romantic comedy, right?  Wrong.  The next few cuts jump forward in time.  They sleep together.  She decides to stay with him in America rather than move with her job.  She is pregnant.  They wed.  The film reveals its true nature during her pregnancy.  She briefly believes the baby may be an ""Indigo child,"" a New Age conception of a special or even supernatural being.  She abhors hospitals and their technology, longing instead for a natural alternative.  Her troubled nature only intensifies once their son is born.  She rigidly controls his diet to the point of stunting growth, and she refuses to let him outside.  Frightened and hesitant, Jude tries to respect his wife's belief system while also championing his ailing son, but the situation grows more and more volatile as the months go by.It is a horror story for the anti-vaccination generation.This film in general is vastly indebted to vintage Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  The slowly mounting, ambiguity-centric suspense is largely derived from the claustrophobia of the apartment where much of the action unfolds; as Jude and Mina spiral further into crisis, many scenes are shot with a depth-and-space-contorting fish-eye lens, turning their domestic sphere into a type of nauseating madhouse.  It is, to be honest, a rather heavy-handed exaggeration of Polanski's confined-places cinema, but the impact (the creep factor) is undeniable.  And the lead performances are both strong.  Driver, known for his comic-and-neurotic screen presence, slips easily into a more dramatic role, nicely playing the character's gradual evolution from guarded, sincere concern to near frenzy.  And Rohrwacher is downright wrenching, exuding a frightening blend of derangement and parental exhaustion.  The flayed-nerve nature of her turn, both on physical and emotional levels, almost matches Charlotte Gainsbourg's bold and searing submission to Lars von Trier's vision in Antichrist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RHDK76O4W26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXFPU8K#wasThisHelpful","R39RHDK76O4W26","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Child 44, based on a popular airport novel by Tom Rob Smith, is a big, dowdy, lumbering dud.  It almost registers as a curiosity, an out-of-time anti-Soviet nightmare featuring many highly respected actors and which clearly cost a great deal to produce.  Any expended funds shall not be recouped.  The storyline is confused and labyrinthine.  The advertising portrays it as the story of a child predator rampaging through a 1950s Soviet Union in which no comrade will admit murders, deemed a symptom of capitalism, ever transpire in Stalin's paradise.  Except, of course, for one strong-arm secret policeman, Leo (Tom Hardy), for whom the investigation raises intense, but ultimately productive moral and political quandaries.  And this is, in a way, the central thrust, but, wow, can this film move laboriously and lose focus.  There are so many dour subplots, incoherent transitions, and poorly defined tensions, as if they ballooned a 90-minute picture with extraneous notes of self-importance or crudely cut a season of television down to feature length.  The child murders only come to fore an hour into a film lasting a numbing, feels-even-longer 2 hours and twenty minutes, and the identity of the culprit is revealed with the grace of a particularly uninspired episode of Criminal Minds.The gargantuan problem of storytelling and thematic opacity, as well as lax pacing, is compounded by a wildly ugly aesthetic, full of brown-on-grey medium shots and, during chase and fight sequences, disorienting editing.  (It is appropriate the story is resolved with three central characters mud wrestling in what could be a pit of diarrhea.)  Also rather ugly?  The rogues' gallery of questionable Russian accents, with performers of many nationalities—Australian, English, French, Swedish—trying their mouthful-of-borscht best with distracting and inconsistent results, although even in a film as bad as this, Hardy remains a charismatic and imposing presence.

"The latest in a long line of adaptations of the seminal novel by Gustave Flaubert, French-born director Sophie Barthes' (Cold Souls) English-language Madame Bovary is a compact and often gorgeous rendering, though definitely more of a cerebral experience than a red-hot story of sensuality and tragedy.  In a rather curious misfire, Barthes opens her film at the end, with a poisoned Emma Bovary (Mia Wasikowska) racing through the forest, tightly clutching her side and then falling to the ground.  It is an overly literal and revelatory way to begin a film already defined by its air of inevitable despair and doom.  Then, however, an elegant and well-crafted depiction of tedious provincial life emerges, with several moments of genuine visual poetry, particularly ones contrasting Emma's increasing flamboyance with her pastoral environment and the way the disparity insulates and misguides her.Barthes completely foregrounds the title heroine (anti-heroine?), excising the Flaubert novel's early shared focus on Charles (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), her doting, but unimaginative husband.  The film sprints behind her as she ends her authoritarian education at a convent, weds, and moves to live with her husband in an out-of-the-way hamlet very far from the Paris she dreams of.  Wasikowska, of whom I am an enormous fan, is dynamic in the lead role.  She exhibits sympathy for her character's plight, but is also unafraid to explore her sinister side:  tendencies toward greed, self-destruction, and vanity which emerge as she pursues an empty and unrealistic type of fulfillment.  (It is a bit of a shame this adaptation ignores the character of Berthe, Charles and Emma's daughter, denying the star the chance to play provocative scenes of domestic malaise further complicated by maternal discontent.)  The other performances are largely capable, though no one comes close to eclipsing Wasikowska.  Among the peripheral cast members, Rhys Ifans is best, stealing a few scenes as a slyly malevolent fashion merchant, Monsieur Lheureux, who praises and smiles as he spins inescapable webs of debt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLC6RPKDTQ9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRMZR2S#wasThisHelpful","RLLC6RPKDTQ9D","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The four-year-old Insidious franchise continues with an uneven, but still entertaining and, at times, very creepy third entry.  A prequel set a few years before the events of the prior films, the storyline turns on high-school student Quinn (Stefanie Scott), whose bid to contact the spirit of her deceased mother instead attracts the attention of a dangerous supernatural entity:  an emaciated, slithering demon whose presence is announced by labored breathing and oily footprints.  She and her bewildered father, played rather blandly by Dermot Mulroney, turn to franchise mainstay Elise (Lin Shaye) for aid, though she is reluctant to use her psychic power after the suicide of her husband and several foreboding encounters with another franchise mainstay, the spirit of a murderous woman in a sable bridal gown (or rather a man in drag if I my memory of Insidious: Chapter 2 serves).Though he is still credited as a producer and even has a brief cameo in the first act, James Wan is replaced here as director by frequent collaborator Leigh Whannell, the writer of the prior Insidious films and a consistent member of the ensemble cast as one-half of a comic-relief ghost-hunting duo.  This is Whannell's directorial debut, and he proves an adept replacement for Wan, a well-regarded stylist now at the helm of mega-budget tent-pole releases.  There are many suspenseful sequences and nicely macabre flourishes throughout, and the antagonist (teased at first in the shadow-enshrouded distance, waving) is the most grotesque and menacing member of the Insidious rogues' gallery to date.  It is the screenplay where problems arise.  The film has an unusual, distracting tendency to introduce and then drop peripheral characters:  Quinn's best friend, a neighbor with a crush on her, and, most strangely, her brother, a character who vanishes for long stretches and never seems overly aware of  or frightened by the situation in his home.  Why even include him and the others in the first place?  The climax, involving, of course, a fateful trip into the world of lost and malevolent spirits (the so-called Further), is undercut by a predictable and saccharine deus ex machina.  And there is even a degree of confusion as to who the protagonist of the film is:  fresh face Quinn and the returning Elise are both brave, sympathetic, well-acted female characters, so it is hard too complain a great deal, but there is a sense they are competing for the limelight, with the film losing interest in the longing and torment of Quinn as it becomes more invested in the question of whether Elise will embrace her fate as a type of paranormal avenger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GM3N4M2M2KME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT8SCSG#wasThisHelpful","R2GM3N4M2M2KME","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As extreme seismic activity tears California asunder, combat veteran and rescue-helicopter pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) tries to save his estranged wife and daughter; his point-A-to-point-B adventure comprises a series of problems to be solved and spectacular expanses of chaos to be navigated.  San Andreas is an old-fashioned and well-executed disaster film.  Perhaps it simply found me in the right mood, but I enjoyed the ride.  Yes, it is harebrained and at times lands with a thud—a climactic shot of an American flag grandly unfurling as the sun sets is groan-inducing—but the set pieces are realized with muscular showmanship and convincing computer-generated imagery, with the mega-budget spectacle (the tsunami!) nicely complemented by moments of ground-level, in-the-moment suspense involving trapped legs and crowds of looters.  And the predictable domestic melodrama (the earthquakes, of course, prove a mediating force, elevating the righteous and the stoic among the principal cast while revealing and punishing the amoral and the cowardly) is performed with surprising conviction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357E799ZCQQSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGO1FQE#wasThisHelpful","R357E799ZCQQSR","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"True Story is a restrained and slowly burning, yet very riveting meditation on the point at which crime and journalism intersect (the true-crime genre pioneered by Truman Capote with In Cold Blood) and its inherent ethical conundrums.  Jonah Hill portrays Michael, an ambitious and widely admired reporter whose star rapidly fades after it is revealed he conflated and toyed with details and personalities to enhance a prestigious cover story.  James Franco co-stars as Christian, an Oregon man charged with the brutal murder of his wife and three children.  Upon his arrest in Mexico, Christian tells the authorities he is Michael (he later claims to be a fan), and this inexplicable decision unites the two men, both cynics and fabulists in one way or another.  Christian agrees to tell his side of a tragic tale, and Michael spots a complicated and even nauseating, but viable chance to revive his career in nonfiction.  Previous comic collaborators Hill and Franco are in fine dramatic form, and their lengthy scenes together (the who-is-using-whom? dance of deductive questioning and macabre intellectual seduction) almost play as a dialed-down, more melancholy version of The Silence of the Lambs, which is perfectly welcome.  The film is at once thoughtful and quietly creepy, and it generates a considerable amount of suspense without becoming garish or sacrificing its intelligence and integrity.  Very satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24QA9EGSOR0OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYXV776#wasThisHelpful","R24QA9EGSOR0OV","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Directed by Brad Bird, the Disney film Tomorrowland features an extraordinary level of Jules Verne- and World's Fair-indebted visual spectacle.  The storyline turns on Casey (Britt Robertson), a rebellious and whip-smart teenager who, after spending a night in jail for trying to halt the demolition of a NASA launch pad, finds an unusual pin among her belongings.  When she touches it, she is transported to the title futuristic metropolis, a place of flying men and swirling hydroponics as marvelous as it is inexplicable.  Her research regarding the origin of the pin leads her to the home of a reclusive inventor (George Clooney) and into the center of a dangerous conflict over the fate of the strange utopia she briefly glimpsed.The conflict, with its squads of murderous robots and high-energy chases (including a hypnotic stopover at the Eiffel Tower), doubles as an ideological feud:  pragmatic hope versus fatalism, and the film's overt argument for the former at times lapses into didactic strong-arm sloganeering, but the general air of heartfelt, nostalgic enthusiasm mostly compensates.  And every other element in front of and behind the camera is top-notch or close to it.  Bird is clearly engaged with and inspired by the material, and this is my favorite film of his since the masterful Ratatouille.  It is a lengthy picture, but well-paced and punctuated with delightful moments of action, humor, mystery, suspense, and even a highly unconventional, almost tragic romantic subplot which is hard to explain and could have registered as creepy, but is instead a thought-provoking rumination on the stinging, transfixing impact of first love.Robertson is a decently down-to-earth presence as the resolute heroine, though the character (a proxy for the audience and, by extension, a catalyst for explanatory dialogue) is never the film's most arresting element.  Movie-star-among-movie-stars slash sexiest-man-alive Clooney challenges himself by playing against type, subduing his usual debonair charm to portray an aging man consumed by grief and resentment, but not entirely beyond redemption.  It is a persuasive and stately piece of acting.  However, the most memorable player in the ensemble is one featured in none of the film's advertising:  Raffey Cassidy, a fresh-faced English girl reportedly aged 12 or 13.  She is sensational as Athena, a robot disguised as a child whose primary protocol involves finding the world's best and brightest and recruiting them to contribute to Tomorrowland.  Cassidy expertly draws on the ambiguity of the role—how much of her beguiling old-soul sentience is a programming illusion?—to create an imaginative and tantalizing science-fiction character, and she more than holds her own against seasoned veteran Clooney, with whom she plays a couple intense and poignant scenes.  Their bond, including a final scene which brought a tear or two to my eyes, is ultimately more powerful than the world-in-peril drama.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GDE5ZQ35TRFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2DPYQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3GDE5ZQ35TRFJ","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Films often run long to a fault.  However, they can also run short, and Slow West is a prime example.  The story of an eager, youthful Scotsman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who has come to the untamed American frontier in search of people from his past and his hesitant bond with another traveler, a taciturn bounty hunter (Michael Fassbender), the film is in many ways a gem:  an atmospheric, at times cynical, at times romantic Western fable.  Imagine the antique-epic aesthetic of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford coupled with the wryly outlandish sensibility of Wes Anderson and buoyed by well-matched stars, with Fassbender particularly having a grand time toting guns, riding horses, and perfecting his Clint Eastwood-style thousand-yard stare.  Each shot is framed just so, lit to sumptuous golden-hour perfection, and adorned with authentic period detail.  Sadly, sans end credits, Slow West lasts around an hour and 20 minutes, perhaps even a tad less.  We crash headfirst into the ending and wish there were far MORE, or at least I did:  more chasing and gun-fighting sequences, more character development (including for Ben Mendelsohn's nicely snaky, yet still thinly sketched heavy), and more time in general in this highly distinctive and slightly madcap cinematic vision of the Old West.  The third act's bittersweet, unforgiving violence would hit even harder if the road leading there were longer and more winding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KTBBLNFSRIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOX8HKK#wasThisHelpful","R17KTBBLNFSRIK","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a dialed-down, quietly moving dramatic performance in Maggie, a desaturated American-Gothic indie.  The film turns on the idea of a zombie epidemic as a metaphor for end-of-life care:  the Schwarzenegger character, salt-of-the-earth farmer Wade, watches as his infected teenage daughter (Abigail Breslin) slowly decomposes and loses her mind, and he must decide when it is time to either end her life himself or have her ""quarantined,"" a euphemism here for government-run euthanasia programs.  This is not a perfect film:  at times, its ultra-solemn aesthetic feels overdetermined and self-conscious, as if we are being reminded with a firm hand how Very, Very Artistic and Serious the proceedings are.  However, the sad-eyed performances ultimately infuse the film's sense of tragic inevitability with emotional authenticity, particularly Schwarzenegger's low-key and highly committed depiction of a man torn between the-world-today pragmatism and his deeply ingrained paternal instinct.  There are also standout scenes in which the creepy and the melancholy potently intermix, one involving a forest encounter with an undead father and daughter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HB21HPUNRL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBTG85S#wasThisHelpful","R22HB21HPUNRL1","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Introverted computer programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is recruited to visit the palatial and secluded mountainside home of his wealthy employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac).  His enthusiasm is palpable, but the purpose of the trip is shrouded in mystery.  Only in person does Nathan reveal Caleb is to interact with and test the quote-unquote humanity of Ava (Alicia Vikander), a female android with artificial intelligence.  As the test nears its conclusion, wonder turns to anxiety and suspicion as Nathan forms a profound relationship with his largely hospitable, yet inscrutable host's state-of-the-art creation.  With Ex Machina, his welcome directorial debut, respected novelist-turned-screenwriter Alex Garland proves he is an inspired and muscular stylist as well as a top-notch storyteller.  This is a perfect science-fiction film or very, very close to it.  The type of film fans of the genre always hope to chance upon, it is riveting from the start, moving at a confident and steady pace, slowly and smartly building an atmosphere of unease, and its dual purposes (to tease the mind with ideas, to entertain as a piece of exciting and stylish cinema) complement rather than overpower one another.  The home where most of the action unfolds is a modern space at once beguiling and icy, similar to inhabitant Ava, and its reflective surfaces and sharp lines heighten the overall sense of enveloping isolation experienced by fish-out-of-water Caleb.  The performances are arresting, too.  The arguable standout is Isaac.  He upends expectations by playing his role, a type of contemporary mad scientist, with colorful, outsize virility rather than intellectual severity.  Because he seems both highly charismatic and entirely dangerous, the mystery regarding the goal and the ideology of Nathan (indeed, the simple question of how much he can be trusted at any given moment) is much harder to unravel and predict.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AH0OT682PH54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWPQNJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2AH0OT682PH54","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At its best, Spring is a hypnotic and unique genre fusion:  a dreamily romantic creature feature.  The storyline begins with the death of protagonist Evan's (Lou Taylor Pucci) mother.  After years of caring for her, he is adrift:  despondent, unsatisfied with his job in a bar, and pursued by the police after a fight.  He escapes to Italy, and a popular cinematic male fantasy begins to play out:  he finds an idyllic job on a farm with a wisdom-dispensing old man (Francesco Carnelutti) and falls in love with Louise (Nadia Hilker), an Italian student as beautiful as she is enigmatic.  However, the audience realizes long before Evan there is more to Louise than meets the eye:  she gives herself injections to halt transformations into a bloodthirsty and grotesque creature.  The film sidesteps genre conventions by continuing to respect both characters and their bond; it elicits fear and sympathy for both him (will he become her victim?) and her (can she overcome the beast within?).  Unfortunately, the tantalizing blend of youthful romance and body horror becomes less interesting as the film becomes less coy.  Its early and playful focus on atmosphere and suspense gives way to overly verbose explanation and greeting-card sentimentality.  Also, though they excel at composing lushly Gothic widescreen images, writing-directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are nowhere near as adept as writers.  There is often a distracting, Kevin Smith-lite vulgarity to the dialogue, and soul-baring lines intended as earnest and poignant can instead be groan-inducing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI1WF9WWS7XT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBRJ6MA#wasThisHelpful","RI1WF9WWS7XT5","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After five three-hour films, thirteen years, hundreds of millions of dollars spent and earned, seventeen Academy Awards, and thousands of miles traversed on-screen, director Peter Jackson's iconic, J. R. R. Tolkien-derived Middle-earth saga comes to a decidedly uneven end with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the third and final prequel to The Lord of the Rings.  There is no way around the truth, cold and hard as it is:  this is the worst of the six films.  In fact, as a fan (though not a particularly ardent one), it is the only entry in the series I do not rate as a satisfying picture.  So much goes wrong.  One flaw is predictable:  to the give the second film, The Desolation of Smaug, a grim, dramatic, and abrupt to-be-continued ending, the start of this film was sacrificed a year ago.  So, it begins.  Infuriated dragon Smaug is laying waste to a town of men.  We as an audience are disconnected, disoriented.  The dragon dies and becomes an almost instant afterthought.  The desolation of Smaug is over.  Shrug.  Also becoming an afterthought here, sadly, is title character Bilbo Baggins, Shire-born master burglar.  The wonderful Martin Freeman is still a charismatic, grounded, slightly mischievous, and ultimately noble presence in the role, but he is often crowded to the edge of the frame and the story.  The Hobbit now has to remind itself to include the hobbit.In his stead are vast, brutal, ambitious, and interminable sequences of combat:  elf versus dwarf, dwarf versus goblin, man versus orc, and so on and so forth times infinity.  It becomes an exhausting spectacle, and moments of genuine excitement and ferocity are too infrequent.  The limited scope is also dispiriting.  The armies fight outside the Lonely Mountain.  They fight in the town a mile from the Lonely Mountain.  They fight on a glacier a mile from the town near the Lonely Mountain.  There is the dampening sense here of a film racing and screaming and starting fires, but never moving anywhere particularly fast despite the outward pomp and instances of indulgent fan service, including absurd, please-cheer displays of aerobatic daring by Orlando Bloom's returning Legolas, no longer as sexy and dynamic as he used to be.  The film is also curiously disinterested in resolving certain subplots (despite a scenery-devouring cameo by Cate Blanchett, the confirmation of Sauron's impending return to power plays more as a rushed obligation than a foreboding revelation) or saying a proper farewell to a catalog of characters unique to the prequels, such as barely-glimpsed shape-shifter Beorn.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI31713CSIVPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3DODWI#wasThisHelpful","RI31713CSIVPX","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A low-key, tender, and, in the end, disturbing story of female adolescence set in a time and place not often depicted in cinema:  post-Soviet Georgia circa the early 1990s.  The overcast instability of the environment, with its frantic bread lines, civil conflicts, and general atmosphere of potential doom, lends extra fascination and immediacy to the subdued story of teenage best friends (Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria, both graceful and natural) and the cruelties visited upon them by ambivalent adults, chauvinistic male peers, and the dire economic and political state of their country.  Among these cruelties is an act of so-called ""bride kidnapping,"" which is troubling in and of itself, but even more gut-wrenching are the resigned responses of people who should protest.  The film's cinematographer is Oleg Mutu, known for his European Film Award-winning lensing of the monumental 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.

"This espionage film comes out under a significant and foreboding cloud.  Removed from highly regarded director Paul Schrader's control by the financiers during post-production, it is a film disowned by its creators.  Schrader, leading man Nicolas Cage, co-star Anton Yelchin, and executive producer Nicolas Winding Refn posted pictures of themselves online wearing t-shirts emblazoned with their contracts' non-disparagement clauses.  An interesting form of social-media protest:  turning a contractual obligation not to criticize a film into a vehicle of criticism.As for the finished film (product?) regarded apart from the context of its production as much as one can, it is captivating, yet uneven.  For every two virtues, there is a blemish, and it is frustrating.  Cage, exuding exhaustion and his hair greyed, delivers one of his finest performances of recent years as a CIA veteran diagnosed with degenerative frontotemporal dementia.  As his mind and body begin to betray him, he races to tie the most haunting loose end of his career:  finding and punishing an elusive radical who nearly tortured him to death two decades ago.  Suspense films of this nature often find their protagonists racing against time in one way or another (defuse a bomb, save an abducted child).  Here, he is racing against mortality, and it is a poignant twist.  There is a fantastic scene early on in which he delivers a speech to the agency's new recruits, at first chastising them for embracing an ugly beast such as the CIA, with its in-house political gamesmanship and questionable post-9/11 record, but then praising them for heeding the call of public service despite any cynical misgivings.  As performed by Cage, the speech seems two-thirds sentimental bull, one-third deeply felt and pleading.Though the actor is always charismatic, the Anton Yelchin character is a bit inexplicable.  I never entirely believed this fresh-faced agent would sacrifice his career and maybe even his life to help his mentor with an extrajudicial manhunt.  He seems a contrived inclusion to give the often despondent and unstable antihero a vigorous, youthful, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit-esque counterpart.  And the film simply falls apart in its final 20 minutes, an unsatisfying and rushed blur of gunfire, gory vengeance, and inadequate lunges toward catharsis.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDGXYC0N4U84H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3GKGFO#wasThisHelpful","RDGXYC0N4U84H","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In fairy tales, the forest is often a dangerous and deviant space populated with symbolic highwaymen, witches, wolves, and other disruptions of purity.  The new Disney film Into the Woods (adapted from a beloved Broadway musical of which I have almost no knowledge) aims to explore this concept by blending various bedtime-story icons, such as Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Red Riding Hood and her Wolf.  However, in my minority opinion, it is entirely inert and a shameful failure.  I despise this film.  It bored me to tears, and its pretentious gestures toward ""deconstructing"" fairy tales to reveal the inner admonishments and warnings are obvious and underdeveloped at best.  I can only praise it on three counts.  Chris Pine delivers a hilarious and refreshing performance, nicely lampooning the cartoon brawn and dashing pomp of Prince Charming archetypes.  Emily Blunt is also fine; her character is a mite bland and retrograde, but Blunt plays her with characteristic poise and conviction.  And there is a single fantastic song, ""Agony,"" featuring the aforementioned Pine as he tears open his shirt to reveal his chiseled chest and falls to his knees to convey the depth of his romantic longing for Cinderella.Sondheim devotees can crucify me, but I did not find any of the other songs memorable or even particularly tuneful.  Point a gun at my head, and I could not recite a lyric or whistle the melody from any of them a few hours after watching the film.  Many of the actors seem uncomfortable in their roles or at least unsure how to play them, broadly drawn as they are.  Meryl Streep will receive an obligatory Academy Award nomination for her camp turn as a maternal witch, but her scenery-devouring theatrics are unspectacular.  There is no sense she is having quantifiable fun or pushing herself as a performer.  It is just a seasoned pro loudly overacting in even louder wigs.  And it is hard to imagine a key performance in a major motion picture duller than MacKenzie Mauzy's personality-free turn as the witch's (stolen at birth) ""daughter,"" the long-long-haired Rapunzel.  Anna Kendrick also flounders as a muted, indistinct Cinderella.Director Rob Marshall does an awful job tying the various fairy-tale references and themes together.  There is never a sense this is a single picture depicting a single world nor is there substantial momentum.  The film registers as an overlong, lopsided swarm of halfhearted and unfinished vignettes.  There is also a dearth of visual imagination on Marshall's part.  This project invites pop, spectacle, and a playful visual eye, but he proves a wan non-stylist at every turn.  Much of the action unfolds on the same half acre of studio-lot woodland.  One ongoing subplot involves Cinderella thrice fleeing the prince's ball in fear he will realize her low social standing and fall out of love, but never once does Marshall's camera dare enter the ball itself.  He is satisfied filming the steps again and again.  Nor are we treated to even a single tantalizing glimpse of the land of the giants.  Just closeups of those magic beans.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VJ0FVJBO2UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHUSN0#wasThisHelpful","R14VJ0FVJBO2UI","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though few saw it, particularly during its brief theatrical run, I adore Angelina Jolie's directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, a poignant and visceral drama set during the Bosnian War.  In my opinion, it is one of the finest and most interesting directorial debuts ever by a film star and, as a subtitled document of sexual violence during genocide, revealed Jolie's courageous and empathetic nature behind the camera.  She has now directed a second film, Unbroken, and once again excels.  It is much larger scope and more polished than In the Land of Blood and Honey, and not as impacting, but it without a doubt further solidifies her superior directorial ability.Her subject here is Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, an Italian American of the Greatest Generation with a spectacular life story.  He is played by promising British actor Jack O'Connell in a charismatic and focused performance.  Louie first rose to prominence as an Olympic long-distance runner.  His lightning-fast final lap during the 5000-meter run in Berlin earned him a certain degree of celebrity, as well as a brief personal meeting with an admirer by the name of Adolf Hitler (an encounter not dramatized in this film).  Later, during the Second World War, he served in the United States Army Air Forces and survived over 40 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean with minimal food and water after a plane crash.  ""Rescued"" by a Japanese patrol, this bid for survival gave way to another nightmare:  two years of degradation, servitude, and torture in various prisoner-of-war camps.  (Japanese guitarist and songwriter Miyavi, with his metro-sexual and slightly alien presence, steals scenes as Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Watanabe, or ""the Bird,"" a sadist who engineered many of Louie's abuses and was later cited by General Douglas MacArthur as one of the most egregious at-large war criminals of the Pacific theatre.)This film exudes earnest fascination with Louie and respect for his wartime resilience.  This is no generic awards-season studio product, but a deeply felt paean to the late athlete and soldier by Jolie.  To be honest, it is a borderline gushing hagiography, indulging in the nearly mythic--dare I say Herculean?--quality of his saga, though Jolie and her head-turning private legion of prestigious writers (Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson) include a few evenhanded and bluntly uncomfortable moments so as to not completely canonize their subject.  In one, an ailing bombardier inquires if he will die soon, perhaps tonight.  Louie ponders the question and rather flatly replies, ""Maybe.""  The film holds viewers' hands a tad tightly in its positioning of Louie's torments and trials as a stations-of-the-cross march toward faith and transcendence--there is literal sermonizing early on as a priest expounds on the significance of loving thine enemy--but resistance to the inspiration and uplift proves futile, particularly with so many perfectly executed and truly exciting set pieces, shot by inimitable cinematographer Roger Deakins with an equal eye for verisimilitude and old-fashioned, David Lean-style spectacle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYDNJI795MMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTDCLM#wasThisHelpful","RQYDNJI795MMT","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very small, but very rewarding German film which wears its directorial influences—Woody Allen, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Linklater—on its sleeve, but honors them rather than registering as a pale imitation.  Set in Berlin and photographed in attractive B&W, the film consists of day-in-the-life vignettes involving a friendly, but desultory law-school dropout and the various idiosyncratic people he encounters, including his emasculating father, a now-sexy woman he used to taunt at school for her obesity, and an elderly gentleman haunted by his childhood memory of Kristallnacht.  The film is often very amusing, expertly drawing humor from uncomfortable situations and the small frustrations and grievances of daily urban life.  (There is an ongoing gag which finds our hero thwarted again and again in his pursuit of a cup of coffee.)  It is also a sad film, though, and even brought a tear to my eye.  Without overplaying its hand in any melodramatic way, it understands indecision, melancholy, neuroses, and regret.  Its sense of dreamy gloom intermingles with and deepens the conversational and situational comedy, particularly in the third act.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7VHC21Q5HK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LO1T29E#wasThisHelpful","R2U7VHC21Q5HK2","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), Michael Keaton portrays a character who cannot help but invite autobiographical interpretation:  an actor who once headlined an ultra-popular superhero franchise, but is now regarded as past his prime and requiring career rejuvenation.  His vehicle for a second wind is the lead role in a self-adapted-and-directed Broadway staging of a Raymond Carver short story.  However, the production goes sideways—the actors feud, the budget engorges—as his own grip on sanity grows tenuous due to doubt and loathing from outside and within.  This is a big and bold art-house film by director Alejandro G. Iñárritu, trying his hand at pop-psychological comic mania after such well-received, yet divisive (and truly solemn) pictures as 21 Grams and Babel.  His latest is as flashy and ornate as its seven-word full title.Overall, I admire Birdman, but I never found it particularly moving or profound.  The triumphant level of technical wizardry on display cannot be denied, though.  It is shot and edited to create the illusion the story is unfolding in a single shot, as if the camera were darting, winding, ascending, descending, and traversing space and time with improbable grace.  It is a self-conscious feat of photographic and editorial virtuosity, and the artificial continuity enhances the hot-box claustrophobia of the behind-the-scenes environments.The story is harder to engage with, at least for this viewer.  Yes, there are definite moments of amusement and fascination as the self-absorbed movie star loses the plot while various archetypes—the agent, the neglected daughter, the showboating co-star—devour the scenery around him, but they rarely cohere into a satisfying whole beneath the ace aesthetic and the strong performances, including a vanity-free and often underwear-clad turn by a spirited Keaton, as well as such welcome peripheral players as a vainly charismatic Edward Norton and a vulnerable Emma Stone.  The film loudly, perhaps even vulgarly, motions toward age-old tensions such as the bombast of commercial cinema versus the perceived delicacy and integrity of more artistic endeavors, yet hesitates to plant its flag on either side of the ideological line.At other points, it simply pushes too far or overplays it hand.  For instance, the elegant Lindsay Duncan has the unenviable role of Tabitha, a cruel-beyond-compare newspaper critic who openly declares her plan to savage and close the central play before she even sees it on opening night.  Such a despicable and one-note character, and she seems born from an uncomfortable place of anger and suspicion within the director and his co-writers.  Consider, too, a rare-non-macho conversation shared by the plays' two female leads, played by Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts, which transforms into an inexplicable wet-dream tangent.  At first, the two candidly share their dreams of recognition and fears of failure or self-sabotage, but then, apropos of nothing, start to kiss before they are interrupted.  It is implied this is their first such amorous encounter, and their bond is never expanded upon or referenced again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ74UX3OXMZ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLG8LFY#wasThisHelpful","RJ74UX3OXMZ7K","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A man of few words and many discerning glances, Bob (Tom Hardy) tends the bar at a neighborhood pub often used by the mob to store their dirty money.  The bar is named after Cousin Marv (James Gandolfini), a hard man gone soft and exhausted who lost control of the business a decade ago.  In regard to its storyline, The Drop is set in motion by a pair of events.  One is Bob finding, nursing, and adopting an abused dog.  The other is two armed, disguised men stealing $5,000 from the bar.  The film's most potent pleasures, however, do not stem from its storyline, however involving, but rather its ace acting and the authentic, intricate tapestry of urban camaraderie and dangerous secrets.Hardy truly is a fascinating actor, capable of transitioning from sensitivity to ferocity with amazing speed and dexterity.  He expertly plays Bob as an unfolding mystery of a man.  Is he dim or simply guarded?  Is he nonviolent or rather very in control of his more intense impulses?  It is riveting to watch Hardy reveal the character bit by bit, building to a memorable third-act confrontation with a sadistic local thug (played by another capable and well-built brooder, Matthias Schoenaerts of Rust and Bone fame).  As Cousin Marv, Gandolfini shines in his final screen performance.  The scenes in which he pines for a time when other men feared and respected him are particularly poignant.  The performance plays as a more muted and wistful variation on the late actor's incendiary portrayal of a burned-out, boozy hit man in Killing Them Softly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QV959VG0WB9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UQ038#wasThisHelpful","R1QV959VG0WB9X","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Men, Women & Children, the sixth feature by writer and director Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air), does not deserve the severe critical lambasting it has received.  Set in a Texas suburb, the film depicts how various people's lives, loves, and day-to-day experiences are facilitated, shaped, or stunted by the Internet and the technology in their lives.  Or, put another way, it is an Internet-age reflection on such enduring concerns and rites as coming-of-age, infidelity, and parental responsibility.  Rosemarie DeWitt and Adam Sandler portray a bored couple both considering extramarital experimentation.  Judy Greer is a mother who tried and failed to become a star in California and now condones and encourages her teenage daughter's oversexed exhibitionism and voracious desire for fame.  Jennifer Garner co-stars as another mother, one almost driven mad by her fixation with monitoring and policing her put-upon daughter's computer and phone.  Other stories touch on pornography, high-school peer pressure manifested online, and the way people, enabled by their digital devices, can be alone together.Now and then, I admit, Reitman reaches an inch too far or lapses into modestly ponderous pretense.  For example, the slice-of-life Texas stories are blended with shots of the Voyager 1 spacecraft floating in interstellar space in a too-cute bid to contrast relatively microscopic human experiences with the ambivalent grandeur of the cosmos, and the sheer volume of tech-centric conversations and crises threatens to resemble a wag of the self-righteous finger a few times.  Yet there is so much of enormous quality here, from moments of genuine insight (and painful recognition) to a veritable catalog of strong performances, including by the very natural teenage actors.  The various poignant subplots, a few laced with relaxed humor, drew me in.  This is perhaps the highest compliment I can pay this unduly maligned picture:  it is involving and satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLKG5EJS5LBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGL7JPE#wasThisHelpful","RXLKG5EJS5LBJ","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A film honorable in intent, but uneven in execution.  One might describe it as a panoramic indictment of various forms of exploitation and prejudice along the United States-Mexico border.  Panoramic is a nice way of saying this is an overcrowded film.  It folds too many characters, incidents, and themes into its storyline and becomes unfocused; for example, the first act heavily focuses on an old-fashioned wrong-man scenario with a social-conscience twist (an innocent Mexican man is arrested for a crime committed by American teenage dimwits shooting at migrants for sport), but this angle abruptly loses momentum in the second half of the film.  It is a frustrating experience because there is quality here, including a trio of strong performances courtesy of Ed Harris, Michael Peña, and a career-best, unglamorous Eva Longoria.  Various in-the-moment depictions of the Mexican-immigrant experience, including contending with deceptive ""coyotes"" and the hardships of traveling in the desert, ring true.  Yet the film is also rife with it's-a-small-world-after-all contrivances and predictable character arcs, including a salty retired lawman learning Mexicans have feelings, too.  These overly tide screenwriting choices undermine the visual verisimilitude.  It also has a spectacularly corny ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUZQYNBM8V51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV9PF94#wasThisHelpful","RFUZQYNBM8V51","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In recent years, popular and respected French actor Daniel Auteuil (Queen Margot, Caché) has focused on adapting time-honored plays and scripts by the venerable Marcel Pagnol for the contemporary French cinema, starting with The Well-Digger's Daughter, a gem.  His latest Pagnol-derived project is Marius and its sequel, Fanny; though released as separate films, they are an entirely intertwined diptych demanding to either be viewed together or at least in close temporal proximity.  In early-20th-century Marseilles, Marius (Raphal Personnaz) is an indecisive and intense youth employed in a pub by his grumpily brusque, but also doting father, César (Auteuil).  In his own way, Marius is in love with childhood friend Fanny (Victoire Bélézy), but he also longs to see the world and for adventure on the high seas.  The couple's shared story--the betrayals, the embraces, the twists and turns of fate--unfolds over the course of the two films.  Presented by Auteuil in an old-fashioned and subdued, but entirely confident style, these are an absolute delight:  well-acted, moving, picturesque, avowedly romantic, elegantly scored by the prolific Alexandre Desplat, and quietly haunting in their conjuring of old-world provincial France and its social mores.  In the near future, Auteuil reportedly intends to round out his envisioned trilogy with a third and final chapter, César, and I very much hope he does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TLV65ZN7VXXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZ1E93K#wasThisHelpful","R2TLV65ZN7VXXP","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a captivating cinematic autobiography by French art-house director Catherine Breillat, perhaps known best for her picture Fat Girl.  In 2004, a brain hemorrhage partly paralyzed Breillat, resulting in months of hospitalization and rehabilitation.  The same fate befalls thinly fictionalized heroine Maud (Isabelle Huppert) in the first act of this film.  Later, adrift and susceptible in her diminished physical state, Maud sees a notorious, but reportedly reformed criminal (Kool Shen) on television and is intrigued by his prison-yard bluster and salt-of-the-earth charm.  She ushers him into her rarefied world and promises to cast him in a lead role in her next film.  At once disarming and intimidating, he amuses and teases her while slowly gaining her confidence, and soon she is underwriting his gaudy, lavish existence amidst shifty promises of reimbursement.  The truth becomes clear to the viewer much sooner than it does to Maud:  the relationship is poisonous and could result in her financial and personal ruin.His character, too, is a thinly fictionalized representation of real-life criminal Christopher Rocancourt, and much of this film's storyline truly transpired between he and Breillat.  Sensitive, but also unyielding, this is a riveting exorcism of personal demons via cinema.  It is not an easy viewing experience, but it proves rewarding and highly poignant.  ""It was me, and it wasn't me,"" Maud hesitantly says as she tries and fails to justify or at least provide insight into her inexplicable and self-destructive actions, and the film dives directly into the maelstrom of delusion, desire, ego, isolation, and physical pain her contradictory words indicate.  In the lead role, the legendary Huppert delivers a performance haunting in its details.  She is completely without artifice and vanity in her portrayal of the character's debilitating physical symptoms, from her ungainly, half-dead left hand, its insistence on remaining attached to her body a nuisance, to the way she pulls herself along every hallway and road, always unsteadily slow and fearing a catastrophic fall.  She also vividly renders the psychological torment endured by an artist whose cosmopolitan, fast-paced, and independent lifestyle is undermined by the day-to-day cruelties and disruptions of disability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUC888CGICF68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFZ62BY#wasThisHelpful","RUC888CGICF68","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not bad!  This retro, violent creature feature out of Austria is a blast.  It unfolds at a sparsely populated mountainside research facility.  On the eve of a visit from an important politician, the scientists find a mysterious glacier imbued with blood-red, mutation-causing microorganisms, and mayhem ensues.  With neither shame nor mercy, the film pinches from such iconic titles as Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing, but it is clearly a loving ode made by people with nerdy enthusiasm for science-fiction horror.  The goo-drenched, wildly contorted creatures, including a flying ibex, are almost entirely realized with old-school practical F/X, and the film knows how to have fun with its absurd premise without sacrificing its dignity or becoming a lampoon of itself.

"Returning to his homeland to cover the controversial presidential elections five years ago, Iranian Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari (Gael García Bernal) pointed his camera in the wrong direction, capturing images of the government responding to Green Movement protestors with undue violence.  One morning shortly thereafter, secret police came to his mother's (Shohreh Aghdashloo) home and placed him in custody, spiriting him to a solitary-confinement cell in a Tehran prison.  Over 100 torturous days later, after any number of beatings, death threats, absurd lines of questioning, and coaxed statements, he was released, his ordeal having received international media notice.In his directorial debut, iconic political satirist and Daily Show host Jon Stewart tells Bahari's story with earnest vigor and a certain degree of sentimentality.  It is almost two films in one.  For around 45 minutes, it plays as a blow-by-blow, on-the-ground depiction of the 2009 election and the fallout after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's suspicious landslide victory.  Then it transforms into a Kafkaesque nightmare of grey spaces, soul-crushing prison routines, bureaucratic torture, and out-of-left-field questions and declarations (for example, a Sopranos DVD found in Bahari's room is labeled illegal pornography).  In the second half, Stewart could honestly do more to intensify the claustrophobia and torment (mental and physical) experienced by Bahari.  He is clearly hesitant to push too far in the degradation-and-filth-and-tears direction exemplified by a hard-edged film such as Steve McQueen's Hunger, focusing instead on ways to open a very tightly focused storyline to the air, including imaginary conversations with Bahari's father and sister, both held as political prisoners themselves in the past.People have criticized the casting of a Mexican actor to play an Iranian, and they may or may not have a point, but this cannot be denied:  García Bernal is an intuitive and sharp talent, and he delivers a very fine performance here, his almost nerdy enthusiasm on the outside giving way to convincing anguish and then poignant transcendence inside the prison.  Also superb is Kim Bodnia as ""Rosewater,"" Bahari's primary (and anonymous) torturer, so named because of the overt perfume announcing his dangerous presence to blindfolded captives.  Bodnia portrays him as a volatile brute of a man with a slight tendency toward sad-eyed introspection, as if he partly understands his actions are cruel and wrong, but cannot find the courage to step outside his circumscribed existence and is therefore almost as condemned as the men he hits, questions, and dehumanizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNQMAJJI0NFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMV2TBO#wasThisHelpful","R1BNQMAJJI0NFK","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During a particularly lean period, a Delhi man (Rajesh Tailang) who earns his living repairing clothes and jewelry on the street sends his adolescent son away to a distant factory.  They need the extra income, and there is an understanding he will return by Diwali.  He does not, and so begins the parents' nightmare.  The ambivalent factory head says he ran away.  One of his friends, however, believes foul play may be involved since he left his belongings behind.  The son's vanishing shines a harsh light on certain parental inadequacies on the part of the father, previously prone to complacency and distraction.  He is not sure whether his absent child is 12 or 13.  He has no photograph of him, either.  He begins a desperate search, wheeling and dealing to earn the cash required to travel around India by bus or train while also contending with a painful truth:  he released his only son into the exploitative and volatile world of child labor, and now he may never find him.  This is a strong film by Canadian writer/director Richie Mehta: involving as a mystery, persuasive as a social document, and devastating as a family drama.  It expands and enriches as it goes, leading to one of the year's most memorable and profoundly sad conclusions.

"A troubled, but extremely rich man in his late 40s who is seldom told no.  His opulent, secluded Pennsylvania farm and the top-notch wrestling facility he has constructed there.  His self-indulgent dream of achieving personal patriotic glory by financing and training an Olympic team.  And two brothers—both Olympians—drawn into his orbit of delusion for financial gain and, for one, because his previously promising career is fading.  These ingredients ignite in Foxcatcher, a fascinating and grim true-crime drama with outsize concerns (economic inequality, mental illness, the United States of America) and the depth and grit required to sustain and explore them.This is the best film Bennett Miller has directed so far, eclipsing the very fine duo of Capote and Moneyball.  For over two hours, he fashions an unyielding atmosphere of unease.  Tools at his disposal in this regard include overcast rural vistas, photographed so as to maximize the sense of frosted isolation, and the elegant intertwining of minimalist piano music and creeping silences.  He also slowly, but confidently shades and illuminates the trio of stranger-than-fiction characters under his microscope, bringing their various bonds (brother and brother, coach and athlete, master and servant) into ever sharper focus.  His actors do not fail him.  They may not strongly resemble one another, but Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum are convincing as siblings.  They at once care for, respect, and resent the other the way family members often do; their very physical movements indicate a shared lifetime of traumas and triumphs and a resulting bond beyond words.  The former is a charming and genuine presence as a paragon of athletic and domestic stability, the latter a volatile force of nature adrift in unproductive masculine angst and therefore ripe for manipulation.And beneath the disguise of a prosthetic proboscis, comic star and former Daily Show cast member Steve Carell delivers a disturbing and revelatory dramatic performance as John du Pont, an heir to one of the United States' most storied and venerable fortunes.  It is destined to be an iconic piece of acting.  The character of John is complex and hard to describe.  He is menacing, yet also vulnerable.  He is shy and stunted, yet clearly desperate to exhibit entrepreneurial confidence and flair.  (A self-loathing master of the universe?)  He is an aficionado—an avid fan of freestyle wrestling, a published ornithologist, a stamp collector—but never masters an interest or discipline, though he pays people to pretend he has.  Such contradictions and tensions are reflected in a performance which is grotesque and, in the strangest way, touching; we are tempted to understand and sympathize with this most peculiar man as he edges closer to the point of no moral return, but he is too frightening to let in for long.  The actor and the screenplay hint at potential justifications and motives for his behavior, ranging from an overbearing matriarch (played briefly and sharply by Vanessa Redgrave) to the psychological impact of unimaginable wealth as a birthright, while also preserving a certain haunting and tantalizing air of the inexplicable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OMAT8LL6N45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2LU906#wasThisHelpful","R20OMAT8LL6N45","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This old-fashioned, straightforward British suspense film proves very satisfying.  It joins a rather proud tradition of action and/or mystery pictures set with the enclosed space of a train, ranging from The Lady Vanishes to Runaway Train.  This particular story unfolds one winter night on a late-night commuter rail from London.  Lewis (Dougray Scott), an emergency-room doctor and a widower, is traveling with his son (Joshua Kaynama).  His sleepy evening turns anxious when his stop rushes by, and the train does not stop.  He and four other travelers on the train realize a madman may be driving the speeding diesel-engine behemoth, and their journey may end in a fiery crush of steel if they cannot find a way to stop or escape from the train.It is a simple popcorn-movie scenario, but one executed well, a few minor plot holes and instances of dodgy computer-generated imagery excepted.  A quiet first act with a generous amount of character development helps a great deal.  Scott, a one-time A-list hopeful whose career never entirely ignited (scheduling conflicts forced him to vacate role of Wolverine in the first X-Men film), is an understated, but charismatic lead, and he has genuine and sexy chemistry with Kara Tointon, nicely playing a friendly female passenger with whom Lewis flirts before the night turns into a fight for survival.  Despite a presumably modest budget, the set pieces, including a perilous bid to uncouple a section of cars, are exciting and realized with visual panache.  The film is simply fun.  A crisp, playful, unpretentious ride which never overplays its hand.  I would not be surprised one bit if U.S. studios recruited promising first-time director Omid Nooshin for a larger genre film in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCUV8VWUGF89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5773HI#wasThisHelpful","R2OCUV8VWUGF89","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Writer and director Martin Provost's film of the life of trailblazing French novelist Violette Leduc (In the Prison of Her Skin, The Bastard) is elegant and epic, overflowing with fascinating period detail and poignant depictions of the volatile human condition.  It instantly earns its place among the finest literary film biographies, including The Brontë Sisters and An Angel at My Table.  As the film begins, the Second World War is raging, and Violette (Emmanuelle Devos) earns a living trading contraband.  She lives in the countryside with writer, dubious entrepreneur, and general rogue Maurice Sachs (Olivier Py).  Theirs is an uneasy truce.  She loves or at least covets him.  He is gay.  They adore, intrigue, and despise one another in almost equal measure.  He quietly slips away and out of her life one morning, but not before encouraging her to write to exorcise her personal demons, many of which stem from her distant mother and an absent father who never recognized her as his child.  As the war draws to a close, she finds herself in Paris.  In the city, her writing ushers her into a now-iconic sphere of authors, philosophers, and raconteurs.  She forges a particularly profound bond with Simone de Beauvoir (Sandrine Kiberlain).  The formidable existential feminist champions Violette's writing even as early sales prove tepid, and Violette in turn falls in love with Simone, the complications of which intensify her already-vast capacity for despair and self-doubt.This film understands how to fit a life story into the time and space provided by a feature film of a reasonable length.  It does not start at Violette's birth nor does it end with her death, and it is not afraid to embrace ellipses or let the significance of certain details or gestures slowly come into focus.  What it does perfectly is reveal the soul of its subject.  The intimacy achieved is nothing short of magical, and it is important considering Violette is a character who, from the outside, could simply register as hard, unpleasant, and prone to incomprehensible mood swings.  Her highs are as euphoric for us as they are for her, and her lows as devastating.  The film also finds visual and aural ways, including sparing, but revealing use of voice-over, to depict Violette's creativity and mental processes, both when the insights and phrases are gushing forth and when she fears she is finished as a writer.  Anyone who tries (or has tried) to express themselves with a pen or a keyboard will find the rush and the frustration highly recognizable.The two central performances are monumental.  In the paragraph above, I praised the way the film lays bare the emotional and intellectual complexity of Violette, and the committed and ferocious Emmanuelle Devos deserves a significant percentage of the credit.  She is one of contemporary French cinema's finest talents, and this may be her best performance to date, eclipsing her astonishing turn a decade ago in the masterpiece Kings & Queen.  Her inhabiting of Violette is a marvel.  Every smile, syllable, tear, and tic is distinctive and enlightening.  Superb, too, is Sandrine Kiberlain as Simone de Beauvoir.  She plays her as a figure both stern and sensitive, able to flay when pushed and gently foster when inspired.  Even when blended with confusion or fatigue, her compassion for Violette as a person (and depth of conviction regarding her authorial ability) is always crisp and vivid.  Together, Devos and Kiberlain create one of the most touching and intricate on-screen female friendships in recent memory.  Also of note in a more modest role is Olivier Gourmet.  His character is a curious and, in his own way, important footnote to 20th-century French literature:  perfume-industry magnate Jacques Guérin used his wealth to encircle himself with such chic, influential minds as De Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre and also to rescue and collect manuscripts, including many by Marcel Proust.  Gourmet's portrayal of him as a friendly, shy, and nerdy acolyte is sweetly charming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2KISKGX7O0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIA0FH8#wasThisHelpful","RQ2KISKGX7O0R","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a violent experience in North Africa, exhausted war photographer Lee (Catherine Keener) retreats to Sicily and drifts with no clear purpose.  She pops pills.  The hotel telephone rings, but she ignores it.  She then finds herself drawn toward a pregnant Tunisian teenager (Hafsia Herzi).  The girl is desperate for an abortion and an escape to France from Italy, and Lee decides to help.  Often a valuable, scene-stealing side player in films, Keener is a talent of the highest order, and it is nice to see a film constructed around her directly.  The camera is always focused on her here, and there is fascination in the way she, without vanity, inhabits this glum, fraught, and distant character.  The film, however, is a bit of an unrewarding drag.  It falls on the wrong side of the line separating tantalizing ambiguity from simple underdevelopment.  In fact, it is often coy to the point of frustration, always withholding contextual information or teasing a burgeoning theme before shying away from it in favor of another gloomy tangent.  At the end, one feels a bit sad, a bit confused, a bit bored, and unsure how to respond, though admiration for Keener's performance is easy and earned.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F38FF6K6PFTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO21UFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3F38FF6K6PFTR","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hailing from a small town in Florida, wide-eyed Army Private Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart) comes to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay eager to prove herself.  She is ushered into a grim world of strict routine.  Most of her time is devoted to moving in a small circle, pausing to glance through each cell door every few minutes to ensure the detainees—not ""prisoners,"" her superiors insist—are not harming themselves or otherwise causing trouble.  The severity and moral uncertainty begins to weigh on Amy, particularly after she befriends charismatic eight-year inmate Ali (Payman Maadi), an avid reader whose exact reason for detention and level of quote-unquote guilt is left ambiguous.  When they first meet, he begs her for the seventh and final Harry Potter novel.  The camp library only has the first six, and he is desperate to learn how the story ends.Camp X-Ray is a heavy, topical, and well-intentioned film.  It has two central concerns.  First and foremost:  the ethical opacity of a place such as Guantanamo Bay and its dehumanizing power on both the inmates and the soldier-guards.  Second:  the strife of female members of the armed forces.  The second is more powerful.  It is both involving and frightening to see Amy try to fit into the largely masculine tapestry of life at Guantanamo and how she reacts to, among other wrongs, sexual objectification and condescension.  Kristen Stewart, a much-maligned performer I have always enjoyed, delivers a strong performance.  Without overplaying any note, she conveys her character's growing spiritual turmoil.  Overtly explanatory lines such as, ""It's not as black and white as they said it was going to be"" are present, but not required because her eyes and gestures tell the story.Unfortunately, the film falters as a platonic-relationship drama and as an indictment of Guantanamo Bay, though there are a few hard-to-watch images, including a forced feeding via the nostrils.  Despite fine acting by Stewart and the magnetic Maadi, known best for playing the lead role in the Iranian hit A Separation, their characters' burgeoning bond never rings entirely true.  After the first act does so much to establish how constrictive and regulated the detention camp is, later scenes in which the duo have lengthy philosophical conversations through the night register as artificial and unconvincing.  How is this allowed?  Is no one else seeing this on a surveillance camera?  These scenes also tend to run long, extending what should be a 90- or 100-minute film to two hours, and have the claustrophobic quality of a filmed stage play.  A loquacious and heavy-handed nadir is a monologue in which Amy describes going to a zoo as a child and wondering if the animals could ever go free after so long in captivity.  Thud.  Gong.  Long sigh.  Give credit to Stewart, though.  She is splendid here and tries her hardest to sell even this low point of a scene.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZP5BX0HV9D2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLI769K#wasThisHelpful","RZP5BX0HV9D2V","A1K3SFTY71SH6Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3SFTY71SH6Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Fantastic 4.5-Stars. IMO The Best of This Great Series Thus Far!This is a fantastic addition to 'The Good, the Bad and the Texan' series and one I highly recommend. To date it is my favorite of this series. It was a bit lower in the angst department than most of the books out there these days and that was a plus for this reader.There was a beautiful growth in these characters, especially Nate and it was quite touching and heartfelt. The pacing was right on the money always moving the story forward, never dragging or stalling. The characters were well-developed and I really like the fact that there were family members from the previous books included in this story.Nate Rafferty is one of six boys who ended up at a ranch for troubled boys instead of juvie. The owner became their mentor and helped them change their lives. They are all closer than brothers and each one had a horrific childhood.In this book we have Nate Rafferty, a cowboy, rancher, and rodeo star worth millions, oh yes...and handsome as sin. He is a great guy who has been around. He met Jessica Farrell, a young, beautiful nurse two and a half years ago. They have been off and on since they met. They would go along for a few months happy as can be and as soon as Nate's feelings would deepen he would tell her they needed space and after a several months apart he would go back to her and ask her to try again. Then the same thing would happen again and again. He never asked her to come to his rodeos and had not introduced her to his family. After the last time they split she had had enough. She told him to forget her phone number and forget where she lived, that this was the final split and she would not consider seeing him again.Four and a half months later she shows up at his new ranch...pregnant with his child. He had thought of her constantly while apart as he did each time he called it off and she did the same. Jessie only came to tell Nate he was going to be a father because she thought it was the right thing to do but she has no intention of re-entering a relationship again just to have him walk out on her and the baby. She knew it would destroy her already broken heart to lose him again.Don't miss this excellent book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107QABZJYB4J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAT442Y#wasThisHelpful","R107QABZJYB4J1","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"******3.0 to 3.5 Star******Seven years ago ER doctor, Cat Hayes, suffered a devastating loss. She was engaged to be married and pregnant with their first child. Serious, life-threatening and life-altering problems were found on the ultrasounds and tests. It was horrific news and babies born with this illness usually didn't live past a couple of days. The man she loved and planned to marry didn't want anything to do with a less than perfect child. He was a pediatrician and should have been there for her. He wasn't and she ended the engagement. She gave birth prematurely but the baby didn't make it beyond a couple of days.She has grieved for the past seven years unable to move past this tragedy. She stopped living, only working, and her colorful world turned to shades of neutral. She was speaking at a medical convention in Barcelona and ran into the gorgeous and sexy, yet arrogant and somewhat mean, Dr. Dominic Edwards. They spent one amazing day and night together. There was a misunderstanding and he willingly let her believe the worst of him. She headed for the door and he angrily opened it letting her know he wanted her to leave, as well.You can imagine what transpired after she arrived home, bringing an unsuspecting souvenir with her. She was sad that she was pregnant by a dishonest man. She made the easy decision to keep this pregnancy to herself and not tell him until she knew whether the baby was afflicted, as well, and until she passed the 25th week benchmark which is when she delivered and lost her son, Thomas. She, then, tried to find him but he was now no longer at the hospital where he told her he worked. He also quite bluntly and hurtfully told her, in no uncertain terms, that he didn't stay in one place very long nor did he stay with any one woman. He made it clear he did not make love...he just wanted to do the down and dirty! All this was said after they had been together. He actually didn't care what he said or how he hurt her or anyone else. It was sad, for me, because he was unnecessarily cruel and mean.The hospital was advertising for a replacement for a doctor in the ER who was going on a six-month maternity leave. Dominic has been watching the openings close to where Cat lived because he couldn't get her out of his mind since the time they spent together. He thought if he could accept a temporary position somewhere near her maybe they could try out a relationship.This was a pretty good read and it held my attention throughout. I have to admit that Dominic was not an easy man to like. Yes, I liked him at the end but he was just not a very kind man for almost all of the book and we didn't really see him and Cat together very much, either. Not near enough for me. I like my men gorgeous, rugged and somewhat alpha but tender and caring towards the woman. This was almost completely absent till the end. He would also go 2 or 3 weeks at a time with no contact with Cat and by then she was already about 35 weeks. It just made a loud statement, in my mind, the type of man Dominic really was and I certainly found him lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T2AO34QEIV91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3MU5LI#wasThisHelpful","R3T2AO34QEIV91","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"****4.5 Star Review****Mallory Crowe does it again with book six, 'Testing the Boss' of the 'Billionaires in the City' series. This is a great read that I highly recommend. This is the second book in this series that concentrates on the Devereaux brothers. We met two of them in book four when they were trying to protect their cousin, Emma. In book seven the third brother, Rourke, will be featured as he has been estranged from his brothers for years.Arrogant, self-confident, conceited, and handsome as sin Luke Devereaux is a confirmed bachelor who prefers one night stands or short-term hook-ups. Commitment is not in his vocabulary and he is perfectly content to have beautiful, loose-moraled models on his arm and in his bed. He is working closely with the FBI, picking up where his brother left off, to bring down a financial crime organization to protect the lives of his family and others at risk.The sultry Evelyn Price, FBI lead on this investigation, rubs him the wrong way and the feeling is mutual. They can hardly tolerate being in each others company so he avoids her at all cost. Unfortunately, that does not lend to success when fighting crime. Dislike or hate is definitely not what these two are fighting. They are at war with the undeniable heat and passion they evoke in each other. Evelyn's job becomes one of protection, shadowing Luke twenty-four-seven, keeping him safe until they bring down the bad guys. When both their lives are in danger they work diligently to protect each other. Resisting their attraction becomes their greatest conflict.Wow, another great read! Please start at the beginning of this series. You will have a greater understanding of how these people connect which makes a much more interesting and easy-to-understand story.I received this as an Advanced Reader Copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OX2TC0CZYOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LQOWAM#wasThisHelpful","R19OX2TC0CZYOJ","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another great read from the 'Billionaires In The City' series by Mallory Crowe. This fifth book titled 'Touching the Boss' starts us on a journey to the tall, dark and handsome Devereaux brothers who are the cousins of Emma who starred in book four. There are three of them, all confirmed bachelors with muscles galore and a beauty most men could never achieve. We have yet to meet Rourke who is estranged from his brothers because of a falling out.Beautiful Lori Briggs is somewhat stuck. She is certain her boss, the gorgeous and alluring Michael Devereaux, is a criminal but she has very little proof, certainly not enough to go to the police. There's not enough money in her bank account that she can just up and quit because her moral compass says it's best.Michael Devereaux has a deep love and protectiveness for his family and will do whatever it takes to keep everyone safe...even risking his own life to help the FBI. Bringing down a secret fraudulent financial organization that seems to create one ponzi scheme after another is his mission. Unfortunately, there is only one person with the elite computer knowledge who can help Michael convince this organization to let him and his company invest, Lori Briggs.What is completely unexpected is the the fire that's lit in the bellies of these two as they work together to accomplish a greater good.I absolutely love this book and it is now my favorite of the series. There was just something about these two characters that appealed to me in a deep sense. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure. Even though it can be read as a stand-alone, it is advisable IMO, to start at the beginning. Each book sets up the characters for the next. Thank you Mallory for another great read. I don't want this series to end...ever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJNWU555WT7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108T2LRM#wasThisHelpful","R2XJNWU555WT7N","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"****4.5 Star Rating****In this story we have our hunky hero, rancher T. J. Malloy, his very seldom seen next door neighbor, Heather Wilson, and her two-year-old son. T.J. has been feuding with his neighbor for months because her stallion continues to escape and impregnate his mares.This books comes from a great series, 'Montana Mavericks: Rust Creek Cowboys, about six foster brothers who ended up at Last Chance Ranch instead of juvie or jail. They were mentored by the owner, Hank. and he helped these six troubled teens grow into good men. Each book tells one brother's story and they are all very good reads.Rust Creek Falls has been receiving a lot of rain and it just won't quit. The town is now flooded and it only worsens. T.J. heads for his ranch and when he is about to turn off onto his drive he notices a car further down the way and clearly sees it's in trouble. He drives down the road and when he arrives at the other vehicle he ends up rescuing his neighbor and her baby from a quickly sinking car. They are both drawn to each other but they are stubborn individuals. It is interesting watching these two grow a little closer then retreat. Advance and retreat several times. A very good story that I will re-read in a few months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4VQDUXNEBIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZCR7QC#wasThisHelpful","R3A4VQDUXNEBIH","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 'Trusting The Boss' we meet Billionaire heiress Emma Devereaux who lives in her family's Georgia mansion. She has led a safe and, if I may say, boring life. When she finds out her sister has been arrested for attempted murder she heads to New York to see what she can find out. She has no doubt of her sister's guilt but feels it is her own fault for breaking off her relationship with Joslyn. Their parents died some years ago after their vehicle had been tampered with and Joslyn was a suspect and the case never solved. She was advised to break all ties with her because she is dangerous.Her first full day in town she literally runs into former military man, Jace Lance, who is the man responsible for putting her sister behind bars. Jace is also the man who stopped Joslyn from murdering his former client. Emma asks him to help her with her investigation and he flatly refuses...until Emma's two cousins, Luke and Michael, contact him and offer him a huge payday to keep information away from Emma. Info that will undoubtedly hurt her further.This is a good read and I do recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI2ST06ZW0EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8CETHO#wasThisHelpful","R3JI2ST06ZW0EQ","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this tale we have Dr. Thomas North, a young, gorgeous surgeon who had to leave his previous position because of a scandal that was out of his control. He had been lied to and deceived. He has decided you can't be a doctor and have love and marriage so as it usually goes - he is down on love, relationships and marriage. Blah blah blah!!! Heads up...I did not particularly like either of the main characters.Annabel Cates has her masters degree in English and works at the city's library. Her spare time is filled with her golden retriever, Smiley, who is becoming certified as a therapy dog. She visits the hospital frequently and wants to begin a program there using her dog. She meets Dr. North and there is an immediate zing arcing between them. He surprises himself when he asks her to dinner. Following each date and or time spent together (which was very few) he swears to himself he won't see her again and when time passes and she doesn't hear from him like he promised she goes chasing after him. That got very old very quickly. She would use her therapy at the hospital as a reason to stop in and visit him whenever she was there but he never put forth the effort to seek her out. He had asked her out on a couple of dates but other than that she made herself available and let him know it every time she saw him. Gag!! Sorry...but she seemed very weak-willed relationship-wise. He really didn't have to put much effort into their relationship because she handled all of that and it appeared to me to be very one-sided.Towards the end, after the third break-up, it is going through his head that he made a mistake leaving her and lets you believe he has a good plan to get her back. I have no clue what that plan was because it was never mentioned again. Then....you guessed it...she runs into him again and instead of beating feet the heck away she goes right to him. It sickened me. Her mother treated her pretty crappy making sure to let her know every chance she got that marrying a surgeon would never work and they wouldn't make it. She discouraged her the whole time letting her know over and over every mistake she had made in her life and how this was one more. Then crazy Annabel would hug and kiss her after she made her feel less than an inch tall.Just not my cup of tea and I don't care for one-sided relationships.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFRRTSMM27PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00835W3V8#wasThisHelpful","R1JFRRTSMM27PC","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this series but could have done without this story. Very Frustrating!Sutter Traub is back in town. He took off five years ago for Seattle leaving behind his family and the love of his life. He had a disagreement with his family, the town and his girl involving his brother, Forrest, who was signing up for a second tour of duty. Sutter thought one tour was enough as he could see the emotional soul-deep changes that had already taken root. It was only his opinion but everyone, besides Paige-his one and only, turned against him. Without much thought he wanted out of there. His only concern had been his brother's mental and physical safety. He asked Paige to get engaged and leave with him. Paige was not in a good place to leave. Her beloved grandmother was ill and dying and she was one of her caretakers. She was also in college locally earning her teaching degree and didn't want to leave in the middle of it. He refused to try and understand and left without another word and had not been in touch for five years. I must say that these two were supposed to be madly and completely in love. Their future together had been planned and mapped out. How could she be 'his one and only' and never get in touch with her while he was gone? He only came home to assist with the flood damage and he was heading back to his new thriving business in Seattle. In my heart of hearts I have to say I question what he really felt for her. I don't think it could have been the kind of love he claimed it was. He easily moved away and had women at his constant disposal while Paige struggled to live day to day with her brokenness and crushed heart and spirit. She spent those five years grieving for him, doing whatever she could to stay busy and keep her mind off of him. You may say that she could have made a move. I understand why she did not. He left her...point bland and never checked in with her again to see if she changed her mind which she had. He had a constant flow of hot women in his bed. Does that say he loved her beyond all others?And to top it all off he placed all the blame on her, saying it was all her fault for not making an immediate decision to go with him. It made me sick to my stomach. I stayed angry and frustrated throughout this book and was relieved when I had finished. For me, this was the least favorite of this series and it still bothers me every time I think of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5NJZBEEISIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4MVIUM#wasThisHelpful","R1V5NJZBEEISIW","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The question is: Hitched for love—or business?Dr. Brooks Smith, our favorite hunky veterinarian, the most confirmed bachelor in all of Montana, is starting a practice in Rust Creek Falls. His father is also a vet and has a practice there as well. Brooks wants desperately to go into partnership with his father. His pa's health is failing and he eagerly wants to take the load off him. His father refuses with the same old ultimatum. Brooks cannot join his practice until he is married and settled and he is dead set in his ideas. So Brooks does the next best thing by starting his own practice in Rust Creek Falls hoping to get some of his father's business which will lighten the old man's load, hopefully sparing his health. What Brooks did as good his ole man only sees as betrayal.He knows he needs help setting up and running his new clinic and decides to go to the Ace in the Hole for a beer. There he runs into Jasmine ""Jazzy"" Cates and they strike up a friendly conversation and hit it off. He hires her as his new assistant as she is saving money to complete her business degree. She's a visitor from Thunder Canyon who has been volunteering for the town's restoration efforts since the flood. They develop a close friendship and when his father has a heart attack he asks Jazzy to wed him in a marriage of convenience. She accepts but the MOC is not easy as their feeling for each other only grown and strengthen. Brooks was jilted some years back and was extremely heart-broken. He refuses to get seriously involved with anyone, including his marriage of convenience bride. The road to happiness is quite a bumpy ride but enjoyable nonetheless.This is a very good read and I love the series.

"*****3.5-Stars*****We are, once again, back in Rust Creek Falls and this book is about Gage Christiansen, the beloved Sheriff, and volunteer coordinator Lissa Roarke from Manhattan.Gage Christiansen is not only the sheriff of this town but also a rancher. He has been angry and upset since the flood that came close to destroying the whole town a couple of months ago. He blames himself because he was out of town when it happened and he believes he could have saved the mayor's life if he had been there...not so but it is what he thinks.Lissa Roarke is a volunteer coordinator from Manhattan and has arrived to give the good people of Rust Creek Falls everything she's got to restore their homes, businesses and schools. She seems to rub Gage the wrong way. She talks too fast, she's too bossy, and she's just too darn irritating. He thinks she's incompetent and he treats her as such...but deep inside he is drawn to her as she is him.After the barrier around Gage's heart begins to crumble they team up in more ways than one. What they have is sweet and hot but they both know they will part when her job is done. She is honest about her feelings for him, but Gage...not so much. As the end of her stay approaches what will become of the two of them?I enjoyed this book but I do get a bit aggravated when one half of a couple refuses to give in to their feelings and pulls away for the other person's own good. That is a common theme that runs through a lot of books these days but I am growing weary of it.

Amazon has a great rental program and we rented this for one semester for $39.64. Purchasing it new costs $157.68 and used prices began at $149. We have saved a lot of money through this rental program, more than $300 for a few books we thought we would have to purchase. I highly recommend this textbook as well as the rental option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1INH1O9HSN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0073524255#wasThisHelpful","RH1INH1O9HSN8","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.0 - 4.25 StarsThis was a very good book that was sweet and comical. I will explain later in the review why I marked it down from a 5 stars. This is Book 8 in the 'Cowboy's by the Dozen' series. Each book is about one of the twelve brothers and when and how they succumb to the women who become the loves of their lives.In this story we have our hero Archer Jefferson. He doesn't do long-term relationships nor does he ever want marriage or children. The book led me to believe he was a man-whore or was having a lot of casual sex. I wish it had been more clear. I do not like man-whores and I do think he was one. It sounded like most of his brothers were as well. I also despise when the man you are with makes comments about the kind of women he likes (in bed and other areas in his life.) With that said it was enough to mark it down a whole star for me. I am worn out reading book after book that contains man-whores. It is just getting old. Had he not been a man-whore I would have rated it a 4.75 - 5.0. If I am wrong about his man-whorish ways, please, someone set me straight. I will gladly change my rating.Because he doesn't want any entanglements he has been corresponding by email with a gal from Australia, Clove Penmire, who had seen his ranch online and had a few questions to ask him. They kept up their emails for two years.Clove and her sister own a farm in Australia and it was fast going down hill. Her brother-in-law knew nothing about farming and became frustrated with he and his wife living on the farm with Clove. Threes a crowd, ya know. They were also having infertility issues. He became hard to live with having the knowledge he could not give his wife what they both wanted, a child, so things began going south.In the meantime plain jane Clove thought she would travel to America and show up in the city where Archer Jefferson lived. She had her mind set on hooking up with him and hopefully conceiving so she could give the baby to her sister and save her marriage and head home with none the wiser. She gets her wish and boy is she ever pregnant. A good while passes before she tells him who she really is and why she seduced him. He is shocked to say the least but she was now going to be the mother of their triplets.It was kind of a long road to happiness and Clove was her own worst enemy. As so many others in the books I read she was living in the past and making decisions on what had happened to her years ago instead of following her heart.There were several inconsistencies on the time line. She told him when she was three months along. Then we have a couple of two week periods that zip by. Next there is a two-month period where she had no word from him and then he receives a call that she is in labor and getting ready to deliver. There was also the time he spent in the hospital with his brother after that 2-month period had passed. In my estimation she would have been at about seven months along which isn't horrible for triplets but in the book her sister and Archer say that she is only five months along. I did the math several times and reread the passages thinking I misread. Maybe I just misunderstood.I definitely recommend this book. I am going to start on the other books in this series as this was the first one I read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGSN190UVZTBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105SY3VI#wasThisHelpful","RGSN190UVZTBQ","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not going into details as most have already been covered. I struggled to give this a two-star rating because I did not care at all for the Hero and the heroine was a weak, doormat-like woman with a woe-is-me attitude.The h said that she had been teased in high school for two years after being humiliated by the H. I believe, if she would have done her best to act confident and untroubled that never would have happened. She was her own worst enemy. I didn't care at all for the hero and the heroine was just way too weak and doormat-like for me.  Not how I like to find the H/h in books I read.She let this one incident have a huge impact on her life which showed how weak she really was. And boy was I let down and ticked off to find that in the ten years that had passed the H never thought of her. She made a huge mountain out of a tiny molehill. Was what he did nice or kind? No way but they were immature high schoolers. Get over it already! Allowing one incident to negatively affect the rest of your life is ridiculous. If she was that troubled she needed to see a good therapist or minister.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJNE3Q34VVDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CK52XB2#wasThisHelpful","R1FJNE3Q34VVDN","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally love anything to do with mail order brides or grooms but this book was disturbing on so many levels I am sorry to say I cannot make a recommendation.Our heroine, Addie McGilvray follows her best friend to Montana and becomes a mail order bride. She has hopes that her fiancee appreciates her intellect and love of reading.Our hero (and I use that description loosely,) Emmett Cartwright, and a few words to describe him: man-whore, drinker, gambler, abuser, a man who is easily tempted and has trouble avoiding it. He is hoping his new fiancee will be a Plain Jane. Perhaps if she is she will be more willing to overlook his sordid, sorry past. When Addie arrives he is shocked that the red head is lovely and much more than a bookworm. She is the most talented, intelligent woman he's ever met and wonders how she could settle for someone like him. He quickly realizes that Addie is so smart that it will be difficult to hide his past.She first gets wind of his true character when a soiled dove standing outside the saloon calls to him by name...wanting his business. He has not been philandering since two months before he began writing to Addie and he has women everywhere. He was so charming he usually did not have to resort to the saloon girls and bedded most any woman in town who was willing and that was a very large number.While in town he runs into an ex-lover who is pregnant and claims he is the father. She begins to blackmail him or else she will expose his habits and horrible past to his wife. He is scared spitless that his wife will find out so he agrees to the blackmail even though it bankrupts him and Addie.I despised this man! He treated his wife horrifically. He was mentally, verbally and emotionally abusive. He lied to her constantly and kept the pregnancy with his ex hidden. He began going into town every night after work and drank himself into a stupor even hiding alcohol in the barn.  By the time he made it home it would be very, very late and she would be asleep or at least pretending to be. He also picked his gambling habit back up to try and win enough to pay off the ex. He was simply disgusting and spent zero time at home or with his new bride. Honesty was not in his vocabulary and he was anything but an honorable man.I couldn't get through this book fast enough. Run, don walk, away from this book unless you like slimy heroes and women who take all they dish out and remain by their sides.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HT4BK6ROP9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YKQS9C#wasThisHelpful","R37HT4BK6ROP9T","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating - 3.0 - 3.5 StarsTim Duggan has been a widower for four years and is raising twin daughters alone. He has no interest in dating or relationships, thinks he'll never love again and doesn't want to. He is much too busy with his medical practice and his daughters. His plan is to put all that on hold until his girls go to college. He has a long time to wait since they are only seven years old. A friend of his has asked him to take his place at a bachelor and bachelorette auction because of a brief illness. He agrees but is a bit scared and very nervous.His friend and hairstylist, Cassidy Kaye, salon owner has promised to get the bidding started because he fears no one will bid on him. Casey goes up against another young woman who is also bidding on him and Cassidy knows this gal is not the kind of woman that would be good for Tim. Cass outbids the other woman and decides to take the stuffy but good-looking and friendly doctor out on a date he will never forget.Tim and Cass have a blast but she doesn't hear from him after their date even though she would love to see him again and get to know him better. Tim started feeling a bit too much for Cass during their wonderful day together and decided not call her because he tells himself his girls are too young and he is too busy to give a woman the proper attention and support she would need. After all, his wife complained constantly about him not having enough time for her and he won't do that to another woman.I enjoyed the story line and it is one of my favorites. I was also pleased with the growth and development of the characters, although the hero came around a little too slowly.What I did not care for:1. Slow and draggy. I have read three other books in this series and everyone moved much too slowly for my taste. It could have easily been covered in the shorter Harlequin that has approx 192 pages. Some areas seemed like wash-rinse-repeat over and over. I honestly don't plan on continuing with this series because I become too frustrated with the pacing.2. For me, the hero was a bit too week. There were many times he should have stood up to his horrid mother and told her what was what but instead he listened and even though he didn't think it would influence him, it certainly did. His mom would say horrible things about Cass and call her awful names and then he wouldn't call her for a couple of weeks. He let it affect him in a negative way. That is simple weakness to me. This kind of thing happened several times and it made him appear untenable, a mamma's boy, unmanly if you will. He should have given his mother an ultimatum and threatened to keep the children away from her if she could not behave. That is a turn off for this reader. When you consider how strong, independent and outspoken the heroine was, I feel she needed and deserved a stronger male for her counterpart and one that could bluntly tell his witch of a mother to butt the heck out of his life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JEUQ72AH7E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFS2CN2#wasThisHelpful","R8JEUQ72AH7E1","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'Bidding on Her Boss' is book two in 'The Hawke Brothers' series by Rachel Bailey and my favorite. I highly recommend all three books. I thoroughly enjoyed Faith's and Dylan's love story and how it came to be and the obstacles they had to overcome. It was somewhat unique and out of the ordinary which made its appeal that much more beguiling.Our Hero: Dylan Hawke is the youngest in the family and the CEO of Hawkes Blooms, his family's floral business. He is your typical gorgeous man who is a playboy but is trying to clean up his reputation. Soon his whole family will be in the limelight when his brother marries a princess (The Nanny Proposition) and he is doing damage control to improve his image and not cause any further embarrassment. When asked, he decides to become one of the bachelors that will be auctioned off at a fundraiser.Our Heroine: Faith Crawford is a very talented florist for Hawkes Blooms and has been wanting an audience with the CEO, Dylan Hawke. What better way to have his undivided attention than to outbid the other women and win him as her date. It takes her life savings but she manages to do just that. In the past she has submitted many floral designs to her manager to be handed over to the department that selects designs for their many stores and catalogs. She feels she and her floral designs are constantly being overlooked and she wants to get to the bottom of it. She knows she is very good because many of the customers request that only she designs their arrangements. Getting the CEO alone and giving him an up close look at her designs might make all the difference.Once Dylan sees her designs he knows there is some funny business going down at the location where she is employed. He also knows that the No Fraternization Policy for the company is placing a damper on the instant connection and attraction he feels for Faith and vice versa. The stolen kiss the night of their 'first date' is a shocker and he definitely wants a repeat performance...but the policy...Rachel Bailey wrote a great story and took us on an adventure into the world of flowers that was interesting. She brought the blooms to life and I could picture them in my mind's eye. The characters were so well developed and the story progressed at a realistic pace. Kudos for this series and especially this book which was my favorite of the three.Read this book to find out the story of Dylan and Faith. Although it is a stand alone, I would recommend reading the series in order for complete understanding of the characters from previous books in the series that are present in the following books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RX03OQWRXBJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFIH8CU#wasThisHelpful","R1RX03OQWRXBJY","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fairly good read but it moved along slowly and I thought I would never reach the end. I don't like to feel that way about a book. What I want is to feel captivated throughout, a tugging in my heart that propels me forward towards the final destination of a HEA.This is about a couple who were engaged and he was a baseball player. When an arm injury ended his career he threw everything away, including the only woman he ever loved, and decided to pout for quite a few years, wallowing in self pity and why me. He left the family ranch for the big city to work in finance but was never truly happy.When the heroine comes back home to regroup and heal from a devastating divorce they run into each other again and she is extremely wary. She is determined that she will never consider a second chance with him because his desertion just about destroyed her beyond repair. It has been eight long years apart and although she married she now realizes it was to move on and get over him...but she never did and this greatly affected her marriage.I did not care for the fact that the hero continued to make mistakes with her, hurting her and pushing her away again. That was just too much after all she had been through. He was a very bright man but not when it came to her. He really didn't make a lot of sense for someone who was so deeply in love with the heroine. The ignorance of his act was a real disappointment. If you were that in tune with someone you would have known better.Would I recommend this book? I will just say that I won't re-read it. Once was definitely enough and I don't think I will continue the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XR2FE0EV7SPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWUA6RW#wasThisHelpful","R1XR2FE0EV7SPN","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 Star ReviewThe Billionaire's Unexpected Heir was a fair read that could have been very good but....it pushed some no-no buttons for me that I have difficulty with which took it from a 4.5 to 2.5 star rating.A little over a year ago, Jack Garnier, partying playboy and man-whore extraordinaire, spent the evening and night with the beautiful Heather, the first woman who ever got to him. After their time together he has regretted not getting more than her first name, or at least what state and city she lied in, so he could keep in touch with her. She did something to him that no woman ever had. Recently he and his siblings found out they are the grandchildren of a very wealthy grandmother, their father's mother. They never knew her because their father left the family as soon has he and his twin were born and the grandmother was unaware that her philandering son had produced six offspring by four different women. It has been her mission to meet all her grandchildren and give them some of her holdings, their heritage. Jake is now the new owner of Hickory Hills Thoroughbred farm thanks to her and has traveled across the country to check out his new operation.After arriving he is anxious to check out the barns and the horses. He introduces himself to the ranch manager who refuses to speak to or look at him. When he gets a side glance he realizes it is Heather, the one he has not forgotten. He is thrilled to see her but quickly realizes she is certainly not happy to see him. In fact, she seems extremely angry towards him and he doesn't know why.The next day he follows Heather into the ranch house and notices that the housekeeper is holding a baby. The little one isn't feeling well and Heather decides to take her to the doctor for her fever and fussiness. It is then that it dawns on Jake that the child is Heather's. When Heather picks Mandy up and places the baby on her shoulder, Jake is stunned. He is looking at the same face, hair and eyes that he sees every morning in the mirror while he shaves.What I did not care for:1. Jake was one of the most arrogant, alpha males that did exactly what he wanted even when Heather pleaded for him not to. He was beyond determined and it was just too much for me. He was in no way respectful of her and her wants and needs. What was more troubling was he did things in a backhanded way. I didn't look at him as an upfront, honest man. Example: He was determined to have Heather and his daughter in the mansion with him...and Heather in his bed...instead of her living in her own home, the carriage house. To get his way after she strongly objected and refused he waited until she left to go to town and emptied everything out of her home and hired workers to remodel it so it would not be suitable to live in. Pretty underhanded and with each of the underhanded things he did I liked him less and less.2. He freely admitted, in his self talk, that he partied every night with his party animal friends and had a different woman on his arm (and his bed) every evening. I hate man-whores. Despise what they stand for and he was really into it and had been for many years. He was thirty-five years old and had been sexually active since his teens. Do the math if he had a different woman every night for many years. That is just sickening. I was hoping it was not that bad but it was and I almost began to hate him by this time. Such a womanizer and women NEVER said no to him. GAG ME!!!3. Heather was not strong enough. She wasn't a total doormat but he always got his way. ALWAYS! And it left the story feeling very unbalanced for this reader and made me feel sorry for her that she ended up with such a cad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPOFZOV3MZMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PKBL4C#wasThisHelpful","R2RPOFZOV3MZMT","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'For the Sake of Their Son' is Book 5 in The Alpha Brotherhood Series by Catherine Mann. I enjoy Ms Mann's writing but I did have a couple of issues with this book that didn't allow me to award anything better than three stars. I will explain below.Our hero and heroine in Book 5 are Elliot Starc and Lucy Ann Joyner, lifelong friends of three decades. They met in kindergarten and have best friends ever since. They both come from abusive homes, Elliot suffering mental, physical and verbal abuse while Lucy's was mental and verbal that included abandonment issues. Lucy's mother went from man to man and these men (four stepfathers) attempted sexual abuse but were not successful. Elliot and Lucy were each others safe place, playing and dreaming, escaping their abuse and abusive parents.Elliot was sent to a form of military school for wayward teens instead of prison and while there was groomed to become an agent for Interpol. He also love racing and became a world famous race car driver touring the world and also working for the Brotherhood to right wrongs. He hired Lucy to be his assistant for his racing business and she also traveled the world with him. He was your typical (as we read about way too often these days) playboy, man-whore.****SPOILER ALERT CONTAINING REASONS FOR LOWER RATING****After a big win he and Lucy celebrated and one thing led to another. He told her he was finished with his girlfriend, Gianna...except he forgot to tell Gianna and she walked in on them the next morning. She was devastated and left in tears. No, this did not sit well with Lucy. He had not officially broken it off with Gianna like he claimed and both women were heart broken. (I think in his heart and head he had ended the relationship but failed to convey that to Gianna.) Lucy is so broken that she tells him she doesn't want to see him again and resigns from his employ...out of anger, of course. Within a very short time he ran back to reunite with Gianna and was engaged to her within three months of being with Lucy. This act destroyed Lucy and Elliot had left her with a quickly growing gift. Eleven months pass and he never once contacts Lucy, his best friend. (Infuriated me!) His friends from the Brotherhood kidnap him because they found out that there is a baby boy, Eli, that Elliot knows nothing about. He is taken blindfolded and cuffed to Lucy's aunt's home where Lucy and the baby are living. This is basically where the book begins. I will add that Gianna broke off the engagement with Elliot several months before the kidnapping takes place. Yet, he never once made contact with Lucy to check on her...his supposed best friend, while most likely he was back to his man-whoring ways. This is something the author was not clear about so based on his history we are left to assume he was back to his bed-hopping ways.I will be upfront and tell you that I do not like playboys and man-whores. It seems I find them in almost every book I read and I am so past tired of them and their bed-hopping antics. I abhor cheating and although Elliot didn't technically cheat on Lucy, in my head and heart he absolutely did. He ran back to Gianna so speedily after his brief time with his best friend and that definitely demonstrated for Lucy that he cared nothing for her all along. He did, however, cheat on Gianna with Lucy and broke both their hearts. He flagrantly abandoned his best friend of thirty years by not staying in touch with her or at least checking on her to see if she was okay after their night together. She had tried to contact him about the pregnancy a few times but she always got his voicemail or either his assistant didn't know where he was...right! She gave up...I would have, as well. It makes me wonder how many other women he was intimate with after Gianna broke it off. OH YES, I might add that most of this mess ended up being Lucy's fault because he didn't know she was pregnant, having his child, and she sickeningly apologized over and over until I wanted to regurgitate. I do wish the author would have elaborated a bit more on Elliot's sexual involvement those eleven months he was away from Lucy. I could have handled it if he had not slept with Gianna or any other women but we are left to assume that he most certainly did.In a word, I was disappointed. I had just finished a book where the hero left because of a misunderstanding and was gone for year...but he managed to remain faithful. That I can handle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBR1W29EJ7BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1UY6IC#wasThisHelpful","RQBR1W29EJ7BW","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was torn between a one-star and two-star review. Only because it had a happy, positive ending did I give it two-stars.This is the first book I have read by this author, finding the story included in the 'Lucky 7 Brazen Bachelors.' I did not find the book interesting seeing as how it was one sex scene after another. I have nothing against intimate relationships in books but this was all about the sex and very little about the characters' development or their advancing relationship. The story line, if you will, was very shallow and I struggled to get past the first two chapters. Yes, I did finish it so I could give an honest review from my personal point of view.

"This is not the type of story line I enjoy at all. Early on I figured out what was going to happen...actually the blurb describing the book gave it away for me.****SPOILER and RANT****I simply have great difficulty enjoying a book when a couple meet, get to know one another and fall in love...then BAM the Hero finds out he is a father from a past lover or one-night stand. To complicate matters it is the child his young sister is trying to adopt and she has kept it a secret from him! Can a man not keep it in his pants...or use protection? Does he not have a brain cell in place when it comes to sex and pregnancy? UGH...this trope exhausts me. I have read three books with this exact scenario in the last week. I am done! If I even suspect a book has this type of story line I will not be reading it.Sorry for the rant but I was so disgusted by the other two similar books I read and this one really put me over the edge.

"I read this last evening and was not impressed. I will try not to give too much away but it is very difficult in this situation. I really didn't care for the characters. Jared and his secret just didn't do it for me. He did everything else possible but the deed and that made it lose a lot of importance...so it wasn't like saving himself for the one. The way it read, to me anyway, was that there had been plenty hands and mouths on him. It certainly detracted from what could have been sweet, innocent and very special union between the two. So it just lost me there. It also sickened me a bit how these 'other' things he did would be in public places. The whole thing was just plain weird and I had a hard time believing it. He just seemed very odd, wimpy, unsure of himself and gee whiz did the whiny man talk too much. He was supposed to be a badass Navy Seal but was a instead an insecure, whiny girl.Cassie was lacking in several areas, as well, and when they got together there was no relational development. I didn't feel the closeness. He went from one day not wanting anything other than friendship to the next day wanting to talk to her about their future. It was all convoluted and I cannot recommend this book from my perspective but maybe your should read it and develop your own opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSG07V53DJ7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPJNNIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VSG07V53DJ7J","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MacKenzie Fire: A Sequel to Shine Not Burn***4.25 - 4.5 Twinkling Stars***Boy oh boy, this was a very good read. I was greatly fond of  'Shine Not Burn'-Book one. In fact I had thought about the story several times since I originally read it in 2014. Unfortunately, for me, I couldn't remember the name of the book to save my life. Then, I was scrolling through Bookbub.com where I found an Elle Casey book and went to her author's page on Amazon. There was a book that indicated I had previously purchased...'SNB!'  Bells went off and I hurriedly grabbed my Kindle and dove in. I really liked that story. I love anything to do with Vegas weddings, cowboys and watching the experience as the couple falls deeper in love. So I felt I had hit pay dirt and enjoyed the re-read. I have to be honest and say that I was only able to give SNB 4-stars because of the whiny and indecisive heroine. She carried it on way past my comfort zone. But once I completed it the second time I thought I would really like to know what happened to Ian because we all know he was a real guy...right? (I wish.) Yes...in my head he was.I was anxious to find out who the woman would be to finally bring Ian out of his ridiculous funk and learn more about her. I was praying it was not Hannah Banana who made me throw up in my mouth repeatedly. I was pumped to begin the story. What was it going to take to bring this immature, wallowing in pity, woe is me, I hate the world and the farm - hunk of man who was acting like he was twelve - out of the depths of his self-made and self-imposed despair?So we get reacquainted with Candice, Andie's best friend from book one. She is visiting for two weeks as Andie prepares to give birth to her and Mack's first child. She is a real hoot and boy is she a straight shooter, in more ways than one and that will crack you up. She especially lays it all out for Ian and sets him straight on his pain and heartbreak...woe is poor, pathetic me, please coddle me and feel sorry for me...and for the pain and heartbreak he is, in turn, causing his family and friends. Everyone continues to walk on eggshells. Grow a pair and get a life bud! You've cried in too many beers and been in too many beds so it's time to grow up!What bothered me about this read, knocking it from a 5 to a 4.25 - 4.5 stars: I had way too much of how huge Andie was while pregnant and how fat she still was after birth. Let's not forget a belly full of stretch marks (I couldn't believe her friend brought that subject up.) I don't like to read about that because women do have some control over over that. Pregnant with a single child that ends up weighing 6-7 pounds and is eighteen inches long does not have to make a woman so huge (she was quite small to begin with) that she tries to slide in a booth and has to sit sideways. Her belly is protruding out 4 inches too far for her to sit in said booth normally. Good grief. I thought she would have twins or triplets by the way Candice carried on. I was a bit offended, especially with all the negativity added in. This woman seemed irresponsible, to me, to let herself get so she could barely walk, get in and out of vehicles and rise up out of chairs. People had to get behind her and shove up on her rear end to boost her into the truck. I felt this aspect was a little over blown and took Andie's character down a couple of notches for me. This was a woman who was in control and responsible. At least, for me, she was made to look like an ignorant, hugely pregnant country bumpkin. It was just not in Andie's character to be portrayed that way and for that I was disappointed. It would have also been nice to see her enjoying her pregnancy instead of most everything that came from her being negative. (Please know that I apologize profusely if I have offended anyone. I know there are some women who get quite large and ungainly while eating as their doctor recommended and exercising regularly. I do not mean to slight anyone in that position.) To the best of my memory, I recall several instances that spoke of how much she was eating...but I can't look it up to be sure because I borrowed and returned the book. My impression, be it right or wrong, regarding Andie's size and discomfort was because she overate. Maybe this was untrue but it is the impression I got while reading. Another clue that she had been overdoing it in the food department was how fat they said she was after giving birth. Yes, it takes a while to get back into pre-pregnancy shape (if that is possible) but that is not how I understood what was implied. I could be totally off-base and if so, I apologize.Many commented that Candice was very immature and ditsy. I completely disagree with those comments. She was a great friend and desperately desired to help Ian through his heartache and sadness so he could return to his kind, nice, loving self instead of being an awful jerk who was mad at everyone and the world they lived in. Her goal was to help him heal and move forward so he could be a better man for his family and for the woman he would eventually meet and marry. She was kind, thoughtful, loving and wanted the absolute best for the people she cared about. She knew Andie deserved to have the kind of brother-in-law he should have been for her.Ian was satisfied with nothing and he was his own worst enemy. Everyone coddled him because of his heartbreak...if you can call it that. To me, he should have been thankful the witch was out of his life. He acted so immature for a while that I didn't care for him but began to see what was underneath as the story progressed. You will see there was really no reason for him to behave the way he had for the past three years and I think it made him appear like a pretty dim bulb. He was a college graduate without a lick of common sense in the love department. He was hanging on to something that was not real to begin with.Candice was hilarious and I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face, wiping my eyes so much they became irritated. It was so funny. I really ended up loving them as a couple. I would gladly welcome a book boyfriend like Ian turned out to be once he stopped wallowing in the muck. You will find that it is Seventy some-odd % of the way into the book when they have their first sexual encounter (there were only two,) so be prepared for the wait. The book also got off to a slow start but picked up the pace half way through. I could have used more time with them truly together. It kind of went from them arguing and ragging on each other to love and jealousy. Then the book was wrapped up nicely but pretty quickly. I really was not ready for it to end but I did think it was pretty awesome and I will read it again in a few months. I found I liked this book a little better than the first..maybe half a star better.I highly recommend you read this book, but I would also suggest reading book one first as you will have more back story. Great job Elle Casey. You are a mighty wordsmith!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RNZBZ9K51DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUOH5A0#wasThisHelpful","R7RNZBZ9K51DL","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my! I have nothing nice to say and I hate that. I so wanted to love this book but it was unbelievably bad.I will preface this review by saying that I find no pleasure in leaving a negative review. In this instance I have no choice. There is not one redeemable quality in this whole book that I liked or found positive. Nothing...Nada!!Wow, what a disappointment! Were my expectations too high? I have waited for this book to arrive at our local library and now I am sorry I read it, sorry that I anxiously awaited its release. It was a waste of time and energy.The heroine was an okay character and I liked her even if she was somewhat whiny but the hero of this book was one of the worst I have read about. He treated Mari terribly because he felt unwanted by his parents since age four. His Game plan: Withhold love from everyone so when they walk out he won't be crushed! He claims he will love the baby Mari is carrying but he refuses to love Mari (telling her many times) and has no desire to be a family. He is 29 years old for heaven's sake. Is he so immature that he did not realize that every family in the world is not like his? There is simply no excuse for his behavior and withholding love from the woman who loved him. And to top that off when she went to him and told him she was pregnant he was awful, making sure she knew he didn't want this baby, a family or her and asked her if she was going to abort or give the baby up for adoption (apparently that was his preference.) Crude. He upset her so deeply she began vomiting. I don't really know any words strong enough to describe what a horrible man he was. It was beyond anything I have read.He acted like he was two years old and was ignorant of life outside his little cocoon. I really hurt for Marianna and the way he treated her. He was a selfish ass and I would not waste another minute on this book and will not read anything further in this series. That is how upset I am over this story. It was awful and there will be no recommendation from me.The way Ryan treated Marianna is what I consider emotional and mental abuse. Sickeningly so! Even though there was a HEA there was nothing that happened that could redeem him.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4YHPSAZFU46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFOVZFA#wasThisHelpful","R2W4YHPSAZFU46","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I am really torn on this book which makes it a bit difficult to rate. The last half of the book was a solid 4 stars but the first 50% was agonizingly slow and filled with not much more than gardening information. I could not give the first 50% anything higher than a 2 star rating.Our Hero, Declan Grant, is a broken, brooding man living a solitary existence since his beloved wife and premature baby girl died in childbirth two years ago. He is a gorgeous man who is only 30 years young but he made a vow, on the day he lost his family, to never let another woman into his life, to never again love or be loved...and he was leading a celibate life never leaving his home. He had a great need to punish himself by not allowing happiness to enter his life...trying his best to atone for the guilt he carried because he blamed himself for their deaths. When neighbors began complaining of the lack of upkeep in his monstrous gardens he was forced to do something about the overgrown mess.A horticulturalist, Shelley Fairhill, bravely stopped by the disheveled gardens at a mansion she passed by traveling to and from work to offer her gardening and landscaping services to the owner. The owner refused but after the neighbors filed a complaint with the city he had no choice. He contacts Shelley and she accepts the job, Shelley makes a strong impact on Declan and they are immediately attracted to one another. His walls begin to very slowly crumble bit by bit but he is still so heartbroken over the loss of his wife and baby it is next to impossible for him to move on. As time passes they are drawn closer and closer together but still he's struggling with his grief and self-induced punishment.I consider this to be a fair read. The slowness of the first half had me on the cusp of not finishing this book several times and to move on to something else. It was somewhat dark with the negative thoughts and feelings Declan had for his deceased wife, baby and excessive guilt. It became very redundant to the point of choosing to skip over them.Recommendation: Read this book and make your own decision. I, for one, would not read it again. It was too sad for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9355ZOXU0UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDZ3HIU#wasThisHelpful","R1X9355ZOXU0UR","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***4.5 Stars***This is the first book I have read by Kate Hewitt an it won't be my last. This author is an excellent wordsmith and I look forward to more books in this series.Leo Marakaios and Margo Ferras have been dating exclusively for two years only she didn't know he was not seeing other women. She assumed he was. They got together when Leo was in Paris for business and at other odd times as well. They had never shared their pasts or talked about their private lives beyond their affair although Margo knew he has been with an obscene amount of women. They actually knew very little about one another. When out of the blue Leo purposes marriage she is beyond gobsmacked and was also shocked to learn he had been faithful to her. He was very clear that he DID NOT love her but I think he did. Now that his brother had passed the running of their empire to Leo, at age 32, he thought it was time to settle down, marry and have a family. Margo never wanted to marry or have children because of something devastating that happened when she was young. She carried around so much guilt it was a wonder she could walk beneath the weight of sadness and fear.Margo had a horrific childhood and raised herself since she was seven or eight. The lesson she learned was to protect herself from loving and being loved because everyone she had loved left her.Leo grew up heartbroken and it continued into his early thirties. His father rejected him constantly favoring his older brother to dote on, love and mold into the next CEO of their family business. Leo was given a token job that was completely uninspiring and he was left so empty. Maybe that's why he had affairs with what he jokingly said was about 40% of the female population of his city. Leo learned much of the same lesson that Margo did.After turning down his proposal she knows she has to think up something to tell him so he will leave her alone. She wanted things to stay the same but now knew it wasn't possible. He makes love to her one last time and walks out without a word. But, he did leave something behind. Something she would not discover for another month. Yep...you guessed it.She decides to tell him about the pregnancy and ask him to marry her. It did not go well and he punishes her with his words and actions. He has many demands and she is so horribly ill with her pregnancy that she goes along with it. She was too sick to fight him. He would marry her but it would be a business arrangement, no emotions or feelings involved.This is a great story and I enjoyed every minute. I removed 1/2 star because these two people were adults and surely they could see that not every human being was treated as they were. It made them appear self-absorbed and a bit shallow as far as their thought process and how they were so sure it would end badly. I found that a bit immature for a 29 and 32 year old. They have friends. They witness happy marriages and relationships but they act blind to it.I highly recommend this read and hope you love it as much a I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGZDZUXBU4PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXFF99A#wasThisHelpful","RWGZDZUXBU4PL","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not real sure what to say about this book. The story line was not the typical but still I didn't care for it. The whole premise of the story is heartrendingly sad and emotional.Ali and Ronan were both workaholics and met while they were each on vacation. They clicked together like puzzle pieces and had one amazing night together. Ronan abruptly left without word because he received news that his sister and her husband were killed in an auto accident. They had been on the way to the hospital to deliver their child...who survived and was now under Ronan's guardianship.Ali was divorced from her husband. She thought they were happily married until they found out she could not conceive. Her husband began an affair with a homewrecker and divorced Ali for this woman. Ali was devastated to say the least and it did a number on her self worth as a woman.Ronan calls a baby-planning service to help him prepare to bring his newborn nephew home and is shocked when he opens the door to the business owner, Ali.  She is furious with him for leaving her without a word while they were vacationing but eventually he gets her to listen. She helps him prepare for baby Josh (why in the world would they call him Joshie throughout the book) and serves as a temporary nanny for the baby who she grows to love.When Ronan's family is gathered together, including Ali, she discovers horrifying, heartbreaking news that rocks her world. She packs and leaves Ronan's refusing to have anything to do with him and she won't tell him why.I did like Ronan's strategy and how he fought for her, what he was willing to give up to have her in his life. For me, that was about the only plus to the story. The rest was just too sad and heartbreaking.Would I recommend this book? I will just say it is not one I would reread.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1LCYU471CFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFS0AI#wasThisHelpful","RH1LCYU471CFJ","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow..this was a bit of a good story but with little depth. There was definitely a Filth Factor with gutter language and sex...making love doesn't really enter into it. It resembles a hot mess of a whirlwind of desperate need. Dropping the F-bomb 83 times was overkill although I have read a few other books that have had more. I was disgusted at the objectionable name they called her girly part no less than 22 times. What they called his package 57 times was not as insulting but over-usage...you think? When the frequency of the words become meshed in everyday language the word/words lose their effectiveness.Unfortunately, I am unable to rate this above a 2-star. If we could have had the story without some of the, what I call filth, it would have had more meaning. If they could have made love to each other and not meet in such a desperate frenzy of need...well, it would have been more realistic.***BIT OF SPOILER***The ex-fiancee was a witch and treated his new wife very poorly. When he decided to comfort said ex after something happened at work and his wife sees it...she is done with him, heartbroken, shattered!! He was too smart to do something that stupid like comfort the ex when she had verbally attacked his wife multiple times and after her betrayal to him when they were together. Just made me feel sick inside. I know how that situation would have made me feel. Even though it was because of a tragedy I lost all respect for him.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQ2CYPCIU0O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N41TVMU#wasThisHelpful","R1XQ2CYPCIU0O5","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For me this was a 2.5 to 3.0 star read.Five years ago, Janine Hart fell in love and had an intense affair with Micah whom she had met in Italy while attending cooking school. She fell so hard and deep and then her world shattered along with her heart. On the evening he took her to meet his awful parents they treated her like a criminal, like trash. Told her flat to her face that she was not good enough for their son and refused to even speak to her etc...it was really quite horrendous. After that visit Micah turned cold and pulled away from her. She knew her future with him was over because of his parents influence and the facts that he was commitment phobic, didn't want to marry or have children. What was really left for her since he was pulling away and barely looking at her through cold icy blue eyes. She packed her bags and went home to her family.Five years later he shows up at her business and tells her he wants her. Why did she leave him? What had happened etc. He would have swiftly found out if he had contacted her and she was tired of leaving message after message about the babies with him not answering a single one. She never heard back from him and was devastated.This was a pretty predictable story line with a Hero who was not at all likable...at least I didn't care for him. Micah was way beyond your alpha male who was not endearing in the least. He was horribly arrogant, a dishonorable bully, and a jerk to the inth degree. Apparently he was well adept at charming the pants off women..many, many women if my understanding is correct. Most of the book moved a bit too slowly for me and really lacked the depth I like to experience in a romance novel. Quite a bit of sex for a short book and yes it seemed it was SEX as there didn't appear to be love-making, just frantic sex.I liked the heroine except she had such a weakness for him and was not strong enough to stop his constant advances. The way he treated her made her feel as though she was being held captive, a prisoner. He would refuse to leave her home or give her space of any kind. Oh yes, and lest I not forget, he was a man-whore and had financially kept mistresses. I thought that went out ages ago. Did not add to the likability factor. Also he told her in no uncertain terms that he turned to other women...to try and get over her. Boy, nothing says love like screwing other women to get over your one true love...oops, I just threw up in my mouth over that.I hate to complain but the cover appeared to me to be of an older man. Not so great!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16S43RW1HD75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2XYN7Q#wasThisHelpful","R16S43RW1HD75","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read 'The Cowboy's Pride and Joy' last night and enjoyed it. No way I could go to sleep until I finished this read.The Hero:  Jake Hunter, all six-foot four-inches of gorgeous male with black hair, blue eyes, and a body made for a woman's consumption. After two tours of duty and a two-year disastrous marriage to a retched woman who hated his ranch, he wants nothing more than peace and quiet on his grandfather's Montana Ranch that is now his to run. Although he was born and raised in Boston, every summer he and his sister visited their grandparents for several weeks and this beautiful ranch was in Jake's blood. It was his heart and soul, his future. He wanted absolutely nothing to do with the family empire, Hunter Media, but his mother was not about to give up easily on luring her son to the family business. Jake has sworn to never open up to a woman again, no male-female relationships...ever (except random sex occasionally), never marry or have children, no sharing his life with anyone but the ranch workers. He lives as a hermit to some degree and that's the way he's determined to keep it.The Heroine:  Cassidy Moore, a beautiful, blonde curvaceous woman who is outspoken and works as his mother's assistant at Hunter Media. Her life consists of work, work and more work. She is leery of relationships because she watched her father walk out on her mother, herself and her two younger siblings. Her mother went from man to man...to man! Cassie was left to raise her brother and sister and this great job she has at Hunter Media is allowing her to put her sister through college and eventually medical school. Her personal life has been on hold since the day her father walked out on his family and her mother decided men were more important than raising her three children. Unfortunately Cassie doesn't trust any man to stick around, so certain he will leave like her father did.Sparks fly when she arrives at Jake's ranch in Montana. She has been sent there by his mother to have Jake sign the irrevocable papers giving up his chance to run Hunter Media. He does not like what being around her does to him and wants her gone posthaste. Then there's the blizzard that has them snowed in for almost a week.Flash forward fourteen-months:  Cassie has had Jake's son that he knows nothing about. She shouldn't have kept it secret but her reasons for doing so were somewhat valid. Jake had stated his case letting her know he wanted no relationship, no wife, no family or children. She deeply feared her son, Luke, would suffer heartache at his father's hand because she was sure he would reject him sooner or later since a child was not what he wanted. She also knew Jake didn't want her either. She couldn't allow Jake to reject her precious son like her father rejected his wife and children. When his mother interferes once again Cassie goes running back to Jake, the only one who can help her, with baby Luke in tow. Imagine his shock when he opens the door and there stands Cassie, the woman he has not been able to get off his mine for the past fourteen- months, with a baby on her hip that looks just like him.My thoughts: I really liked this story, thought it was good but it could have been great with a few tweaks. I was bothered by the wounds that these two grown, educated adults clung to like a life raft. Wallowing in the pain and misery of their past, terrified to love and trust, to take a risk, take a chance, move forward, realize the knowledge that not everyone in the world is out to hurt them or leave them. For me that was just a bit too unrealistic and drastic and I found it to be quite immature for these two.

"This housing is exactly what we needed and is certainly doing the job it was meant to do...or now. I recommend this item as a replacement for the original housing that surprisingly didn't last nearly as long as it should have.I cautiously rated this 4-stars until we see if it makes it a couple of seasons since we were quite disappointed with the original that came with the motor.

"I won't go into specific detail but I did not care for this book. It is difficult for me to become immersed in a book when I don't like the hero or heroine which in this case it was the hero. I thought Ronan was a royal jerk and Laura just did not deserve someone who could treat her so heartlessly, so uncaring. I truly think she could have done better but I realize she had the baby to consider.I am sorry that I cannot recommend this read. It did not leave me with the warm fuzzies. I was too disgusted with Ronan's behavior throughout most of the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLZXVSSQDLN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088NH23O#wasThisHelpful","R2VLZXVSSQDLN7","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW!!! This is the best book I have read in a long time. There was something special that drew me in and refused to allow me to put it down, even for a moment, until I completed it. I was sad when this great love story ended. I wanted it to go on endlessly. I hope Amie is considering a sequel or series about the other characters we met in this great read, especially Roxanne's brother. It would be fantastic to be updated on the lives of this super couple as well.Our Fab Heroine: We have the beautiful, brilliant mag rag writer, Roxanne Ackerman, who lives in Chicago but is on her way to cover an Elvis convention in Memphis, TN. After driving all night and using her map to soak up a spill she is totally lost and ends up in Jefferson County, Tennessee, with a broken down car and a murder charge. She can reach no one to pay her bail, the judge is out of town on a fishing trip and the jail is being fumigated. Here enters.Our Hot Lawyer: The gorgeous and ultra-ultra conservative attorney, Malcolm B. Daniels IV, has the pleasure and aggravation of being assigned to Roxanne's case and the responsibility of her custody for the weekend. They both are a bit flabbergasted when he enters her cell. They are instantly attracted to one another and you can see the sparks arcing between them when they are in the same room. Roxanne is a strong-willed, independent and a very smart woman who has never been able to please her father. He wanted a lot for her...too much...and the result caused her to make decisions based on what daddy wanted instead of what she wanted. On the other hand Malcolm has been groomed for the presidency since his birth. He has his whole boring life planned out to the smallest minute detail and even an almost-fiancee who fits the exact image of a successful politician's wife. He's had that engagement ring for six months but for some reason he just can't make it final. But what's a future president to do when Roxanne inspires him to abandoned his ultra-conservative ways when they are alone together. She brings out his wild side (he never knew he had one) and he fights it tooth and nail all the way. After all, she is not and would not be good for his image.I highly recommend this book for your reading enjoyment. You won't be sorry!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310DW6LWQAXXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIY31SM#wasThisHelpful","R310DW6LWQAXXA","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this was an easy, light, relaxing read with minimal angst. I loved this book! What a refreshing tale!The players: Sydney Stone writes a popular blog dispensing dating advice and it is revered by many. She has one published book and is invited to a National TV talk show along with her long-time boyfriend, Scott. Sydney decides to follow her own advice, break the stereotypes and propose to Scott on air. He flatly refuses telling her he he doesn't lover her and has been having an affair. She is beyond shocked and devastated not to mention humiliated beyond what words can express. Poor Syd watches as her book sales plummet and her reputation is shattered. America's love doctor goes down the tubes pretty quickly.Sydney's best friend wants to come to her aid and introduces her to Drew Young, a talented publicist. At first meeting Sydney does not care for Drew but as time goes by they spend times together and begin to fall in love, a very sweet and devoted love. Drew wants to teach Sydney how to have fun and fun they had as Drew showed her what true love was all about.Such a refreshing book.

"This is an edited review as I removed the original and am rewriting it after a second read through. This was an okay story that, in my opinion, could have been better.Jocelyn Bennings, a chestnut-haired beauty, walked out on her wedding when she found her groom-to-be in the coat closet getting down and dirty with her cousin. She had given up her apartment and quit her job to move with her soon-to-be husband once they got married. She had no commitments so she decided to go on her honeymoon alone needing to get away from the craziness.Jason ""Jace"" Traub is as gorgeous as his sexy but he doesn't believe in love or marriage. He has been a player his whole adult life and began feeling something important was missing. He also decided that he no longer wanted to be in the family oil business and his family was driving him mad, insisting that he rejoin the company. That was not at all what he wanted and he held strong. He had been absent from his family for six months following a break up with a gal he was in lust with. After she refused to marry him he just needed time to himself to figure out what he really wanted out of life. The family thought he was brokenhearted about the break-up but that was not it at all. He felt adrift, unsure of what he wanted his future to look like. He was the last single brother in his family and there wasn't a woman alive who could tempt him settle down...until he went on a week long family reunion. Yes, it was in the exact same place that Jocelyn went for her un-honeymoon. They met one evening at a bar and that was all it took. They agreed to a friends only relationship with no benefits, best friends for a week.As I said it was a fair read. I actually loved it until it arrived at 90% and then as this sweet read was reaching the pentacle everyone seemed to go haywire with antics and fighting that appeared so out of place and took much away from what was a five-star read up until that point. I had considered removing three stars for the chaotic ending that spoiled the book for me but I decided to only remove two. I have to say it was not only disappointing but also a let down for this reader. I love Ms Rimmer's writing but not so much with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY9QXJ98BKZ4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UNEUWO#wasThisHelpful","RY9QXJ98BKZ4W","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5-StarsChristine Rimmer has done it again but that is nothing new!!The Characters: Clara Bravo, a beautiful restaurant owner, needed to get away and went on a two week vacation. She met Dalton Ames, recently divorced and gorgeous, when he was vacationing at the same resort. They hit it off beautifully and he offered a no-strings-attached 2-week fling while on vacation and she took him up on his offer. They had a beautiful time together and Clara wanted to continue seeing him once they returned home. He shot the offer down because he had failed at his first marriage and he felt it was his fault. It broke Clara's heart because she was already in love with him.A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant with his child but did not tell him because of false information she received. He tried to forget her but failed and hired a PI to find her and the PI was told she was marrying her best friend, Ryan. She couldn't go through with the wedding because she didn't love him in that way but he did love her and wanted to step in to be the baby's father.So the story begins with her contacting Dalton Ames at his business and driving to Denver to meet him in a park six-weeks before her due date. He had no idea she was pregnant with HIS child because he was told the child belonged to Ryan. It was really quite a mess with misunderstandings galore on both sides.I have to say that I felt sad for Dalton being the only child of older parents who only had him to pass on the family enterprise. He was unloved and trained to step into his father's footsteps from the time he was born. There was no time me to play or have fun and no love involved in their very strict, extremely dysfunctional household. The were tyrannical in the way they raised and groomed him and it was so very heartbreaking. My heart went out to him.I was not completely sold on Clara. She just refused to give the guy a break and he did everything he could for her. I believe her fear was that he would be gone from her life soon after the birth and she was protecting her heart. In all not a bad idea since he had broken her heart at the end of the vacation and she has yet to recover. I did become a bit disenchanted with her constantly keeping him at arms length and it hurt me to see and feel his hurt. He was so alone and she had a large family and so many friends.This was a very good read and I highly recommend it. It was nice to read a book that had more than a few pages of happiness. I am tired of reading about heartbreak and betrayal only for the couple to get together in the last two or three pages. This was a refreshing book!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOT5C8NR1UFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQIZI5S#wasThisHelpful","RCOT5C8NR1UFP","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**4.5 Star Rating**I read this last evening and I loved this book. It was such a pleasant surprise to not have the big break-up at 3/4 of they way through before the HEA.Shane Colborn is the CEO of a billion dollar jet manufacturing company and he is in a downhill spiral since his ex-girlfriend writes a tell-all book that is mostly lies. It's damaging his business as well as his reputation and could bankrupt him and put 800 people out of work.Darcy Rivers owns her own website design business with her best friend. Her father passed away three-months ago and she has now recovered enough from her grief to go through his things. Her dad raised her alone after her mother walked out when she was very young and they lived a very modest/meager lifestyle. In a small box with her father's things she finds a letter that was never mailed and learned that her father had been cheated out of millions by the Senior Colborn, the father of Shane. Darcy can't let it go and knows the documents she needs to prove that fact are somewhere in the records department at Shane's business or the basement of Shane's mansion. She is determined to find out the truth. Will she get more than she bargained for?What a fun and lovely read. This is one I will reread. I highly recommend this book by Barbara Dunlop and I am on to book 2 in the Chicago Sons series. I sure hope there will be more to come. That you Ms Dunlop for a great read!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSZXO97F3YUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQK8G28#wasThisHelpful","RWSZXO97F3YUI","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***4.5 Glittering Stars***Christine Rimmer does it again. There has not been a single Christine Rimmer book that I have not liked/loved and I have read so many. I had the pleasure of reading this yesterday and thought it was a darling. I highly recommend this book and was glad to find the angst was minimal. So many books I've read lately have a great deal of angst with only a few pages of happiness at the end and, for me, they are depressing and somewhat sad. I enjoy a better balanced book and that is what I get from Christine. In this case I found 'The Maverick's Accidental Bride' uplifting and very feel good. It is formulaic but that is what we expect from this publishing company.The Players: We have beautiful, innocent Jordyn Leigh Cates who is reunited with a family friend from her childhood, the dashing Will Clifton. The are both from the same hometown but Jordyn left two years ago looking for something more. Unbeknownst to both Will and Jordyn they end up living in the same city and attend the same wedding.Something peculiar is happening to the guests and one or two fear someone spiked or drugged the punch. Take Jordyn Leigh and Will for example. They had a wonderful time together at the wedding, danced the night away and shared some scorching hot kisses. The next morning they awake to find they are in the same bed, married and have absolutely no recollection of their ceremony or the simple fact they had married. Jordyn is especially distraught because this was not in her plans and she does live by her plans.Read and see what happens when they decide it's best for them to 'play' house and stay married for a short amount to please their family and friends who are all is so excited and happy for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJ6DDWE7WLQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFS2DTA#wasThisHelpful","R3BJ6DDWE7WLQ5","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"********SPOILER ALERT******SPOILER ALERT*******  There may be more than you want to read as I rant out my frustration with this book.I actually like the premise of the story but then came more details that caused a complete about face for this reader.Barry arrived back in the US after serving as a doctor with the Peace Corp for two years and remaining celibate during that time. He is joining his cousin's pediatric medical practice and is anxious to find a wife and start a family. He has, in his mind, the perfect picture of what his wife will be like and look like and a list of all of her abilities and accomplishments.The first night home he wants to hit the clubs for some action. Who would have thought it would end up being his receptionist, whom he has never met' at the clinic where he is starting work on Monday? She saves his butt that night after someone drugged him. He never intended to spend the night with Chelsea who is his exact opposite of and totally wrong for the image of the woman he intends to find and marry....and guess what malfunctions during the course of their lovemaking?? Of course. I do believe this is now a trend. Condoms malfunction and then a pregnancy.A couple of months pass and he never checks to see if she conceived that night. Instead he is too busy dating women his family and friends have lined up for him which has kept him very busy for a few months - dating several women a week. He is determined to find the right fit for him and sweet and sexy Chelsea is not it. I was bothered by the fact that he sees her every day and after informing her of the epic failure he never asks her if she got her monthly or if she is pregnant. She has not given it much thought because she has never been regular. I thought it was somewhat callous that he did all this wife-seeking right in front of her on a daily basis. He is a doctor for crying out loud and here he is going out with so many woman while she is carrying his children. She didn't know she was pregnant at the time but could he not have waited until he knew if she was pregnant before he began his wife hunt?? That really turned me off to the story. Took it down a few notches.She dealt with it all silently but it was still troubling for me and it hurt me to think he could have cared so little. He actually appeared prejudiced to me so set on only one certain type of image even though he found he still wanted Chelsea. What kind of man is that? And through it all he is still drawn to her. No one he dated so far has lived up to the time he had spent with her but he would not allow himself to go there. Everyone around them seemed disappointed with their baby news, angry even. All of his family, his other doctor partners, and all the females who worked in the large office building were upset because they had his dates lined up months in advance and some women even came in the office and demanded Chelsea give Dr. Barry her approval/permission//blessing to date them...while she carried his children. What the heck? It disgusted me. Of course there was also the cracks made by doctor charming about how big and wide she was carrying his twins. Yes, real nice guy. It didn't seem there was much she could do to please him there for a while.The whole thing just did not set well with me and I certainly cannot recommend this book. I am sorry I read it because it made me angry to think a man could and would be that thoughtless.

"What a disappointment! I was so ready to love this book but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations.Cole was the love of Tina Sanchez life but the feelings weren't returned and he went out of his way to show her he didn't care about her until one night of passion their senior year of high school. Then the very next day she asked him to the 'girls ask guys' dance at their high school and he crudely and hatefully dismissed her, soon left town and moved on. Her heart was shattered and she was broken almost beyond repair for a good while. He returns home five years later to help his sister after her second divorce and runs into Tina again. Tina has been keeping a secret....a whopper. Cole has a four year old son by Tina and he is somewhat resistant to being a dad. In fact, he has definitely sworn off becoming involved with Tina and tells her way too many times to count that he will never marry and he will not be a good dad. Yeah...same old story: horrible childhood, crappy parents so he lets it ruin his life. Not only was he a player but he was arrogant, cocky, purposely hurtful and a real son of a jerk. He ranked right up there on my top five list of Heroes that I cannot stand.Oh my...I had so much more written but it vanished. Probably not a bad thing. I just don't know what it is about books these days that they seem so unbalanced. This book presented me with 215 pages of pain, anxiety, broken-heartedness, misery and an ignorant man who was an unfeeling, uncaring jerk of a coward. His younger sister had been through a whole lot as well but she let it shape her in a positive way. He just used it as crutch to check out of having a meaningful, responsible life. He was a rolling stone playboy and that's how he wanted it to remain. Then we were given 4 whole pages of the hero coming to his senses and deciding he loved Tina. Big Whoop! It was certainly too little to earn himself any redemption from this reader. If we suffer through 215 pages of agony and heartbreak do we not deserve more than 4 pages of happiness and love. Geesh!I'm sorry but there is no way I can recommend this book. What a downer. Not even warm and fuzzies at the end. Left me sad and angry.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4T4MSURJJ7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY9Z9AE#wasThisHelpful","RU4T4MSURJJ7Z","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had such high hopes for this book as I waited patiently for its release but I was definitely disappointed. The story moved at a snail's pace and was so very redundant.Rachel and Leo had very difficult childhoods but it took the whole book for them to finally work through their own fears. I do understand how childhood and teen issues can have a negative impact on your life....been there done that! It's all about how you choose (or not choose) to deal with it, work through the torment. Both of them lived their lives in a very detrimental way. They could only function if their world was just how they ordered it, unable to compromise on anything, come out on the other side stronger than you ever believed possible. Nope...they just wallowed in the muck making no forward progress. Rachel had to have ORDER, constant order with every minute of every day accounted for, everything scheduled to the inth degree. Leo, on the other hand, could only survive if there was no order or planning whatsoever. What an opposite end of the spectrum these two were and it got old and boring because I felt neither of them really looked inward to evaluate their emotional problems and they certainly never sought help. These two had no business bringing a child into the world with all of their emotional obstacles. They needed professional help or a good minister.It was such a let down to me and even though there was a HEA, it was just too little too late. I won't say that I do not recommend it. To each his own. But I will say that if I had known more about this book I would have never read it. I believe that books should have a balance. Happy-Sad, Good-Bad, Joy- Heartache etc. But, there simply wasn't any balance in this story.This was a very negative book in my opinion and it did not leave me with warm gooey feelings. It left me feeling disappointment, sad, angry, and scratching my head wondering how two adults could not manage some sort of compromise until the last couple of pages. There was a lot of lust on both sides but mostly not acted upon. Very unrealistic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVSWAZ9CQSE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQBXB7W#wasThisHelpful","R3DVSWAZ9CQSE6","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Stewart and Ben McFarlane were best friends and had been for most of their lives. Ben left her and their hometown to play polo throughout Europe and was gone for years. Rebecca has kept a huge secret from Ben but she did so because she loved him so much and wanted him to have his dream...even if that meant she had to give him up. Bec knew him well enough to understand that if she shared her secret he would give up his plans but would resent her in the end for stealing his lifelong dream from him, knowing he would do the honorable thing. She was a loving and selfless young woman and when Ben returns home all he can think about is her.In my opinion this book was a decent read, however, I was disappointed by the repetition of the heroine's negative thought process and the slow movement of the story.

"This is the final book in this series for me. Loved book one but not two or three.This book is about Colton and Lucy. There is simply nothing positive I can say. I disliked it greatly!! Here are just a couple of glimpses that troubled me. If you don't want anything spoiled..don't read below.1. Not until about half way in do we find out that Colton was a semi man-whore who had a string of friends with benefits to visit his mountain home when he was in need and they did not wait to be invited. At the beginning I somewhat thought he wasn't that type of man and was so pleased but I was wrong. He had a female visitor while Lucy was there who came knocking for sex and I hated it. Lucy made it sound as though Colton had an injury to his privates and she was his nurse...trying to let the other woman know he would not be available to her ever and he would be out of commission permanently. The rumor mill had gone rampant in less than a day and about a dozen baskets of food with perfume-filled love notes with lipstick kisses on them were lined up on his porch. Having that many F-buddies must have kept him quite busy and I was immediately disappointed in his character and didn't think too much of him after that. I was so disappointed because I didn't get the impression he was like that. Apparently his F-buddies wanted to come and care for his fictitious wound to his man parts. Again, Lucy was with him when he received all of the baskets lined up on his porch and she was truly, deeply bothered by that...as she should be. It really hurt her and made her distrust their relationship, which was not solid at all, for a good while.2. I find it difficult to tolerate weak women who are so unsure of themselves and Lucy was one of them. She didn't think she deserved a life of her own because she was so involved in her sister's and niece's life that she felt she had to be there for them 24/7 as well as her father. She even felt that way about her dear friend. No way could she move to be with the man she loved and leave her family and her best friend. Everyone's happiness came before her own and she was willing to live a life without love and happiness because she felt she owed it to them to constantly be there. I think her need she felt they had for her was so exaggerated. She was so positive they couldn't get along without her. YUCK! GAG!3. And last but certainly not least. This book dragged on relentlessly. I could barely make it through. It never did move at a reasonable pace but I sucked it up and kept going. Wish i would have stopped earlier.I completely understand that I am one of a handful in the minority.I cannot in good conscience recommend this book. I am finished with this series. Book one was good...books 2 and 3 IMO not so much.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLYRGHTWX93P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB5BUVM#wasThisHelpful","R2CLYRGHTWX93P","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really do not like leaving negative reviews but there was not one single thing I like about this book. There are very few books I regret reading but this is one of them.Erin has agreed to take her five-year-old son, Joey, to see his father in Australia as she has been taking him to therapy at the request of his school because he constantly makes up fantasies about the dad who deserted him. Her and her ex husband had been deeply in love and she had given up everything and moved to the outback to be with him. They lived in a deserted area where the only medical care had to be flown to you and only if they deemed the condition serious enough. Luke was so involved in building his ranch that he didn't have much time for his new wife after she moved to the Outback and she would go days and even weeks without seeing him. The stupid man thought he was toughening her up for their living conditions but he, instead, was abandoning her. Their baby son was having a health issue and cried 24/7 but there was no way to get him to medical care and the plane doctors refused to fly out to check him. Her jerk of a husband just made jokes about the boy not really being sick and that she was making something out of nothing so he ignored his son's health. She felt deeply betrayed, depressed and deserted. How could he go weeks without seeing her and his son? What was so much more important than they were? So when she was close to a break down and worried sick about her infant son she finally packed up and had a man who worked on the ranch drive her six or so hours to catch a plane back to Manhattan so her son could receive medical attention. As she pulled away from their home all her husband could do was scream and curse at her. She never went back feeling as though her husband cared nothing about her or their child. He never went after her...never once called to check on his sick baby son and this went on for five years. He just ignored it all and went on with his life. Eventually he figured out what he had done to her and their son but still continued to make no contact at all.Now let me tell you something. In my opinion there is no excuse in this world for abandoning your own child, to go five years without a word to them or even knowing if they were still amongst the living. When Erin tried to contact him or send a picture she never heard back from him...only from his attorney. He was an ass and I despised him. No reason could be good enough to exit your child's life unless you were afraid you would harm them. But exit he did while he went on with his life, became very successful and of course having involvement with other women.By the time I finished this book I was spitting mad. I lived this story except he didn't ignore his child for 5 years, it was more like 33 and counting. A man is simply not a man when he chooses to abandon his family..period! No excuses!The heroine was ok and I felt sorry for her because of the heartache she endured. She had been so broken...her heart smashed to pieces and it is only right that she was leery of Luke.I am sorry but I cannot recommend this book. I don't like reading about a parent abandoning their child and spouse. It is one thing to separate from your spouse but to also have nothing to do with your own flesh and blood is unthinkable although I know it happens.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH38I8IYIE8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSDI0L4#wasThisHelpful","R3MH38I8IYIE8U","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down until I completed it. I considered a 5-star review but I am put off with men and women pushing away the one they love because they think they know what is best for the other person without any discussion, any questions and most of the time they are wrong. Who has the right to make choices for someone else?What I loved...pretty much everything but what I mentioned above. Colt was a gorgeous cowboy who is stepping in to manage the ranch his parents have run for many years after the death of his father. He is a bit of a jerk and is quite upset when the new chef shows up.They butt heads from the get go and he has plans to rid the ranch of her and her highfaluting ways with food. There is no compromise because it is his way or else... for a while that is.Emma is tired of the noise and busyness of NYC where she is a chef, second in command. She works horribly long hours and doesn't have much time to spend with her four-year-old daughter. She has just accepted a job at the Circle P Ranch so that she can have her child with her and live in peace, quiet and harmony...until she runs into the now ranch manager, Colt. Sparks fly but they each deny it...until they can't. The daughter is precious and steels the cowboy's heart right along with her mother.This is a great read and was well-written. I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCXY3VDK9UZ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPDUW0Y#wasThisHelpful","RCXY3VDK9UZ1G","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It appears I am a minority reviewer. I really didn't care for this book and my reaction to it was left me with sadness, anger and disbelief. I had a real problem with the hero, Hank. He seems like an alright kind of guy...maybe, but he has been a man that has shirked his responsibilities and abandoned his child/children. I am sorry to say that in my view he was not an honorable man. When Hank was a teen he let his pregnant girlfriend think he had abandoned her and the child...the child he did not want. He now has a daughter he has seen a handful of times and the only responsibility he has taken is sending financial support to the ex. He probably would have continued to avoid his child if his ex-wife had not planned a three month vacation and sent her to him at the ranch. The man had a ten year old daughter he had seen a handful of times in the past nine or ten years. His so-called excuses were worse than lame, they bordered on ridiculous. He was and is one who gives up much too quickly, lacking in strength of character. He did not fight for what he wanted years ago.When he was a teen he and the love of his life, Kelly, got pregnant and he reacted horribly. He left her in a very bad situation and she lost the child. He now tells her he was trying to earn money and he was going to marry her and they would raise the child. That is true, however, It's a shame he forgot to fill her in on the plan. She lived next door, it wasn't like he didn't know how to find her. She lost the babe and left, unable to live next door to the man she so desperately loved. He deserted her and had not gotten in touch with or tried to find her after she was kicked out of her home. She was shattered and destroyed beyond belief because young or not he was her world and she deeply loved him. He said she was his world, as well, but said horrible, almost unforgivable, things to her yelling accusations and leaving her to believe he had abandoned her. After she left he did not try and find her but instead left for the rodeo and jumped right into another woman's arms, married her and to top it off had a child with her when he didn't want a child with Kelly. If that is what love is I want no part of it.  He completely shattered the only woman he says he has ever loved. As the book said Hank moved from stunned disbelief to anger (about her pregnancy.) The book also says, The long line of mistakes he'd made with Kelly stretched clear back to the day she'd given him the wonderful, awful news she was pregnant.It was not like our hero learned much from his mistakes as he kept making them in the present like not listening to Kelly and getting them caught out in a bad storm, being ok with just letting her walk away again and not going after her, yelling at her and once again saying heartbreaking things. He was also keeping secrets from her, pretending to be a big hot shot realtor when, in fact, he actually lost his business due to the economy (or poor management which the book does not say. With all of his other lousy decisions and lame excuses it makes me wonder if it was really the economy.) That caused her to feel used because she had hired him to sell her grandfather's ranch and he certainly needed the money. All he owned fit in his truck. and when she told him how she felt (being used for the money) he turns it around and claims she used him. He let her down many years ago and he continued to let her down. He let his daughter down, as well. What is it with some men who have children and rarely see them, completely absent from their lives and he knew it was not a life he wanted his daughter to live but did nothing. There is no excuse that would ever be good enough to warrant what he did to Kelly and to his daughter he had with the ex-wife that he never loved. At one point the ex had so many flings he didn't know if the child was his. The list of errors and mistakes just continued to grow throughout the book and for this reader those outshone the relationships and the HEA. Kelly really deserved better than Hank and after all the mistakes he continued to make I would think she would be leery of trusting him. I sure would be. His history of abandonment should have scared her to death. How did she know he wouldn't do it again, especially towards the end when he stopped fighting for her.I know you all will rant and rave about my review and I am truly sorry that I did not like the book. For me, it was a stretch to give this book two-stars but maybe this will help you understand why I feel this way. This is only my opinion because, unfortunately, I have lived most of this story. My now ex-husband has refused to meet his son since he left when I was pregnant and had another child with someone else shortly after our child was born. Thirty-three years later and he continues to be absent while having other kids by various women. My feelings are not sour grapes but they are from someone who has felt and lived the pain, known the devastating heartache first hand. I knew exactly how broken and destroyed Kelly felt. I could feel in my gut the things she felt when she felt abandoned by the one person she loved most and the agonizing pain she felt when he moved on so quickly, married and had another child when he really didn't want the one she was pregnant with....not at first anyway. It is a soul-shattering brokenness that no one should ever have to feel and live with and I identified with her greatly. If you have not lived it then you have no idea how horrific it feels, like you are going to die from the brokenness and immense pain. I have felt what she felt. That is why I feel as strongly as I do on this subject matter and I understand that everyone thinks Hank is great...but I don't. I just didn't think much of the guy for all his mistakes and choices. He was weak in my opinion, at least that is how I saw him. I was so bothered by this book that I was up almost all night feeling frustrated...even angry for his behavior. It has certainly not caused other people to feel this way but if you have lived this pain and abandonment and been so broken you didn't know if you would survive it maybe you will understand why this book affected me so strongly in a negative way. It is one thing to read this book and enjoy it if you haven't lived the devastation, but totally another if you have and all the old wounds crack open a little bit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8A9MCDJBILAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFL0VE#wasThisHelpful","R8A9MCDJBILAV","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful pediatric surgeon Naomi Horton has a strong desire to have a baby of her own but her marriage failed and she has not had much success with the dating scene. She is strongly considering having a child on her own by artificial insemination but she just might have second thoughts when she meets the new Chief of Pediatric Trauma Surgery.Gorgeous Rick Weber (makes me think of the good old days on General Hospital) and Naomi Horton have an undeniable connection from the second they lay eyes on one another and the air sizzles between them. A wife and family are nowhere on Dr. Rick's wish list. He doesn't feel or do emotions, period! His emotional walls were erected years ago and he is not about to let them tumble down.When they travel together for a medical conference in Chicago the sizzles burst into flames and they have a wonderful, sweet, sensual love affair but before they can return home he tells her he doesn't want her. He viewed it as a no-strings-attached weekend. Too bad he didn't fill Naomi in on that bit of info. She had already told him she would not have a fling so when he continued to pursue her she thought he wanted more.Several weeks after the convention Naomi discovers she's pregnant and she is doing her best to ignore the good doctor. Her heart is broken because she loves him like crazy and he has made no effort to contact her. She's already lost one pregnancy and decides to wait until she has passed the three-month mark before she tells him. That admission doesn't go too well.A great book. I loved it. There is not a lot of angst, not the kind that has everyone all tore up for long periods of time. It is sweet and lovely and it will definitely go on my re-read list. The writing and medical understanding was very good.

"**4.5 Stars**I truly enjoyed this book and what a great surprise that the Hero was NOT a man-whore. You don't find that very often anymore. I'm fed up with reading about men and their bedroom-hopping antics.Nate Longmire is a very good looking, somewhat awkward, totally brilliant, and a tad nerdy billionaire in the app industry. He is a sweetheart of a guy who is suffering the loss of his brother and sister-in-law due to a horrific vehicle accident that claimed their lives. He was awarded guardianship of their six-month-old daughter and he is totally perplexed, knowing absolutely nothing about babies and children.Trisha shows up at his home, sent there accidentally by his assistant who thought she was applying for the nanny job. She was actually supposed to meet Nate at his office to discuss his possible donation for her charity.Trish is completing her masters and began a charitable organization for the Lakota American Indian kids to help with school supplies, lunches, a healthy afternoon snack program, and eventually computers. She works alone and almost lives in abject poverty herself as she tries to find aid for the Lakota children. She was one of those children years ago and is desperate to make their lives a little better. She has a plan and it includes one gorgeous billionaire who she believes may be willing to help her organization.I totally loved this book from the very beginning. It did not take any time at all to get into the story, it moved at a pleasant pace and did not drag.I deducted half a star because of the redundancy of Trish's thoughts and explanations about being so determined to be unlike her mother. I do find it a bit odd that she seemed to be clueless about the depth of her and Nate's relationship and that it didn't resemble her mothers dependency on men in any way. I also understand she was 25 and had absolutely no experience with men or dating but she was a little out there in this area and we heard it many times. Other than that it was a great read! I highly recommend it. It's low on angst, no violence, some hot sexcapades and a man and woman who made each other a better version of themselves just by being together. They fit like puzzle pieces and their love story is quite lovely. I read where another reviewer thought it was too insta-love but I did not feel that way in the least. People can and do fall in love in a month's time. Sometimes you just meet someone and you know...you just know...like it grabs you and nothing you can do can pull you away from that force. You also have to realize that she was a live-in nanny and he worked from home so if you consider all the hours they spent together every day...and night, It would be equivalent to going on a 4-hour date approx. 90 times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4MDZE4PI2MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFFFD2A#wasThisHelpful","R2T4MDZE4PI2MU","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly enjoyed this book. It was a light, fun read with little angst. In today's books that is a pretty big deal as the story lines usually seem to be mired in angst and 'happy' comes along in the last two pages. 'Disorderly Lady' was a pleasant surprise. A huge plus for me was a totally hot and faithful man from the moment he met 'the one.' I was a bit worried because of his reputation that he may have dalliances but he did not. He was faithful to his heart even when he assumed she was not. Bless you for that Ms Conn.I won't go into the details of the story as many others have already done so.

"I am so sorry to say that I did not like this book any whatsoever. The story line was okay and it had the potential to be a very good story, but it sorely missed the mark.Darcy Penn is a very sensible waitress in Vegas and this is her final night at her job. Jeff Norton is at one of her tables and it seems she gets to him and he doesn't want the night to end. Unfortunately it does...with Darcy in his bed. When he excuses himself to go to the restroom to dispose of the latex he discovers a very serious malfunction. Before he can get back to Darcy, who is supposed to be waiting in bed, she quickly and quietly escapes before he can break (pardon the pun) the bad news. She is regretting what she has done because sensible Darcy does not do one night stands. She wants it to be more.Jeff heads home the next day not wanting to end his brief relationship with Darcy but instead within a few weeks he gets involved with another woman, the perfect love interest for him, one, he feels, is a super great fit for him and his life. He has already planned to propose to her in approx 6-months...but they have only been together 5-weeks. That does it for me right there. Why in the world didn't he try and find or contact Darcy if he wanted more from their relationship. He was a very wealthy man and he could have had her found if he really wanted her. Instead, typical man, he thinks he has found his perfect match in just a very short time.I simply despise this type of situations with the other woman, all the misunderstandings, and the stupid game of trying to guess how the other one feels. Ugh! I looked so forward to this book and I am so disappointed.I am sorry that I cannot recommend this book, but you may want to try it for yourself. The situation in this book is one that is hard for me to tolerate. Maybe it isn't the same for you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IKELEF4ZHIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBZL8HS#wasThisHelpful","R27IKELEF4ZHIM","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this story interesting at first and was enjoying the read but after getting into it a little ways it quickly became very redundant. The same feelings and emotions over and over again: wash, rinse, repeat. She wants him...won't let herself have him and we hear/read this continually throughout the book. The only reason for giving this two stars instead of one is because of the HEA...finally.Alex Ryan lost his wife, the love of his life, to cancer four years ago. He has been merely existing, certainly not living. His in-laws, especially the mother-in-law, makes sure to keep him living in the past, scared to death that he may move on. She is one wacky woman, mentally unstable, and the bane to his existence in my  opinion...not his. It was quite sick and sad that she wanted Alex to remain living in the past spending all his time keeping his dead wife's memory alive 24/7. The really aggravating point here is that Alex allowed this. He went to spend the day once a week with the in-laws still, just as he and his wife had throughout their marriage. Instead of speaking his mind and beginning a new life, he did whatever she suggested, giving into her every whim, and he was constantly concerned about her and that fed into her instability. I was so disappointed in him for going along with this craziness until close to the end. They loved him, no doubt, but she was determined to keep her daughter alive in her life as well as Alex's so he would refuse to move on. She thought of him as a son since his parents were dead and was scared out of her wits that she would lose him.Paige Kenner is a single woman who decides to have a child on her own, no help from a man thank you very much. Using a local sperm bank she had a lovely daughter. She had made quite a few bad choices in earlier years, mostly due to her horrific parents. They are the absolute worst book parents I have ever read about. Disgustingly cruel. She can do no right. For me it was over the top for her parents to be so awful and for Alex's in-laws (who he looked to as parents) to be so controlling of him and his life. Just too much for one book. It discolored this story and just made it unbelievable.Alex and his wife had used IVF to get pregnant but it never happened and then she was diagnosed with cancer and died, Alex having the eggs and sperm destroyed. One day he gets a call from the sperm bank informing him that his specimen had been mistakenly used and as a result he was the biological father of a daughter. He goes to meet his daughter's mother and begins to visit regularly to get to know them. They fall in love and life is finally, after much angst and struggle, very good and love abounds. Then...another heartbreaking tragedy around 80%. A cruel twist of fate that nearly destroys Alex and their relationship. That is when my opinion changed dramatically from a pretty fair book to one I was sorry I read. It ruined the story for me and it failed to redeem itself in my eyes. I am a firm believer that there needs to be a balance in books. It is disturbing when most of the book is angst filled, sad and heartbreaking. How much did this author want Alex to suffer through? Wasn't losing his wife enough? Was it really necessary to have this major twist happen to this family unit that was just beginning? No...for me it was not necessary to add any more heartache. It tipped the book over the edge. The story was much too long and drawn out, frustratingly so.This is my honest opinion and I am still upset a day after completing the book. It actually left me feeling sick to my stomach and just writing this review is causing more upset. I am sorry to say that I, personally, cannot recommend this book. I see by the few reviews that I am definitely in the minority but this is simply how the book made me feel. I don't like to feel sad, heartbroken and frustrated after completing a book...even taken into consideration that the ending was okay. The last 20% was the ruination of 'The Daughter He Wants.'","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJ1SIM7TTIP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6G8MCE#wasThisHelpful","R3KJ1SIM7TTIP2","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Star ReviewJuly 16, 2015--Update RereadI love this book and thought it was just as great the second time through...maybe even better. A book I highly recommend!!!Daisy Huntingdon-Cross is a photographer and she loves to shoot weddings among other things. On Valentines day she had finished up shooting a wedding that had been held at a castle. It began to snow and her car was stuck in the car park. Seb, an employee of the castle-she thinks, saves her that night and she ends up spending it in his arms. They were both very taken with each other but she never heard from him so she didn't try to reach him either...until six weeks later when her pregnancy test gave up with a positive result.She knows the right thing to do is tell Seb he is going to be a father so she heads to the castle and manages to see and talk to him. He offers her marriage but with certain limitations she needed to understand and abide by like...there could be no love or emotion between them but they could bestow it on the baby, just not each other. Seb had horrible parents and he wanted to avoid the turmoil his parents were in his whole life. But can a wedding photog who has planned her very own wedding since she was a young girl give up on her own longings and ideas of love, raw emotion, romance, and a marriage as beautiful as her parents have? Will living together in a monogamous marriage without love and emotional involvement between spouses be enough?This was a great read and I could not put it down until I was finished with it. I highly recommend this read. I really like both main characters and it was sweet to watch the ups and downs of their relationship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LLGLRS4SQSCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY9ZAQM#wasThisHelpful","R1LLGLRS4SQSCP","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to be honest and say that I was not fond of this book at all and it left me feeling frustrated and wanting desperately to strangle the goody-two- shoes heroine.Shanal is set to marry Burton but she doesn't love him. It is a financial arrangement and she decided during the ceremony that she objects to living a life in a loveless marriage. She turns and escapes.Burton has wanted Shanal for a good while and took every advantage possible to bully her into marrying him. But there is no love at all, he just wants ownership, possession.Raif has been enthralled with Shanal since they were teens but she never had anything to do with him. As she rushes away from the church, he leaves the church to follow and help her. After a passionate few days together things begin to implode as Burton hunts for her, determined to make her marry him.Let me tell you something that was horribly irritating to me. This girl's family let her agree to tie herself to this awful man just for financial reasons. Her father was a surgeon and he knowingly kept his disease a secret from the hospital where he performed surgery and was the cause of a patient's death. Now her father is terminally ill but would rather risk his daughter's future because he is too prideful to take responsibility for his actions. He is basically broke because of paying off the grieving family. What parent in their right mind would let their beloved daughter marry a mean, emotional and mentally abusive worm of a man just so the ill father can save face and not admit his illness and the wrongful death? Just blew me away and not in a good way. Could a parent actually expect this of their child, their daughter, to live a miserable existence all for the purpose of hiding her father's shame? Good grief.To make matters even worse she is pregnant with Raif's baby, this is a good thing, but the ex fiance is once again forcing her to marry him and she is ignorant enough to go along with him even though she is in love with Raif. And let's not forget that Burton demands she abort Raif's baby. He drives her himself to a private clinic and....wow what a cowardly woman. Over and over and over again she refused to tell Raif why she had to marry this creep. Now, Raif was a billionaire, yes, you read it right. Not millionaire but Billionaire and heaven knows he could have fixed most anything. He wanted both her and the baby desperately and she treated him horribly to keep him away from her because Burton had warned her away from Raif. She is one of those heroines that is simply to stupid to be allowed a place in any book. No self respecting woman would do what she did. I despised her and the way her character was written. If she explained in her thoughts or out loud once, she repetitiously said it a hundred times why she had to marry this man. I was ready to chuck my Kindle through the family room window...it was for her father blah! blah! blah!...gag gag gag!!!  Now this father and mother lived in a very expensive mansion that could have been sold and they could have downsized. But no, daughter promised he would never have to sell his family home because they had already started making it wheel chair accessible, yet, he had no income. She was trying to support the family. Can we say doormat to the inth degree.As opposed to the other reviewers I thought this was a very poor ending to this series and I, in good conscious, cannot recommend this book. I wish I had not read it. The only saving grace was Raif.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC9L0PQ4IJCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYD62QU#wasThisHelpful","R1RC9L0PQ4IJCV","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When she was a young teen she was sent to a boarding school while her three other siblings remained at home in their tight-knit little family unit as they continued to be very close and Grace felt horribly left out and unwanted. She was extremely gifted so her parents decided that for her to be challenged they would need to send her away to school. It came very close to destroying her life. She had skipped a grade and was bullied because she was young and naive. Her parents didn't hold back on what they expected of her and there was no question she was absolutely expected her to follow the path they had set out for her, including what kind of career she would have and where she would live. She had her own dreams but didn't dare follow them and did exactly what her parents wanted. She was too frightened not to. What parent in their right mind would send a young teen away to boarding school while they kept their three other children at home? They reside in Australia so what were they thinking went they sent their eighteen-year-old to New York City alone to live and take more schooling then begin her career in the field they had chosen for her. Excuse me, but what the heck?? Are they nuts? Talk about isolation.Of course Grace was laden with major emotional problems that kept her from really living life. She merely worked constantly and existed. So very sad. This is the second book I've read in the Preston Family from Crystal Point Series. The First one was 'The CEO's Baby Surprise.' There were  lots of similarities in these two books. Both Grace and MJ were messed up emotionally. They had the same kind of negative thought patterns and they hardly ever thought before they spoke, not caring how rude and nasty they sounded. It also didn't seem to bother them that their words hurt people they loved. They were, simply put, shallow, self-serving, and selfish beyond what is believable and realistic. If these two sisters behavior is so much alike in a blatantly negative way then we can assume that there is only one place to look...the parents. It is obvious they were both affected by their upbringing since their insecurities and poor emotional health were in the pits it is only logical that our fingers would point to the parents. Or possibly the author followed the same formula for the sisters which made them appear to be so alike. Not sure.Again, like in 'The CEO's Baby Surprise' the repetitiveness of thoughts, words, phrases and complete conversations was beyond all reason and annoyingly did not encourage me to move forward but I did finish the book. The ending was sweet but the book became tiresome.Now I must mention Cameron (not my son Cameron but the book hottie Cameron--good name BTW.)  I believe he was a good guy and did many things to help others and the community. I also believe he truly loved Grace. He teased her unmercifully, ruthlessly with snide comments, addressing her with condescending names and said purposely hurtful things even when he realized she was hurting and something was wrong with her. I did not appreciate that part of his character and even with the HEA it still bothered me at the end of the book.So, I think I'm done with this series. The two books I have read are just barely okay, in my opinion. But you should certainly try them for yourself. Obviously my opinion is quite different from the majority.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5VJMLZF6TYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNRHLBA#wasThisHelpful","R2K5VJMLZF6TYY","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Dennison was on a mission to save the life of his beloved daughter (who deserved a good bit of discipline if you ask me.) If she didn't receive a transplant she was not going to make it. Mark knew just who he needed to go to for help. Catherine, the twin sister of his dead wife, whom he blamed for his wife's death and banished from his and his niece's lives, not allowing her to see her own niece in ten years. She was his best chance at restoring his daughter's health.Mark had secretly had strong feeling for Catherine since the day he met her when he went to pick up her sister for their fourth date. He broke it off with the sister because of his strong feelings for Catherine but the ex-girlfriend/sister conveniently comes up pregnant and he did what he thought was the right thing...by marrying her although there was no love involved. Big mistake! Ruined Lives! I had to wonder if the child was even his. Had she gone behind his back to get pregnant so she could trap him? I guess that was not the case but I was still left with that thought strongly in my mind.This is a story that clearly shows things are not always as they seem and Mark Dennison made a terrible mistake by denying his daughter the honor of having an aunt for the ten years his wife has been dead. The things he said to Catherine were shameful and nearly destroyed her. I really disliked him for a while because of this but he redeemed himself somewhat later on.My rating: As I was reading through this book there was a lot of one step forward, two steps back...that kind of thing with a bratty sick little girl who was given too much power and say so for a child. It actually caused me to dislike the child somewhat though I know it was not her fault. That blame lies directly on her father's shoulders. So up until the last two chapters my rating was going to be 3-stars but the story had such a beautiful conclusion that I raised that rating to 4-stars.I recommend this book and did enjoy most of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2ZGFNJY575Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEXBHVQ#wasThisHelpful","RO2ZGFNJY575Y","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book we meet Mary-Jane who is subbing for her good friend who owns and operates a boutique in an upscale resort while the friend heads home to care for her sick mother. It is supposed to be a three-week gig that morphed into six months. While running the store she runs into Daniel, a beautiful, cocky, arrogant, full-of-himself, CEO of the resort and they have this undeniable monstrous sexual pull. Daniel travels between all of his family-owned resorts keeping tabs on everything and everyone so he is not around much at all but he does come to town to celebrate his grandmother's birthday. MJ, as she is called by friends, has also become close friends with his grandmother and attends her birthday gala.Now a little about the swoon-worthy Daniel. Other than the descriptions listed above he is also a sad, lonely, grief-filled man who lost his pregnant wife to an auto accident four years earlier and has sworn that he will never love again. Losing is too painful and he associates love with loss and brokenness. He is also thrilled to see Mary-Jane at his grandmother's birthday party and before long they are back in his bedroom and a month or so later she realizes she is pregnant with his child.MJ is an honest woman and knows she must tell him he is soon to be a father. He has been calling her since their night together and he feels so drawn to her that he wants to continue seeing her until he gets her out of his system. She is indignant and tells him to go to hell. Wow!Unfortunately this book is mostly about their battles, their stubbornness and Mary-Jane's continual whining. In her warped mind Daniel can do nothing right and she is determined to keep him out of her life and is not to keen on letting him be a father as well although she says she is. Her actions speak louder than words and her dialog is so repetitive that I was ready to lay the book to rest numerous times but I trudged on for Daniel's sake. I was curious to see if she would ever treat him as a human being. She was terribly bitchy and I longed to reach through my Kindle and strangle her. We hear the same thing from her throughout the whole book, minus the last few pages and I had every whiny, stupid line memorized and somewhat lost interest. It was a shame since the storyline was a very good one. I just didn't care for Mary-Jane and she was her own worst enemy. She was not likeable in the least and if the protagonists are not likeable then it is difficult for me to like and enjoy a book. Her words hurt Daniel at every turn and hadn't he already been through enough?I like my books more balanced. We all are aware there will be angst  and heartache but also love and devotion as well as a HEA (well, most of the time) but it is my opinion that there needs to be some happiness as well and there just wasn't much of it to speak of until the last few pages. That is just not enough for meMy favorite part of this book: Once Daniel has been intimate with Mary-Jane no other woman is enough and he remains celibate during their time apart. He had one date and was so miserable that he had her home by 9pm and only kissed her hand goodnight! That is a good thing for this reader who detests man-whores. The sleeping around stuff just doesn't get it for this gal. Daniel had class.My least favorite: MJ's repetitiveness and unwillingness to look beyond her own self and insecurities to see the man that Daniel was and understand the horribleness that he lived through losing his wife and unborn child.Would I recommend this book? Probably yes, but I will say that it is not a re-read for me. I am interested in the connecting stories from the other characters in this book and will give them a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKLWNIRSK06A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFE7UUO#wasThisHelpful","RXKLWNIRSK06A","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a good book and one of the better ones in the 'One Night Series.' I highly recommend this read!In this story you will meet 25-year-old, Claire, who is painfully shy and overwhelmed by chatter and people. She prefers to remain quiet and in her own company. Claire's father received a threat against her and she now has her own personal bodyguard, Michael, who is a dark-haired Adonis. He is also a quiet guy who has secretly been in love with Claire for years. You will definitely want to read this to find out more about their relationship and how they both try to work through their issues and which one of them runs away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9MD9EWADOXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVKKUKE#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9MD9EWADOXZ","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really liked the Uni-Ball Pens since they were first introduced and they are all I use when I need a pen. These are very classy looking with a subtle design on each pen, however, the writing is not as good as other Uni-Balls I have purchased. The smoothness is missing and when writing a word there are little blank spaces where the ink skips. Personally, I don't like going back over what I have written to correct the missing ink because I usually make a mess of it. I also had the pleasure of filling out some very important forms that were front and back. The ink bled through so badly that you could hardly read what I wrote. Unfortunately, there was not an option to get another blank copy to redo the forms with a non-bleeding pen so I had to send them in as they were and they were difficult to read.My 2-star rating is a reflection of the pen's ability to get the job done. If I have to go back over every word I write to fill in skipping ink, it is simply not worth it and I would not re-purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNGS74O45BKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPDNTQS#wasThisHelpful","RPNGS74O45BKE","A3CAIZ5D023DAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CAIZ5D023DAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice exercise pack.. There are others that are less expensive ( at the time of this review ranging at $49.99 ) but don't have all the bells and whistles this does. . Its comfortable and holds a ok amount of water, would be beneficial to add another bottle of water but that would probably make it too bulk...  It holds my iPhone 6 plus in the accessory pouch which is totally nice and my keys and cards in the ""smartphone pouch"" so for people with a bigger phone it will fit in one of them!For the price you are paying for a well made popular running belt with a nice streamlined look.  I also like the gel container in which I put lotion which works great.. In the summer I will replace with sunblock.

"This is a nice basic MP3 Player but confusing to use at first! I am unsure though why its labeled as a MP4 player but I might be doing something wrong when transferring.. So when I first got this MP3 player I was a little put off by the controls but that is because I was trying to use it as a iPod.. Total learning curve and I wanted to throw it away.. But after learning the controls and after using now for a month I am totally in love with this little player. When you unpackage it don't even try to work the controls after charging- Just plug into our computer and transfer music onto it. I have a Mac and it was a flawless transfer process after I learned how to convert to MP3. Just drag and drop my songs from ITunes ( that I purchased and own ) on to this drive in which your computer will recognize.. ( also if you contact the seller they will send you some converting software and tips FYI )One thing I want to add is it says MP4 but when transferring songs from iTunes, iTunes for the most part is MP4.. For some reason even though this player says MP4 it WON'T read them.. So you have to convert the songs from MP4 to MP3 ( easy process in iTunes search Youtube for the process ) Once you have the songs transferred in MP3 format they will play.. Videos transferred don't play for me.. My downloaded movies are in MP4 and I haven't followed the instructions emailed to me by the seller for converting that, too much work , but the screen is a little small for that or reading books )After your music is transferred that is it! I walk daily and was bringing my phone with me ( which is nice ) but my phone is bulky and I love having a lightweight music player, and I don't have to worry about dropping my phone ! The controls are a little hard to get used to. The middle button will prompt volume and you can use the arrows to adjust. To get back to the main menu when in a category like Music press and hold the Menu button.. If you forget to turn it off after a few minutes of inactivity it will turn off ..Another negative for me is the charger.. It's a USB charger that is old school so you have to remember to keep it charged as the newer micro charging ports won't fit.. II did receive at no cost for this honest review from the seller but I am happy with this player for what I am using it for. Its basic, no thrills but works great now that my music is converted to MP3 !!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABVP4Q1Z0KM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168FQZ5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ABVP4Q1Z0KM9","A3094EPI56GKZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3094EPI56GKZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this eye mask!  I have not used a eye mask like this for a long time and it's really nice after a hard day at work.  I have used it both ways. Headache relief works better for me when its warm, and I just spray with water and place in the Microwave for 30 seconds. If I have a pressure headache using it cold is best but it has to be placed in the freezer for recommended 2-3 hours and planning ahead is hard for my pressure headaches!I have placed in the freezer for 24 hours as I forgot it was in there. It still worked fine stayed colder longer but that will eliminate the lavender fragrance faster with long freezing times.

Either way I am happy with my results and will use again after surgery as gas is a bypass of Gastric Sleeve surgery :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R364CGU9KKDY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R364CGU9KKDY0","A3094EPI56GKZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3094EPI56GKZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are super pretty LED lights!  I love the smaller bulb its a classic and extremely cool look compered to the bigger bulbs for solar lights we have been using.  We have had out now in our yard for a month and depending on the amount of full sun ( we live in Seattle some days there is just clouds and rain )  they are extremely pretty and stay lit till sunrise.Keep in mind if its cloudy or rainy like we have had the last few days the lights might only come on for a short while at sunset..  We have experienced that many times.  If you live in a area that gets a lot of sun you will have beautiful warm solar lights all night but for us its weather dependent :)  We are still happy though with them and they are totally rain resistant!

"These are really cool headphones! I have been using with my Xbox 360 but have been using more with my work computer.  I can listen to music AND take calls from customers through our voice over IP which is a awesome plus! My work gave us headphones but these are much more conformable and instead of taking my headphones off and putting on my work headphones for calls this is all in one for me!I have never worn headphones that have such a nice vibration effect and option.  That is really a new experience for me and I like that the volume and vibration switch is easy reach and to adjust.  The bass and noise cancelling effect is spot on as well! I am super impressed with these headphones- Multi use for taking calls, listening to music and videos and my gaming.  The blue light is a cool effect.  You can easily turn it off but its a cool option!I did receive at no cost in exchange for this review but I am totally thrilled with this headset!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMDD4DC1CIAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","RXMDD4DC1CIAA","A3094EPI56GKZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3094EPI56GKZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love the one arm concept as well as I sometimes don't feel comfortable wearing a backpack over both shoulders, especially going short distances and I usually wear over one shoulder anyways so this is perfect!It came with a black bag also for storing your yoga mat which I really like, especially in Seattle where it rains often it will keep my mat dry when walking to my class!

From the beginning it reminded me of what is going on in many countries with their civil and race wars.. From there it picked up as a mysterious book with the guidance of his loyal Arabian horse..

"Two tablets a day these vitamins have been keeping me feeling strong and healthy the last month. The bottle is a two month supply if taken as directed. I take with a meal but I have taken hours after eating and my stomach feels fine.  I would continue purchasing this supplement if the cost was more affordable.  I take a similar womans supplement that is half the price for a two month supplement so it's important to shop prices although the price might drop ( currently at almost $27.00 )Otherwise nearing fifty I am very happy with the way I felt.

"The Lenovo Tab 2 A10 10.1 inch tablet is a great tablet with great performance. I have 8 apps running as well as some other services and everything is very fast.  It has a full HD 1920x1200 resolution screen, which is very nice with a quick touch response.  The CPU is a ""lightening speed"" 1.5 GHz 64-bit ARM MT8165 with 4 cores.  It has 2GB LPDDR3 memory and 16 GB of internal storage.  The tablet also accepts a MicroSD card for up to 64 GB of additional storage.  I'm using a SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card Up to 48MB/s With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Newest Version], but there is a 64 GB version.  The tablet came with Android 4.4.4 (KitKat) but was upgraded in mid-July to Lollipop 5.0.1,  The wi-fi is fast (Dual Band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n + 5GHz 802.11a)).  The rear camera is 8 megapixels (with 4x digital zoom and movies) and the front camera is 5 megapixels. It does have GPS for using maps and other apps that use your location.  Lenovo states the 7000mAh Li-ion battery life is 15.5 hours of mixed use. Over 3 hours I played a movie, a game, and used some apps and the battery went from 100% to 78%.  An optional Bluetooth keyboard is available.I deducted one star for audio performance.  Reportedly it has a multi-speaker Dolby Atmos Cinematic Moving Audio system.  Lenovo states ""This unique technology delivers a profound audio experience that seemingly wraps itself around you.""  However I can't tell that the Dolby Atmos audio is doing anything. The Dolby app doesn't respond. The speakers are in the back and it certainly doesn't project the sound to the front of the tablet. The headset volume seems OK, but the speaker volume on some Youtube videos and my personal movie collection is so low at maximum volume that I had to install the Speaker Boost app to increase the volume.Wow, the AnTuTu Benchmark general performance test results indicate that the Lenovo Tab 2 10-inch tablet has ""rather high performance, surpasses 95% of other devices.""  For gaming performance the benchmark indicates that it has ""high game performance, surpasses 60% of other devices."" (These benchmarks were for both KitKat and Lollipop.) The flight simulators that I've played run great.I don't know if the tablets currently being shipped are running KitKat or Lollipop.  But my upgrade experience was very good and I have not noticed any performance degradation on the Lenovo tablet with Lollipop.  I can't say that for my old Nexus 7 tablet.The performance is great and the price is very competitive.  I'm going to buy one for my wife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMYEGFY91X35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05L9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1QMYEGFY91X35","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I compared these Scott Choose-A-Sheet paper towels to the Bounty Paper Towels, 12 Select A Size Big Rolls.  The individual sheets are very similar in size:  the Scott towel is 7 inches by 11 inches wide and the Bounty is 6 inches by 11 inches wide.  The Bounty paper towel feels thicker.  The Scott towel weighs 0.07 ounces and the Bounty towel weighs 0.08 ounces.For a test I placed each towel in a bowl of water and let it totally soak up as much water as possible.  Then I pulled the towel out of the water and held it by one corner for 30 seconds.  Both towels had only a slow drip after 30 seconds.  I then weighed it again and deducted the original weight of the paper towel.  The Scott paper towel held 0.4 ounces of water by weight.  The Bounty paper towel held 0.65 ounces of water by weight. So the Bounty Select-A-Size paper towel held 62 percent more water by weight than the Scott Choose-A-Size paper towel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REM3ADLYWS2DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6YJ1IU#wasThisHelpful","REM3ADLYWS2DS","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oscillococcinum is great for the flu.  Last week I felt like I had come down with the flu.  I had fever, chills, digestive issues, etc.  I felt really sick.  About two hours after I started feeling sick I remembered to take a dose of Oscillococcinum.  That was in the evening.  The next morning when I woke up I felt a whole lot better.  I felt a little run down but the flu symptoms were gone.  I took 2 more doses that day just to be sure that it was cleared.  So I would say that it worked very well.Homeopathic remedies have a vibrational effect.  They impact the physiology of the body in a very specific way.

"This Easy Gardener netting has been the solution I was looking for to prevent birds from crashing into our windows.  We had a cardinal that kept attacking his reflection in the windows.  I put this netting up and it's about 2 inches from the window glass.  So now the cardinal can't get to the glass and has left.

"The Fintie Lenovo Tab 2 A10 Case fits the Lenovo tablet very well.  There are holes in the right places for the controls, speakers, camera, etc.  It automatically turns on the display when you lift the flap and turns off the display when you close the flap.  The flap has 3 sections and you can fold them into a triangle and prop up the tablet for viewing movies,etc.  There is a magnet in the last section of the flap and when you fold it into a triangle it snaps into place to keep it locked in position.  Also when you rotate the tablet vertically you can hold onto that triangle and it gives you something to hold onto.The only thing I didn't like is that when I first got it it had a rather bad odor.

"The Shark Rocket Hand Vac has really good power.  It weighs about 4 pounds with the power vacuum attachment and has a 15 foot cord.  There is not a cord holder so I end up just wrapping the cord around the handle.  There is a filter in the top of the Shark and It is easy to dump the contents in the bottom.  Because of the smoke colored plastic you can easily see when it needs to be dumped. The power vacuum attachment has a 4.5 inch wide brush that spins.  The head of the power attachment will also rotate to vacuum a vertical surface which is convenient if you want to vacuum the front side of carpeted stairs.  The other two attachments are a brush (non-powered) and a pointed crevice tool.  There is also a flexible hose that can stretch from 17 inches to about 5 feet.  However this hose is not powered so it won't spin the power attachment if you were to connect it.  The Shark Rocket was pretty good for jobs like furniture and the comforter.  But for floors you'll have to bend over to use it and I found that the 15 foot cord was too short for the whole room.  For the car the Shark had a lot of power for the carpets and mats but I had to get out an extension cord, which I don't have to do with a cordless vacuum.  I used the power vacuum attachment for the carpets as much as I could and it did a great job, but I kept having to switch out the attachments again and again  With the power vacuum attachment the Shark is 21 inches long, so there were places in the car that I couldn't get to because of the Shark being too long.  It's also 21 inches long with the non-powered brush, so I had put on the flexible hose to reach some places.  The Shark is a lot more powerful than my cordless vac but it can be a bit more of a hassle to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ITCVUGQEK3M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9Z36T8#wasThisHelpful","R3ITCVUGQEK3M3","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Hoover Commercial CH53010 Bagless vacuum has a lot going for it.  I would give it 4.5 stars.  It has a HEPA filter and an indicator when it is time to clean it.  It's bagless and it is easy to dump the contents.  It cleans well on both carpets and hard surfaces.  The cleaning path is 13 inches, which may be about average.  It is pretty easy to push around.  It weighs about 15.5 pounds when the electric cord is unwound.  The cord is extra long (about 40 feet) so you don't have to change where you have it plugged in quite so often.  It doesn't have an automatic cord winder if that is what you are looking for.  It also does not have a motorized attachment for vacuuming furniture if you need that accessory.  It just has the standard 2 attachments, one with a brush and one with a narrow tip, plus a plastic extension tube.  It is easy to access the belt and belt roller if they need to be serviced.  There is also a window to view the belt.  Overall it's a nice vacuum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXF89TWU4SIAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO9VLLW#wasThisHelpful","RXF89TWU4SIAI","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Black & Decker 5 Minute Pizza Oven was provided to me by Amazon for my evaluation of it.  I also received a letter that ""testing samples"" had unfortunately been sent to reviewers rather than the production models. So hopefully Black & Decker has fixed the problems.  The letter states that the heat distribution and flimsy crumb pan have been improved.In my test I baked a Digiorno rising crust pizza in the oven.  I followed the instructions for a rising crust pizza, which stated to preheat the oven and then bake the pizza for 10 to 14 minutes at 600 degrees.  After 12 minutes the front of the pizza looked like it needed additional cooking time but the oven was smoking, so I pulled the pizza out.  The front of the pizza needed another minute or two, while the back of the pizza, which I could not see while it was baking, was burned and smoking.  (See the photo I uploaded.)You may not want to select this as your primary oven.  It is not very versatile. The controls only give you options for temperatures of 350 and 600 degrees.  If your recipe calls for 425 degrees, you'll have to experiment with baking times. There is no light in the top of the oven to watch the baking progress. The timer is not very loud.  The timer only goes to 30 minutes.  The internal dimensions are approximately 12.25"" x 12.75"" by 2.5"" so anything larger than that is going to be an issue.  And the metal crumb tray is easy to bend when you wash it and difficult to slide back into place.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGWOI59SEW15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R2GGWOI59SEW15","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personal is Lee Child's version of The Day of the Jackal.  While there wasn't always a lot of action there was the suspense of possibly being shot by a sniper with a grudge from more than 1,000 yards away.  I actually thought it was pretty well written and better than his 2013 book Never Go Back (Jack Reacher). Or at least I was thinking that for the first two-thirds of Personal, and then things changed.  I don't know if Lee had to meet a publication deadline or what, but the quality just dropped off in some respects.There was one scene (Chapter 46) where it seemed like Lee must have been smoking something.  It must be the worst scene in all of his books.  I don't want to make this a spoiler, so I won't give many details, but the scene goes like this: Reacher and his lady friend's plan is to kidnap a VIP who is in a car leaving his house. The front car has the VIP, his driver, and 2 armed bodyguards.  There is another car right behind it with 4 armed bodyguards, so a total of 6 armed bodyguards, maybe 7 if the chauffeur is armed.  Reacher figures he has 3 seconds to do the job before the 4 armed bodyguards in the second car can jump out and react.  Reacher's car pulls in front of the VIP car to make it stop before pulling into the street.  Then Reacher's internal stopwatch starts. Reacher jumps out of his car, runs to the VIP car, opens the front and back doors, holds a gun to the VIP's head, has a linoleum knife in his other hand and makes 2 cuts to the seatbelt of the armed bodyguard sitting beside the VIP, leans into the car and gives a backhand elbow to the far side of the bodyguard's head which knocked him out of the car, then shuffles sideways and reaches up into the front seat and makes 2 cuts to the seatbelt of the bodyguard in the front seat, leans into the front seat and gives a backhand elbow to the far side of the bodyguard's head which knocked him out of the car, then turns and kicks the first bodyguard in the head, and then kicks the second bodyguard in the head.  Reacher now runs back to his car, jumps into the drivers seat, puts the car in gear, moves his car out of the way, then jumps out of his car and runs back to the VIP car. Now 4 seconds have elapsed and the 4 bodyguards have just jumped out of their car.  Not even Tom Cruise could do that in 4 seconds.  If reality were not suspended, Reacher would have been filled with multiple bullet holes.  End of the Jack Reacher series.  All I can think of is that it must have been Superman.  Is there any other explanation?I would say that I did like the ending, so the last third of the book wasn't totally FUBAR.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIONX10J4JYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178755#wasThisHelpful","R2IIONX10J4JYL","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great book which helps you to learn dowsing.  Dowsing is not just about finding water.  There is far more than can be done with dowsing beyond finding water or lost objects. Raymon Grace explains how you can also use dowsing and the alpha state to change the frequencies of energies and therefore change your health, wealth, and the future.While this is a 5 star book, I would point out that this webpage is incorrect when it states that this book is only available from 3rd party sellers.

The author explains that to heal some people or to clear the houses that they lived in, some ghost busting was required.

"This first generation Google Nexus 7 tablet was a very nice tablet.  I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.  I never really had any problems with it.

The new email app in Lollipop frequently says there is no connection although the wi-fi icon at the top of the screen indicates that there is a good connection  and Chrome is connected.

"This 3M car care kit has 7 products plus 5 microfiber detail cloths. It includes a car wash soap, quick wax spray, a wax protectant, leather & vinyl restorer, wheel & tire cleaner, lens & hard plastic cleaner, and a scratch remover. I used the lens cleaner on 10 year old headlight lenses and it worked good. 3M says it will remove minor scratches but it didn't remove some scuffs on the lenses.  The leather restorer didn't do any restoration and I didn't think it worked as well as Armor All. I sprayed on the wheel & tire cleaner, left it on for a few minutes and then washed it off at the car wash. I couldn't tell that it did anything, but then the instructions say that you have to use a brush (not included).Also not included are safety glasses, rubber gloves, and a respirator mask. There are warning labels on all 7 of the products regarding their health hazards. Some may cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, dizziness, headaches, & nausea. Avoid eye and skin contact and breathing vapors. Some vapors are combustible, so it is not advised to smoke while using them. Do not intentionally concentrate and inhale the contents, may be fatal. The scratch remover states: ""Do not get on skin. Skin contact: remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Immediately flush skin with large amounts of water. Get medical attention...."" It also states the product VOC (volatile organic compounds) is less than 17%, which means it may be 16.9%. I decided not to use it. Some other reviewers have commented that Amazon does not allow returns of these automotive products because they are ""hazardous materials"". There are other car care products on the market that do not have these health warnings, such as Armor All 25178 Ultra Shine Wash and Wax - 16 oz. Nu Finish Liquid Car Polish, Meguiar's A1616 Quik Wax - 16 oz., MOTHERS 05924 Foaming Wheel & Tire Cleaner - 24 oz, Nu Finish Scratch Doctor, and Turtle Wax T-240KT Headlight Lens Restorer Kit.My recommendation would be to consider the other car care kits that are more user-friendly such as possibly the Meguiar's G55032 Complete Car Care Kit.

"I didn't get the impression that the Kobi LED bulb is as bright as a 100 watt bulb.  I put the Kobi bulb into a lamp on an end table which has four light levels.  Using a light meter app on my Android phone, the following four light levels were reported:  40, 76, 115, and 159 lumens.  The color seems a little weird too--which another reviewer indicated was a blue color.  I had been using a GE cool white (made in Mexico) 90 watt incandescent bulb in the lamp.  The light meter app gave me the following four light levels for the 90 watt bulb:  11, 64, 159, and 265 lumens.  So the brightest level on the KOBI bulb was shown as only 60% of the 90 watt bulb.  I'm not saying that the light meter app has the highest accuracy, but I believe that it did give a good comparison of the two bulbs.  One reason that the light meter app wasn't showing anything like the 1600 rated lumens for the Kobi bulb can be attributed to the design of the LED bulb.  The lower half of the bulb is pretty much solid plastic.  The vanes or fins on the lower half of the bulb are apparently for cooling.  So all of the light is directed upward.  Using the light in a table lamp, most of the light is directed towards the ceiling rather than down onto what you are reading.  I had my phone lying on the table surface for the 4 readings so that it was consistent for all of the readings.  When I held my phone up at the top of the lamp it was hard to get consistent readings.  I got readings in the 1000 to 1400 range near the top of the lamp depending on exactly where I held my phone.  If I had held my phone closer to the bulb the readings would have been higher.Be advised that if you're using the Kobi bulb in a table lamp and you're trying to read something, you may find that the level of light is insufficient.  .","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5I9V3AFQ9Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUDHA2#wasThisHelpful","R1R5I9V3AFQ9Z4","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw John Walkenbach's name (AKA Mr. Spreadsheet) on the front cover but yet he is not the author of this book.  I've read a couple of John Walkenbach's Excel VBA books from cover to cover and he is a very good writer for those wishing to learn Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  I found out that John Walkenbach is the Series Editor for a series of Excel books such as 101 Ready-To-Use Excel Macros, Microsoft Business Intelligence Tools for Excel Analysts, and Excel Dashboards and Reports.The 101 Ready to Use Excel Formulas is the lightweight book on how to use Excel formulas. It is just over 200 pages long and does not include any VBA or custom functions written by the user.  The comprehensive Excel formula book written for the professional that also includes VBA and custom functions is John Walkenbach's 800 page Excel 2013 Formulas.  This 101 Formula book is about the same price as John's 800 page book, so you get a lot more with the book that John Walkenbach authored.Some basic points about the 101 Ready to Use Excel Formulas book:  The introduction states that the ideal candidate for using this book is someone who has some Excel skills such as doing basic data analysis, using tables, aggregating data, performing calculations, and creating charts.  You should have Excel 2010 or 2013.  The book does not provide any explanation as to any differences in Excel 2007 or earlier versions.  (Note that John Walkenbach's Excel 2013 Formula book states that it is for Excel 2013 as well as 2010 and 2007.  John states that if you have a version of Excel older than that then you should consider one of his earlier books on Excel formulas to avoid confusion.  (Excel 2007 was the version that Microsoft introduced the somewhat controversial ribbon menu.))  There is no CD included with the book but page 4 gives a webpage where you can download the sample files.What types of formulas are included in this book?  The book covers a wide range of Excel formulas on topics such as calculating percentages, running totals, divide by 0 errors, counting values, and conversion tables (such as miles and kilometers).  There are text functions or formulas for joining text strings, extracting parts or a text string, substituting characters in a string, and formatting numbers in a text string.  There are date and time formulas such as calculating the number of work days between two dates.  There is conditional analysis, such as sum the values that meet a certain condition.  There are lookup formulas to lookup values in a table, finding values using multiple criteria, and alternatives such as Index and Match.  There are common business and financial formulas such as calculating profit margins, break even points, depreciation, net present value, loan payment calculators, and amortization schedules.  There are statistical calculations such as mean, median, and mode, smoothing data, frequency distribution, and trendline forecasts.  Lastly there are formulas with conditional formatting such as highlighting cells that meet certain criteria or highlighting values that are in list 1 but not in list 2.  There are only a couple pages relating to array formulas.Here is an example of the format of the book:  Formula 48 is Sum All Values That Meet a Certain Condition.  A simple statement of the issue is given, such as you want to sum all of the negative values in a column of a table.  The formula is =SUMIF(C3:C12,""<0"").  A screenshot shows the formula and result.  An explanation of how it works is given.  Each argument in the formula is explained, as well as options.  Another example and screenshot may also be included.  Alternatives are also given, such as constructing the criteria in a SUMIF statement.So there is a broad range of formulas in the book that you might find useful in improving your Excel capabilities and saving time.I thought the book was good but a bit pricey with a list price of $39.99, even though it is well discounted by Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAXBJUCVLH44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118902688#wasThisHelpful","R3PAXBJUCVLH44","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A dock is a stand that holds your phone upright and has an integrated charging/syncing cable just like the cable that came with your iPhone.  So the dock doesn't really do anything that your original charging cable doesn't do except hold your phone upright so that you can easily see it or access it. The Belkin is a nice dock.  It has a solid feel to it.  Plug the dock into your computer's USB port and it will charge your iPhone 5 (or iPod Touch 5th generation) and sync it--the same as plugging your phone into your computer with a USB cable.  The dock has some weight and has a nice feel to it.  However when you begin using your phone while plugged into the dock, you will find that your phone and the dock may tilt back as you sometimes press on the screen.  That is to say that the base does not remain flat on the table.  And unfortunately the Belkin dock does not come with a power adapter to plug it into the wall, so if you don't have a USB port you can't charge your phone with it.  And it may not work with your phone's case.  The box states, ""Compatible with open base cases.  For best results, remove case to dock.""Unfortunately iTunes is pretty much the only game in town for syncing your iPhone. Some people have described iTunes as malware.  Anyway, iTunes would not sync all of the apps.  Then after it synced everything I wanted to see the pictures that were uploaded to the computer and delete some of the pictures on the iphone.  There's no menu option for that--or if there is, it is well hidden.  I did not deduct any stars from my Belkin dock rating for iTunes.Belkin typically makes good products.  (I think sometimes Belkin gets a bad rap because other sellers list cheap knock-offs on the same Amazon page and then Belkin receives bad reviews for those knock-offs.)  But at $35 (or $27 on another Amazon webpage) this dock seems over priced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TZV7739K9X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJI4U#wasThisHelpful","R25TZV7739K9X1","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe that this is a Belkin product.  I thought their products were supposed to be better than the cheap junk that you can buy from China.This Belkin case does not offer much protection for the iPhone 5C.  It's just a hard plastic case that doesn't fully cover all of the phone's edges.  And for $8 you don't get get any screen protection.  You can buy a similar case on that big auction site for about $2 (I'm not allowed to give the site name).  If you really want more protection for you iPhone, try something like the SUPCASE Apple iPhone 5C Unicorn Beetle Dual Layer Case - Black/Black, Compatible with iPhone 5C/iPhone Mini (2013 Version). It's only a couple dollars more than this piece of plastic.If you have a $2 phone, buy a $2 case.

" 1:26 MinsThe stock fan on my AMD Phenom II (AM3) CPU started going bad, so it was time to shop for a new CPU fan. There were a number of higher priced CPU fans that probably would cool the CPU down more, but they had one thing in common. They all needed a backplate to be installed on the back side of the motherboard. (Maybe there were some other fans better than this that didn't have this requirement, but I didn't find them.) With my CPU case I have access to some areas of the back side of the motherboard but not where the CPU is located, so I would have had to have pulled my motherboard out of the case in order to install one of those fans. I've built a number of computers but was not in the mood to pull this motherboard. Enter the Logisys MC2002GX. It costs about $20 or less and I decided to give it a shot.The CPU fan installation was fairly easy. (See my video for instructions. For the best viewing, click to view full screen. Pause as necessary. The video shows how to remove the stock AMD CPU fan and install the new fan. The last two frames on the video are for Intel CPU's only.) The only tricky part was the last step when I had to push the fan down firmly onto the CPU, align the mounting bracket and then clip the mounting bracket over the plastic tab next to the CPU. But once you get that done you're finished. And normally I use a better thermal paste when I'm installing a CPU fan, but in this case I opted not to remove the thermal paste that comes on the fan.The CPU fan is pretty quiet. It has been keeping my CPU temperature between 29 and 42 degrees C. The high temperature was shown when I had all 4 CPU cores at 100% usage.No complaints at this time.NOTE: This CPU fan will work with more CPU's than are listed in the description. See the picture that I uploaded that shows the full list of CPU's on the side of the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2DFS9N2QBOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WLRKJO#wasThisHelpful","R2J2DFS9N2QBOH","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My osteopathic doctor recommended these Wholemune capsules.  I took them when I was having some sinus problems and they helped my immune system to respond.This is what the Ortho Molecular Products website says about Wholemune.  ""WholeMune is formulated with Wellmune WGP, the most well-researched, single beta-glucan, proven in clinical trials to prepare and protect the immune system from repeated and ongoing stressors.  Wellmune® WGP is a highly purified, yeast-free beta-glucan extract derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; it is standardized to contain 75% pure beta-glucan and is considered to be the most effective single nutrient to naturally prime immune cells to enhance immune function.  WholeMune’s primary active ingredient is Wellmune WGP®- a natural beta 1,3/1,6 glucan derived from the cell wall of a proprietary strain of baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Once swallowed, immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract take up Wellmune WGP® and transport it to immune organs throughout the body. Specific immune cells called macrophages digest Wellmune WGP® into smaller fragments and slowly release them over a number of days. The fragments then bind to neutrophils (white blood cells), via complement receptor 3 (CR3).  Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in the body, accounting for 60-70% of all immune cells. The activation of neurotrophils by Wellmune WGP® fragments allows these cells to move faster throughout the body, resulting in a significant boost in immune defense.""A UK reported stated the following:  ""A new nutritional product called beta-1-3, 1-6-glucan is one of the most exciting things happening today in the field of nutritional supplements.  Obtained from purified yeast, beta-1-3-glucan has a long scientific history and a reference list including literally hundreds of papers. Research originated in the 1940's when Pillemer and his colleagues described a crude yeast cell wall preparation, Zymosan. They reported that this material was able to stimulate nonspecific immunity. It was unknown at that time which element of this composition, containing a relatively crude mixture of proteins, lipids and polysaccharides, actually activated the immune response.  The answer came later in the 60's, when Dr. Nicholas DiLuzio at Tulane University experimented with beta-1-3-glucan2 . In the late 1980's Dr. Joyce Czop, at Harvard University, described the mode of action of this material in stimulating the immune system: there is a specific receptor for beta-1-3-glucan on the surface of certain cells, called macrophages3 that when activated, stimulate a cascade of events turning the body into ""an arsenal of defense"".  April 28th 2014 - the most recent research confirms the safety,efficasy and immunomodulatory effect of beta-glucan 1-3, 1-6 in humans.  A clinical human trial published January 23rd 2013 in the European Journal of Nutrition, based on a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentric study in healthy subjects, suggests beta-glucan 1-3, 1-6 helps prevent colds, improves symptoms and increases the body’s potential to defend against invading pathogens.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMWW5KXH714U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA7L2XQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GMWW5KXH714U","AF03NDXR2PIFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF03NDXR2PIFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this food chopper! I am always in the kitchen cooking something or other, and we use a lot of diced peppers, celery, carrots, and onions for casseroles, soups, salads, stews, stir fry, etc. so I spend a fair amount of time chopping things! This food chopper is awesome, very easy to use with just three components, and you can get your vegetables / fruits finely diced with a few extra pulls, or just rough chopped depending on what you're using them for. I was able to fit half of a large onion in the bowl, and with about 14 pulls I got good, pretty evenly sized rough chopped onion pieces, with another 10 pulls I got pretty well minced onion.

"I received a bottle of this pet odor & stain removal spray to review and it is something that has and will continue to come in VERY handy in my house! We have 3 dogs and 2 kids - so between them all there is pretty much always a stain on my carpets somewhere needing treatment; especially when it rains and the dogs track in red Georgia clay, and leave behind that lovely wet dog smell which seems to soak right into the carpet. The before / after picture I included is after only a light spray and dabbing a few times with a cloth. No soaking for long periods of time, no scrubbing. Most of the stain came right out with very minimal effort, and the scent left behind was actually fairly pleasant, not chemically like many of the stain treaters we've used over the years. I think this is a great, and effective stain removal spray, and I LOVE that is made from a 100% natural and non-toxic formula!I received this product in exchange for an honest review based on my personal experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YERV4T2WRXRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWE5CPE#wasThisHelpful","R2YERV4T2WRXRL","A294WFOP4GFH0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A294WFOP4GFH0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good quality, sturdy stainless steel pastry cutter. The only negative I found with this cutter is that the blades are a little further apart then I would like, meaning you have to work a little harder to get a finer crumb when cutting butter into your flour; that said it is nice and sturdy, the grip is very comfortable, the blades are a good sharpness and thickness to do an effective job of blending butter into flour.

"4 starsI used the Sketch It Nail Pens Salon with a six year old and an eight year old who are big fans of manicures. The set comes with 5 polish/pens, a sheet of tiny gem stickers and another sheet with stickers you can color in with the pens. There are five colors of polish, and we all agreed that they are pretty colors. The polish goes on easily, although the green/yellow was a little thin so it required two coats and it also took a little longer to dry (this seems to be a problem with many green polishes). The other colors dried pretty quickly which was awesome with kids. The pens are under a cap at the top of the brush - they act as the handle for the polish brush. After some initial fumbling on paper, we realized you have to squeeze the middle of the pen in order for it to draw. It’s a super fine point pen and worked great! We wrote letters on their nails and colored in the decals. Worked very well! The gem stickers are tiny but really cute. They’re nice colors, too.The set comes with a tiny needle discretely stuck to the bottom of the wand for unclogging the tip. The directions tell you about that, otherwise it might easily be missed. Word of caution - It is *very* easy to accidentally unscrew the cap of the polish while trying to remove the cap to the pen. This spells disaster for kids or anyone not paying careful attention. All in all, I think this kit is a very good value and makes a nice addition to a home manicure set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHIFQSP0D5ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV0XVDQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CHIFQSP0D5ZS","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel didn't measure up to past books in the Rosato and Dinunzio series, which generally has offered ""quick reads"" with focused plots, interesting characters, and insightful to the workings of our legal system. This book focuses on Bennie Rosato, the founder of a successful Philadelphia law firm, with very little interaction with her business partner and legal staff. The first half of the book starts in the present day when she is asked to represent Jason Leftkavick, a client  in his early twenties who she  represented in a juvenile case ten years earlier. It then goes on to give details of that case as well as a personal love relationship that she developed with Declan or  ""Mr. Right"" as Lou, her firm's investigator, referred to him. The second half describes the current trial of her client and the return of her  paramour. Bennie is conflicted about her feelings about the man she thinks she loved/loves as well as the legal system and its dispensing of  ""justice"".  I liked the main story and related characters and I liked the insights into Bennie's thoughts while presenting her client's defense, but Bennie's personal love relationship was unrealistic  and overdone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYQ5903DOD0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250027934#wasThisHelpful","R1GYQ5903DOD0Q","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Falsies"" is quite a provocative label for a product like mascara, and prompted me to order it just because it prompted a smile. Anyway, it promises to deliver the thick, upturned look of false eyelashes, which I tried a couple of times when I was young and foolish and nearly glued my eyelids shut. I can't say that this mascara mimics the look of professionally applied ""falsies""' but it does go on neatly and provides a lusher appearance than your basic mascara.

"Wow, this is a big, hefty bar of soap, which must be why it's billed as for men. But Irish Spring has always been advertised for men (remember the Irish lass saying ""But I like it too""?) Well, I like this one too. The scent is lighter than that of the green bars, refreshing without overpowering. It doesn't seem to do much in the exfoliating department, in spite of the flakes of oatmeal dispersed throughout. But it doesn't seem to have a drying affect on skin, whether used on body or face.

"History repeats itself at an estate high above the shores of Lake Garda, where a century ago, renowned playwright Galeazzo D’Ascanio wrote a drama, considered to be his masterpiece, expressly for his muse, actress Celia Sands. She disappeared without a trace on the eve of its opening, leaving him broken and bereft, and locals believe that she has haunted the estate ever since. Now his grandson, Alessandro, has endowed the property to a historic trust, and as a final tribute to Galeazzo, he plans to stage the play for the public before relinquishing the villa. For the leading lady, he has engaged a fledgling English actress, another Celia Sands, who with trepidation accepts the role and travels to Italy for rehearsals. At the villa, she is assigned the very same room once occupied by her namesake, whose portrait hangs above the bedstead. Celia’s nervousness about taking on her first starring role is exacerbated by tales about ghostly encounters, and the fact that two household staff members are missing adds to her uneasiness. When some unsettling incidents occur, she tries to chalk them up to imagination.Season of Storms unfolds at a leisurely pace. It’s clear from the outset that events from the past will be mirrored in the present, so the book relies on characters and the process of staging a play as its center. Character development is uneven, however, and it’s unfortunate that Celia remains a reactor, passive and unsophisticated. Although she will come to feel real fear, the reader never does. Part mystery and part romance, both story lines fall a bit flat in spite of the spectacular Gothic setting in which they play out. What works somewhat better is the gradual reveal around modern Celia’s own family history, which is cleverly plotted and does come as a surpriseSusanna Kearsley’s books have been compared to those of Mary Stewart, which is fair, and I’m also reminded of Daphne DuMaurier (excepting the incomparable Rebecca).","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXKIPXXFX5LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JX1GLUA#wasThisHelpful","R3BXKIPXXFX5LR","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The detergent is fine but it received an F in online safety ratings. I think that’s really scary.I typically use one of the free and clear detergents because I’m very sensitive to fragrances and will often break out with contact dermatitis from them. Because I occasionally feel nostalgic for the freshness of fragranced laundry, I thought I’d try this one to see how the lavender scent was. From the bottle, it doesn’t really smell like lavender but isn’t unpleasant and after drying my clothes, I really couldn't smell it at all. It did seem to perform well - my clothes were clean and I haven’t had any skin reactions.

"Richard Papen is chronically depressed, a loser in his own eyes. Penniless, he leaves his native California and his dismissive parents for Hampden College in New Hampshire, where he hopes to reinvent himself. Still very much a fish out of water, his knowledge of the language of ancient Greece eventually comes to the attention of the school's elite, a group of five wealthy students who study all things Greek under the tutelage of distinguished scholar Julian Delgado. To Richard's astonishment and delight, he's invited into this exclusive coterie. Soon, as a result of the mythology and philosophy in which the students become immersed, one of the group will die at the hands of his fellows. This is the secret. As narrator, Richard's job is to guide readers along on the journey that leads to murder and its inevitable tragic aftermath. This is the history.The Secret History owes much to such classic forerunners as Crime and Punishment, Brideshead Revisited, and Lord of the Flies, as well as the body of Greek Mythology. To the credit of its author, however, this mystery cum coming of age tale is no mere derivative.This is an accomplished first novel. Yes, it has its problems. The plot, though certainly compelling, is not complex enough to warrant nearly 600 pages, and it drags in places toward the middle. Readers who expect to ""like"" the characters will probably not like The Secret History; while they each possess a level of intellectual brilliance, morally they are bankrupt. Self-appointed elitists, the totality of their self absorption will ruin them all. Except for Richard, whose self-contempt paralyzes him to the point that he watches their actions as though watching a game or a movie. But Ms. Tartt is spot on in her portrayal of the 1980's texture of life at a small town college during a snowy winter, well enough to invoke some nostalgia for my own college days. While revealing the secret in the prologue saps the story of suspense, knowing what will happen evokes a strong sense of dread that grows as the plot plays out, rather like watching a snake from a distance when you know it might strike. Rather like we do whenever any heinous act splashes itself across our television screens.Fascinating work by a talented writer.

"These capsules worked perfectly in my machine. Though not as full flavored as the description claims, I found the flavor relatively smooth and not too acidic or bitter. It definitely gives some strong competition to my favorite, Nespresso. One of our European friends, a die-hard espresso fan who prefers Nespresso in lieu of a ""really good"" espresso, also tried it and was pleasantly surprised. At nearly $1 per pod, it’s pricey, almost 30 cents more than Nespresso pods. It appears these capsules may be recyclable in my area and that would certainly give Puroast some extra points in our book and also softens the blow of the higher price a bit. In the end, the price alone will likely deter me from adding it to my capsule lineup… BUT, the scientific claims regarding much lower acidity and high concentration of antioxidants (more antioxidants than green tea) appear legitimate and sound, so if your stomach is usually irritated by coffee (or if you don’t mind the price), I think you should definitely consider this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4NFRR4ASHSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5M2PEY#wasThisHelpful","RA4NFRR4ASHSR","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the design of this double hook a lot. The non-slip design makes it better than nearly every over-the-door hook I’ve owned! The spring arm gave it a secure fit against the door without the bouncing I’ve had with other hooks. I think this will keep it from scuffing wood or paint effectively.

"Ordered this for my daughter, and here's her opinion:I’m a long time vegan protein powder user and I was pleasantly surprised by the Vega One All-in-One Nutritional Shake, chocolate flavor. The nutritional profile is great, and the taste was much better than I expected. I made a straight up shake with coconut-almond milk and it blended nicely. I shared it with a couple of family member who aren’t big shake drinkers and even they enjoyed it. My only complaint is it’s slightly chalky if you mix it plain, but when you add some fruit in the blender with it, it’s a little smoother and much less noticeable. I have been using vegan Plant Fusion up until now, but this is a viable contender for my protein powder rotation. Next time I’m having a chocolate or sweet craving, I’m going to blend it with the coconut-almond milk and some ice for a dessert shake.

"""All Day And A Night"" is the latest in Alafair Burke's series with  NYPD Detective  Ellie Hatcher and her partner JJ Rogan.  It is another fast paced, easy read.  The characters are easy to  like or hate, and also include a few that you aren't so sure about. The story plays out like a good movie in your head, with twists, turns and surprises,  just as all good books do.In this case, the NY District Attorney's Office has received anonymous information, following the murder of a prominent  psychotherapist, that suggests that a serial killer who was believed to be in jail, may still be free.  This leads to the possibility that someone may  have been falsely convicted of  a crime that he did not commit. Under the authority of the DA's office,  Hatcher and Rogan are paired as part of the ""Fresh look"" team to investigate whether an innocent person has been incarcerated and to also find the killer of the psychotherapist.

"Funeral Music is the introductory volume to the Sara Selkirk Mysteries. Sara is a world renowned cellist who has lost her will to perform following the sudden death of her husband. But that is not the mystery in Funeral Music. Sara's well meaning friend and accompanist, James, cajoles her into playing a charity concert at Bath's famous Pump Room, after which she makes a horrifying discovery. Someone has stabbed to death the museum curator, dumping his corpse into the Roman baths, and Sara is the first to find him. He wasn't a very popular or principled individual, and there are any number of possible suspects. The investigation falls to Sara's cello pupil, DCI Andrew Poole. The plot thickens when Andrew falls for her, and when James becomes a suspect.This is a simple enough plot with enough interest to permit its competition with the setting, the spectacular city of Bath. Each of the main suspects is given his or her own chapters, and it doesn't become clear who did it until very close to the end. Along the way, a couple of imaginative yet believable alibis liven things up, but one of those alibis proves to be a cover. I was truly surprised when the murderer was finally revealed. Will Sara return to the concert stage?

"England, in the aftermath of The Great War. Few soldiers who fought in France returned unscathed, and Alastair Gellis and Matthew Ryder are no exceptions. Deeply affected by their experiences in the killing fields of France, they have decided to make a study of death and the afterlife by researching and writing about spirit manifestations. Their current case involves trying to rid the Falmouth House barn of its angry, often violent ghost, that of a servant girl, Maddy, who hanged herself there several years ago. Because of some girlhood trauma, Maddy cannot abide men, so Alastair arranges to hire a female assistant. Sarah Piper ekes out a living as an employee of a temp agency, so when she’s sent to interview with Alastair, she cannot resist the chance for a bit of adventure, not realizing that much more will be required of her than simple transcription.Simone St. James’s description of Sarah’s first encounter with Maddy is atmospheric and chilling, and she spins out this tale in an effective Gothic style. The ghost hunting team quickly recognizes that, before they can hope to calm Maddy and send her on her way, they must ferret out the source of her terrible rage. Interestingly, each of the three comes to encounter her in very different ways, and by comparing their experiences, they begin to tease out the truth. The author enlivens the remote country village setting with good period detail and an array of very English characters, ranging from the new owner of the manor house to the suspicious inn keeper to the surly churchyard sexton. Having recently read, enjoyed, and reviewed Bellman and Black, in which crows play a prominent and symbolic role, it was pleasantly surprising to me to encounter crows in this book as well, fulfilling an even more active function. Maddy’s ghostly behaviors are anything but trite, and while Sarah’s budding romance (I won’t say with whom) could easily have detracted from the book’s central theme, it was well integrated into the plot as a whole. Alastair, Matthew, Sarah, and Maddy herself emerge from their brief but intense relationship quite changed.The Haunting of Maddy Clare is an impressive debut novel. If it has an outstanding flaw, it is that some of the characters telegraphed their implication in Maddy’s mystery. But the overlying ghost story maintained its appeal, and readers who enjoy modern Gothic will probably enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNAZF4TLROIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451235681#wasThisHelpful","R3QNAZF4TLROIX","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pasta is a tasty alternative to white pasta, similar in texture to Barilla’s whole wheat pasta. We prepared it with olive oil, garlic and sautéed vegetables and were happy with the flavor and texture. We didn’t really notice much, if any,  veggie flavor from the pasta itself. Our family of carb lovers all liked the idea of consuming “one full serving of vegetables” hidden in our pasta. However, on closer inspection of the nutritional label, I’m not quite sure we’re getting much more nutrition per serving than we get from regular white pasta. The only differences are some vitamin A (30% RDA), magnesium (8% RDA) and phosphorus (15% RDA). I thought there would be more added value than that in a “full serving” of tomatoes and carrots. Regardless, I suppose any extra vitamins are a good thing and the color is a nice change up from white or brown. I’m sure we’ll use it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFL67QJS180S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA6NW#wasThisHelpful","RKFL67QJS180S","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Livy Jackson seems to be a normal person to whom most readers can relate. Life isn't easy for Livy right now.  Her family  is in turmoil. While her 7 year old boy, Zack, is still an ""angel"",  12 year old Hannah is spewing  contrary behaviors and attitudes filling the house with tension. Worse still, Will, Livy's husband, has had and may still be having an affair,  is  rarely home due to his demanding job, and  is irritable when he is at  home. Life hasn't been easy for Livy. She feels guilt involving the unsolved death of her younger sister, Kara, from 18 years ago as well as the resulting breakdown of her relationship with her parents. To make matters worse,  now  a close friend, Julia, appears to have committed suicide, and a disbelieving Livy wages  into a personal battle to prove that Julia was murdered, contrary to what the police are saying.While the story was interesting, it was not very believable. There are too many people that Livy can't trust. Too many places that she investigates without getting caught. Too much investigation without police involvement.  All this while still trying to hold her family together.A quick read that is enjoyable if you can suspend your sense of reality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKFHAQ4RFH36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033993#wasThisHelpful","R1PKFHAQ4RFH36","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"W is for Wasted is the 23rd in the Kinsey Millhone series. Twenty third! While most series and their characters grow stale after a while, that's far from the case with Kinsey. To say Sue Grafton has honed her craft is an understatement. Among her many awards are the Grand Master Award from Mystery Writers of America, and Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Over the years, I've read and enjoyed novels A through V, but W is her masterpiece.Kinsey's now 38, still unattached, still living the simple life with few encumbrances. And it's still the 80's in her home town of Santa Teresa, CA. As the book opens, she's asked to identify a dead homeless man who carried her name and number in his pocket, but she's never met him before. Since she's between cases, Kinsey's always active curiosity spurs her to find out what she can about the man. She also learns of the death of a sleazy PI whom she did know but didn't like or trust. Too much free time can be a dangerous thing when you're K.M.Author Grafton incorporates the usual stock characters, whom her readers have come fondly to know well, and adds some interesting new ones, especially Ed the cat, some heretofore unknown cousins, and a trio of homeless people who lead her on quite an adventure. This is an intricate plot written on several levels with several disparate threads, and it's a joy to observe how deftly Grafton is able to consolidate them by book's end. It's impossible to decide whether plotting or characterization, dialogue or description, is her outstanding forte, she's so good at them all. If you like mysteries and haven't yet had the pleasure of meeting Kinsey Millhone, treat yourself to W is for Wasted. It's not necessary, though it is fun, to read this series in order. Sue Grafton's Grand Master and Lifetime Achievement Awards, and all the others she's been presented over the years, are richly deserved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID7LY9CC6YJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594137889#wasThisHelpful","R1ID7LY9CC6YJI","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up using Mead Five Star notebooks and always hated how the pockets would eventually rip with use but am happy to see they are reinforced now with a tape-like strip around the top inch of the pocket, including the seam of the pocket. This should solve that issue. Plastic front covers are nice, rich colors and seem durable. The back covers are thick cardboard which looks like it will be durable, too. My only complaint is that the paper is thinner than I remember and my gel pens bleed through too much to use on these pages.

"Sometimes it really is true that fact is stranger than fiction. You know those little men in the pointy hats that we generally refer to as garden gnomes? They now have a history. You know those classical little “folly” buildings that dot the stately English garden landscape? Well, it turns out that some of these were not strictly decorative.  Gordon Campbell, a Professor of Renaissance Studies at the University of Leicester, has published The Hermit in the Garden: From Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome , the first book to describe the phenomenon of the ornamental hermit in Georgian England.Professor Campbell believes that during the Reformation, the ancient custom of religious persons, sometimes called hermits,  choosing to shut themselves away from the world for constant prayer and meditation came to an end with the dissolution of the great religious houses.  During the 18th century, it became fashionable among the educated and the elite to be “melancholy”, devoting time to the admiration of nature and the study of philosophy. Gradually, some began constructing small rustic cottages, to use as retreats for deep thinking, or, in many cases, to impress visitors with their erudition. It wasn’t long before the wealthy began to  hire men to live in their garden “hermitage”, pretending to be a reclusive but romantic part of the landscape. Although this book is a serious and impressive work of research, Professor Campbell injects threads of humor where appropriate, as when he describes the difficulties inherent in finding men willing to don rough robes, go barefooted, allow their hair, beards, and nails to grow, and, perhaps hardest of all, remain silent, for a period of seven years.Much of the book is a survey of historic and modern “hermitages” in England, Scotland, France, and parts of Europe, many of which are illustrated. There are numerous extant sites that can still be visited, though they’re no longer inhabited; health regulations prohibit! It ends with some speculation about how the ornamental garden hermit morphed slowly into the ornamental garden gnome, helped along by Disney’s Grumpy, Sleepy, et al.It’s probably safe to say that there is no  more extensive compilation of information on this topic than The Hermit in the Garden. It’s a valuable addition to the field of garden history, and has much to say, or imply, about Western Civ.Now I must search out the perfect gnome for my own garden.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLHQN7J23LH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198700865#wasThisHelpful","RLLHQN7J23LH6","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cary Grant portrays Mortimer Brewster, a famous arts critic who marries the girl next door on Halloween. He returns to the Brooklyn home he shares with his two maiden aunts to pack for his honeymoon (at Niagara Falls, of course), when he discovers a corpse in the window seat. Mortimer is shocked to learn that his sweet old aunts have been poisoning lonely old men with arsenic laced elderberry wine,  and burying them in the ""Panama Canal"" that Teddy has dug in the cellar. He spends the rest of the movie frenetically trying to have Teddy committed, in the hope that if the authorities should happen to learn about the bodies in the basement, they'll blame it all on Teddy. Midway through,  long lost, psychopathic third brother Jonathan appears on the scene with his plastic surgeon and another corpse in tow.Arsenic and Old Lace was released in 1944. It's in black and white and  very much like the stage play that inspired it, but when viewed as a period piece, one of the ""madcap comedies"" of the time, it doesn't come across as dated. Cary Grant bears the weight of the plot, and he's brilliant. It's a joy to watch him convey a full spectrum of emotion in a ten second sequence of facial expressions.  Raymond Massey plays the role of Jonathan, who becomes enraged whenever anyone mentions his resemblance to Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre that of Dr. Einstein, who keeps promising to make him look like someone else. The aunts, some cops, Mortimer's new wife, and the sanitarium director make frequent appearances to move the story along.In spite of its macabre theme, this is very much a comedy, with lines that hold up quite well some seventy years after they were uttered. Great fun, full of laughs, and vintage in the best sense of the word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6M5D7G3CM2J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045HCJHG#wasThisHelpful","R6M5D7G3CM2J0","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this charger on both an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 6 and am very happy with it so far. It seems to consistently charge both phones quickly enough for me - about 10% in 10 minutes. My iPhone 5 is in a LifeProof Nuud case and the plug fits fine without removing the case, which has been an annoying issue with other cords in the past. My last charger would also occasionally give me issues charging and gave me the warning that it wasn’t a certified Apple product. No issues so far with this charger, which I was hoping since it says it is Apple certified.I like the lower profile of this charger as well as the general feel of it. Not a big deal but it’s nice that it doesn't feel bulky or cheap like so many of them do. Yes, the green light is bright and yes, it annoys me at night, just like my previous charger’s blue light (what’s up with the bright lights?!) My fix is to just rotate the plug so the base of the USB cable blocks most of the light. Usually I’m not leaving it in for the duration of my drive anyhow. I’m just happy it works like it’s supposed to.At $13.99, I consider this charger a good value, especially considering it comes with the cord.

"Someone is killing baseball superstars. There's another players strike underway, and the self proclaimed Vindicator wants to teach a lesson to the greedy, overpaid sob's who are ruining the sport, players and owners alike. Randy Larkin, insurance agent, is basking in the satisfaction of having successfully taken down a cop killer,  when news about the baseball murders breaks and grabs his attention. Now Randy starts to think about becoming a real PI, and is itching to tackle this case.Once you accept the premise that the FBI would actually accept assistance from rank amateurs, Three Strikes and You're Dead takes on momentum. Working under the supervision of a licensed PI mentor, Randy, his brother Graham, and soon-to-be girlfriend Rosanne soon find themselves hot on the trail. The narration alternates between their efforts and those of the Vindicator and the terrorist who controls him. The feature that most grabbed my attention was the use that the novice investigators made of social media, especially Facebook, by setting up a discussion page about the crime and asking speculative questions of the participants. The plot moves along briskly and reaches its culmination in Grand Central Station.The author, an online friend and fellow Connecticut resident, provided me with a copy to read and review objectively. I'm glad I did. The decency and unpretentious attitude of Randy Larkin makes him a refreshingly appealing character, and, since this is his second outing in a Mike Draper production, I hope there's a series in the works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Z0KSH19UN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499049307#wasThisHelpful","R25Z0KSH19UN3","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery labels are almost always the most convenient choice for whatever I'm working on. I love the texture and shape of these scalloped labels and I plan to use these in several ways to add some whimsy to otherwise dull projects and packaging.Now, printing? That's another story. I've never had an issue with downloading templates, but there aren't any for this one! Avery pushes you into the online design program on its site. I was irritated with the thought of having to play around in attempt to get what I already had designed in Illustrator. Apparently, the solution is to save the file as a .jpg and upload into the online program as an image. From there, you can save the file on your computer, but you have to open it online via the Avery program. Very frustrating. I ended up downloading a template for a similar round label which took some maneuvering & measuring to get right, but I'd rather not need to deal with going to the website just to print labels. I printed a bunch of test prints on paper to be sure I got it right. Why can't I just have a template? ARGH!Of note, the templates they provide are not business-professional and more suited to someone who wants a cute design or something casual or for kids.  I just wish that since Avery is forcing us into this program they offered some designs that were a little more sophisticated or suitable for a more serious, polished business feel.Since I've gone throughout the effort of essentially creating my own template, I'm sure I'll love the labels going forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I7NO8SIQEAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZL23MY#wasThisHelpful","R17I7NO8SIQEAV","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the 1700's, most Americans relied upon linen for their everyday textile needs; cotton had to be imported and was costly enough to be considered a luxury fabric. By 1830, however, the invention of an efficient cotton gin and the emergence of Southern cotton plantations led to a reversal in that state of affairs. But what if an efficient flax gin had been invented first?Jodi Lew-Smith has written a historical coming-of-age tale built around that question, set in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Ella Kenyon is an unusual young woman, one who feels more at home in the woods than the town. Her beloved grandfather, a blacksmith by trade, has helped her develop an unusual talent for engineering, and together they design a machine that can extract linen fibers from the plant. When her grandfather dies suddenly, Ella is determined to perfect and patent their flax gin. The Clever Mill Horse is the tale of her struggle to achieve that goal. On her long journey to Washington City, she must face countless obstacles, among them forest fires, horse thieves,  accidents and illness, and unscrupulous lawyers. Before her journey ends, Ella will discover the truth about who she really is and why.Ms. Lew-Smith fills her story with vibrant characters, vivid descriptions, and realistic dialog. There is even a role for a real inventor, Oliver Evans. Does Ella achieve her mission? Yes and no. Now that so many things in her young life have changed, in what direction will she head? This book, the first in a promised series, is suitable for adults and young adults alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS51E1VGXQ74R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991341201#wasThisHelpful","RS51E1VGXQ74R","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author of Dark Digital Sky contacted me to ask if I'd be interested in reading and reviewing his new novel. Techno-thrillers are way out of my preferred genres, but I agreed to give this one a go, and I'm glad I did. The 21st century version of the brilliant but deeply flawed investigator has arrived in the persona of Chalk (Chaucer). He's bipolar but doesn't take his meds properly, mixing in a touch of alcoholism and much emotional baggage, which he has no idea - none whatsoever - how to handle. But he's an accomplished hacker, and was recruited and trained by the FBI, although that career tanked quite early. But his new PI gig pays better, and he always delivers.As the novel opens, Chalk has been hired by the Hollywood Hyena, on obscenely wealthy megalomaniac. The Hyena is dying and now wants to meet the offspring he sired via the sperm bank. Chalk locates and stalks three of them, all male, using up to the minute technological tools. Not one of sons is what you might call smart or  pro-social, and each has been recruited by a sadistic terrorist. The reader enters this world along with Chalk, who certainly knows how to find his way around in there. Along the way, he encounters Bacchus, who seems to be a vicious serial killer who kidnaps young women. Among Bacchus' personal foibles is the cannibalism which he inflicts upon unknowing others. This is a complex plot that moves along briskly, and you never know what might happen next. I know there is an vast audience of readers who would enjoy this book; I found the story line very intriguing, and Chalk is certainly an interesting kind of guy (Chalk would love Lisbeth Salandar), but it's spattered with the sorts of violence that I don't like to have floating around in my mind.A promising start to what promises to become a popular series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJ60G2EEA5QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC4L5VO#wasThisHelpful","R1CJ60G2EEA5QR","A3NLJZI5NEOT0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NLJZI5NEOT0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The High Price I Had To Pay by Jamila T. Davis is the second book I have read from this author. I enjoy books about crimes that are true. There is nothing like a true story to really make you think. I remember  when the big mortgage/bank fraud thing was going down and a lot of people got caught up in it. Jamila T. Davis was one of them. She was convicted of bank fraud, for her role in a multi-million dollar bank fraud scheme, and sentenced to 12 1/2 years in federal prison. Most of the real culprits never saw the inside of a prison.Most people wouldn't have been able to come back from that. But Jamila is sharing her story and bringing light to a lot of things some of us were not privy to when all this was going down. It may have been a tough lesson, but after reading this I think the author has become a stronger person for it creating a series of books geared towards women empowerment.

Once you realize you are a creative force of your own and you control the nature of your being from which each situation grows then you will master the life you lead.This adaptation of A Man Thinketh is something to read and take to heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0FE7YT5QECX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CJLU3S#wasThisHelpful","RG0FE7YT5QECX","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have watched this movie a few times now. And I just loved it. You see what it is to be a teenager in a world where the need to be popular and social media rules. It really touches on some very deep subjects. I think every teenager should watch it. The acting was amazing. It is very deep and truly thought-provoking.

"A Light Within (Three Keys Book 2) by Dana Alexander was a good read. I read the first in the series Beyond a Darkened Sky back over the summer. And I was thrilled to get my hands on the second one. In this book, we pick up again with Sarah Forrester and her protector Kevin still looking for the three keys.I think this book flowed nicely. I was glad I had read the first in the series prior to this one. So I knew exactly what was going on. The characters are well developed and the plot keeps you drawn in with lots of action, sci-fi, suspense and love. Dana Alexander has created a beautiful world with her words for us to get lost in.

"The Monster Chase, by Marion A. Stahl, was an interesting fictional account of the multitude of problems that seems to be running rampant in our healthcare system right now. When I was a child growing up I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be able to help people but after reading this I am thankful I chose something else. There is so much that goes into being a doctor outside of actually practicing medicine.The story follows a doctor who  unfairly of persecuted for insurance fraud.

Lillie has  been carrying secrets all this time. She has abilities. Men seem to just be taken with her. After an incident in the woods, she meets Kyle.

"I have been waiting forever for this movie to come out. I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I actually did. It only gets 3 stars from me, and that is only because that 3 way was freaking hot. It was something just off about it. Keanu Reeves acting was over the top like overacting. I am not sure if that was intentional or not, but it was less than stellar. I also guess Eli Roth is going to become one of those directors who always casts his significant other in his movies since she is all so be starring in Green Inferno. Lorenza Izzo is hot so I can see why. Her acting and Ana de Armas wasn't that bad but Keanus was just not good. This movie keeps getting compared to Hard Candy and it isn't even close to being in the same league.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204T4TP8XPRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016D5Y0H4#wasThisHelpful","R204T4TP8XPRB","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And When by Wendiann Proteau drew me in especially with the well written and developed main character Jade Prency. Jade as many of us has been dealt a series of life smack down blows.

I love the correspondence between her and the people she connected with online.What I loved most about this story was how it pulled you in emotionally.

"The Heartbeat Thief by AJ Krafton is my kind of story. The story takes places in 1860 following Senza Fyne. Senza has it all. She is smart, beautiful, young, wealthy and well connected. Yet in this time the only thing a woman had to do was find a suitable husband, but Senza is preoccupied not with life and all that lay before her. She is focused on what is to come...death. With people dying all around her. She begins to worry about her own mortality. Enters Mr. Knell a man who can help Senza maintain the life she so craves, but at what cost.The character of Senza was well written. And I was drawn into her story completely. I may not have taken the route Senza did, but I understood where she was coming. I really enjoyed the story. It was a little slow in some areas, but overall it was a great. It was so easy to get sucked in.

I read love stories occasionally, but they aren't always my first choices, but the fact this book had a historical backdrop I was drawn to it. The story is of two star-crossed lovers Hughes and Cotta who find each other in a war-torn Britain.This is book one in the Hepsom Abbey Saga. There is a plethora of twists and turns in this story. A story of love, loss and more. The characters are well developed. And the historical background is just the icing on the cake for me.

"Doomed Soul by Robert Boomsliter was an interesting and unique read. The book is based on the authors thoughts on religion, morality and death. I was very curious on what the author had to say. I grew up in an African American deep south Baptist church. As soon as I turned 18 and was given the choice to give up church I did. I saw nothing there, but fire and brimstone and hate. All these things in the name of God. While sitting there in a church filled with hypocrites.I felt for a long time like a doomed soul. You see all these horrible acts being committed all in the name of religion. So I could see where the author was coming from in some aspects. Some things I agreed with other things not so much. But I felt like he was sharing something of himself, not forcing his views. And I could appreciate that because there is nothing worse than someone forcing their views on you.

This causes the government to collapse and billions dead. Leaving those left to have to fend for themselves.The book is very fast-paced, and the characters are well written.

Her description of their Mediterrian location is vivid and pops out in your mind as you read. The story is about Luke and Tessa. Tessa is so over men and doesn't trust them at all. Luke is rather casual and non-committal. They are pretty much opposites. And you know what they say? Opposites attract. It was an adorable and engaging romance.I am happy to have read Love in a Cala. It was very enjoyable. You can never go wrong with a good romance. I really look forward to more from this author in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2HSRG5GBFU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NHQSLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L2HSRG5GBFU7","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love in a Boat: A Mediterranean Romance novel by Carla Prince was a real delight. I was able to read this cute little romance novel in one sitting. If it is a good romance I can plow right through it, and this is a very good romance.Kate is a boat, lover. She prefers older boats with character. She hasn't had much experience with men when she and her lovable pooch meets Flynn and his luxury yacht. Flynn who is definitely an alpha is not really in the market for love. But the more he gets to know her the more the chemistry ignites between them.This a really sweet romance novel that is a quick read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I can't wait to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HVKV41WVDJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NH6WR6#wasThisHelpful","R2HVKV41WVDJ9","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Birth of an Assasin is the second book I have read by Rik Stone, the first being The Turkish Connection. Rik Stone has a gift for telling a story. The words jump right off the pages as you are reading. You can sometimes feel as though you are right there in the action. And I love that about his books.Birth of an Assassin is an action-packed thriller set in Moscow, Russia. The story follows Jez Kornfeld who runs away to become a part of the Russian military. He has wanted this for  a long time. He ends up being taking in by a high ranking officer and becomes a trained assassin.I really enjoyed the book. It was filled with action, drama, suspense, intrigue and more. The author really seemed to know what he was writing about.

"A friend recommended and loan this book to me One Before Bedtime by N.S. Johnson. My friend is well aware how much I like odd and out of the ordinary stories. I wasn't sold initially because  it was a collection of short stories. But the author did a wonderful series of short stories. Stories from various genres such as ghost, fantasy, mystery, suspense and fantasy.The title One Before Bedtime was spot on. I look forward to coming home reading one, or sometimes two or three before bedtime. But if you are not one for this type subject matter. You may want to read it way before going to bed.I really enjoyed each story. I was happy this book was recommended. If author N.S. Johnson's goal was to keep me up half the night.

"Floyd Merrell author of Looking Glass Killer: Volume II: The Matthew-Matt Trilogy was good but not exactly what I was expected. I was intrigued immediately after reading the synopsis. I thought I would give it a chance. I love anything dealing with serial killers or crime.The book is about a psychopathic serial killer, and the two cops Detectives Mike and Lucia who are devoted to bringing him in. The killer is fond of leaving puzzles, clues and riddles for the officers. But is it enough to catch the killer?I did finish the book, and for the most part I enjoyed it. However, it did seem to drag in certain areas. If I really like a book I will breeze right through it, but this one I would point it down for a day or so before picking it up again.

"Occasionally I have problems with acne and blackheads. And I never really knew how to handle it outside of popping and squeezing them which most times only make the problem worse. I did a little research and had heard these kits were very useful. I received this product as a promotion in exchange for an unbiased review. When I received it I was very excited to try it. Upon opening I realized there were no instructions and that was kind of a bummer. But it wasn't hard to find information and videos online on how to use the tools in the kit properly.

"I borrowed this book from a friend. She recommended it. I really love this book. It is a total thriller. Send Flowers by Mike Crowley kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. I noticed a lot of reviewers referred to this book as John Grishamish, and I couldn't agree more. I guess that is why my friend recommended it. She knows I am a big John Grisham fan.The story is about a man named John Griffin who manages a pharmaceutical lab. His lab goes is set on fire because company executives realize the disease they are creating a cure for is more profitable with without the cure. So the executives have the lab set on fire. Griffin and a few from his lab end up on the run because they have been placed on a terrorist kill list by the company they once worked for. They find themselves on the run from military, CIA and other US agencies. And while on the run they are still trying to develop the cure.I love how fast paced this book is.

He is a Catholic Priest.The author wrote this book in such a way that the word just jump off the page. It is rare to find humor, romance, suspense, intrigue and more all wrapped in one book.

"When I received this I couldn't wait to go on a picnic or get near the water. We ended up using the blanket at the beach. And I love it. I don't particularly like going to the beach because I don't like getting sandy, and it seems like you get the most sand from sitting on the beach blanket. I was impressed with the size of the blanket 3 of us fit on it easily.The pouch it came in is awesome. I couldn't believe how big it was when I took it out of the little carrier pouch. There are loops on the ends for stakes or hanging depending on what you want to do with it. I think this is probably the most versatile blanket I have come across. I have nothing but good things to say about this product. It dries quick, sand doesn't stick to it, it is versatile, it is a nice size and comes with a carrier pouch where you can fold it up and take it where ever easily.

"That's My Love Story by Santosh Kalwor is a unique story not what I expected. But I tend to enjoy books that aren't what I expect at first glance. I thought it was a beautifully written story of one man's personal journey. It was like taking a glimpse into his soul. The story is about Prem a young boy from Nepal who has gone through a lot. He was bullied relentlessly growing up. He has gone through many failed relationships leaving him lonely and depressed to the point of being borderline suicidal. Prem decided to climb the mountain cliff to jump off. On the way going up, he meets a wise old man who walks and talks to Prem. From there it is a journey of discovery for Prem.I found this book to more of a motivational type of thing. I enjoyed it very much, and I felt for Prem.

"She's All Caught Up by Jamila T. Davis is a thought provoking memoir. I read this book in one sitting. It resonated so much with me. Jamila grew up in a good home with hardworking parents who would do anything for her. She was intelligent and creative. Everything changed when Jamila hit 16 as a lot of us do from the pressures of still being a child, and wanting desperately to be looked at as an adult.Jamila's memoir gives us a detailed account of her rise and fall. And when she came crashing down she crashed hard. The memoir is written from a prison cell where she was sentenced to 12.5 years for bank fraud. She was so caught up in having materialistic things, power, independence, and notoriety. She acquired all those things for a while but making poor choices caused her to lose it all.I found this book to be a wonderful read. It gripped me from beginning to end. I may not have gotten as far out of control as Jamila, but I could have easily been her. Because I made some extremely poor choices in my life. And I can appreciate anyone who uses their life experiences to inspire and empower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YY8Y3V74M94T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKJBL74#wasThisHelpful","R1YY8Y3V74M94T","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book is masterfully written over a period of decades and told by well-written characters with different life experiences during the same period. It takes a look at people during various periods wealthy, poor, black and white. I have to note the use of the N-word but keep in mind that this was a common occurrence during certain time frames in the book. I love books that take you back in history presenting a realistic vision of it.The characters are well developed. Groat is very good at writing to make the words on the page come to life.

"Apocalypse Beach Party: Stories by Warrington Jeffreys is an interesting ensemble of stories. I was able to read it in one sitting. I thought this would be an interesting read, and it was. It is a collection of very short stories that deal with the apocalypse in some form or fashion. I enjoyed that the stories were relatively quick to read. However, it seems a couple of the stories ended too quickly like almost in mid thought. But there were a couple of stories enjoyed very much. My two favorite stories were The Peter Brady Story and The River Phoenix Fan Club. If you want a quick read, and something a little out of the ordinary. I would recommend this collection of short stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80W31NYCAIEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMFVT12#wasThisHelpful","R80W31NYCAIEH","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the first in the series, I was excited for the second book in the series.  Untouchable (Elite Doms of Washington Book 2) by Elizabeth SaFleur was just as good as the first book. I was enthralled within the first few chapters.Untouchable (Elite Doms of Washington Book 2) follows Carson Drake a D.C. corporate attorney and London Chantelle.  London works for Carson Drake's in public relations. They have a chance encounter at a BDSM club, and from there it is an opportunity for Drake to make London his. London commits to 48 hours of sensual pleasure with Carson. What was supposed to be a weekend of sexual lust and exploration appears it could be something more.I love these books so much. You will find a few characters pop up from book one in this book. However, these books can be read as a standalone. And I like that fact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YRU7ACAQRXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8CZ3KG#wasThisHelpful","R6YRU7ACAQRXH","A1W6DWSDVJS43Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W6DWSDVJS43Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is wonderfully unique and adventurous in its story line. Taking place on a cruise ship, Marsha and Danny are hired by the cruise line to provide security. But troubles they face aren't merely rowdy passengers; the cruise is a magnet for pirates and terrorists alike, throwing the two ex-secret service agents. I found the vivid descriptions and knowledge about the ports of call and cruise ship procedures fascinating and added a great layer of depth to the story. The action was intense, and the two main characters did some serious damage to the pirates and terrorists. The president even gets involved, which just shows how serious the plot becomes. This is a great maritime detective/thriller/action novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXSM9KAXPOB97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S9VLGC#wasThisHelpful","RXSM9KAXPOB97","A1CEQW43SECZNC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CEQW43SECZNC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read pretty much every HGW book. The Sherlock books were the first to get me into this mysterious authors fantastic alt-history writing. After those, I started in on the Monte Cristo ones (which had been published first) and immediately dove into this one. This one had a healthy dose of action, especially the Battle of Bull Run chapter!  That's what I love about HGW's books; he/she weaves historical moments into a memorable moment that humanizes history far more acutely than an history book (though liberties are taken obviously). There was some nice romance sprinkled in the book to when WW2 hits.

This one boasted a tough female detective that got results and did everything in her power to solve her cases and catch the bad guys, even against her bosses orders.

"I have to say right off that this light shows way too much dirt and grime all over the house. I know our house isn't anywhere close to being spic and span, but this little UV light really showed me how dirty it is. :-(  We don't have pets so that would have made it even worse. I hadn't realized how many things actually glow using a UV light (see photo of my slippers). It's kinda fun going around the house with the light. It does need to be pretty dark for the light to show up; you won't be able to see near as much in the daylight (and that might be a good thing; lol).The main reason I wanted this UV light is because we live in scorpion country and over the summer I have killed two scorpions in my bathroom and both times were at night when I wasn't really sure what I was seeing. Fortunately both times I was smart enough not to bend down and try picking up what I thought was a dust bunny; yikes! So I have been keeping this little light in my bathroom for those trips during the night when most of the lights are off and I think I see something on the floor. Unfortunately, or fortunately however you look at it, I don't have a photo of a scorpion showing up in this light, but if I do find one I'll definitely post a photo (after killing the scorpion of course).One thing to make you aware of is that this light takes 3 AAA batteries that are not included. I had not realized that and when the light arrived I had to order batteries for it. The batteries go inside the light and to turn on or off the light you press the button on the end.Product provided for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZRUEHDMCLOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PQZASU#wasThisHelpful","R3GZRUEHDMCLOF","A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F9CMU8KNAY1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hubby has been wanting a car charger that also shows the car battery voltage, so when I was contacted by HAWEEL to evaluate their product for my honest review I jumped at the opportunity. The car we use this on has the cigarette lighter/power port in the middle console so it's easy to see the battery voltage, especially since the plug is flexible. With the car running the voltage was 14.2 and when the car sits it shows just the battery voltage, which is now 12.0 (see photo).The charger shows to plug in iPad/Tablets on the left port and a Phone on the right port so there's no guesswork (you can see on my photo that the ports are named; the USB cord is covering up the ""Phone""). Definitely recommended for someone who wants to know what the voltage is of their car battery, plus as an extra bonus you get a 2-port USB charger.  :-) So happy to have this nifty little device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTUA2RM7XNTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZA1E3IE#wasThisHelpful","R2GTUA2RM7XNTW","A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F9CMU8KNAY1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have other cable management sleeves, but this is one has a unique design that I hadn't seen before. There were no instructions included. The thread guide looks a little confusing at first, but looking at the ""how to operate"" photos on the web page and also watching a video on how to use it cleared up any confusion.My first thought in getting this was to wrap my battery cables going to the battery and the winch on my Jeep. But after receiving it, I felt the plastic was too thin to withstand the heat of the engine compartment. :-(So I set out to clean up the mess of wires behind the TV. After unplugging wires and using the guide to insert them in the tube, the area looks much better. The thing I found out, is the more electrical cords you try to insert in the tube, the tougher it gets. The guide rubs on the insulation of the cords and makes it harder to push the guide forward. If you can bundle the cords together it should work better. It is easy to use once you have figured out how to do it.I have to give this 5 stars, mostly because of the guide; it's well thought out.Product provided at a substantial discount for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDPKWQIKDG5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8LNBM2#wasThisHelpful","R1GDPKWQIKDG5A","A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F9CMU8KNAY1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's see, what can you say about a spray nozzle besides the fact that it works. There are 10 settings to spray water out of this nozzle. There is also a brass knob to regulate the amount of water the nozzle puts out. Being made of metal, this nozzle should last a long time if proper care is taken. I like the feel of the metal handle in my hand rather than the plastic ones I have had in the past. Plus the rubber handle makes it more comfortable and so far it hasn't dripped. It comes complete with a rubber gasket, so all you need to do is screw it on the hose.

I'm keeping the box in our pantry.I don't like anything peanut butter; fortunately my hubby does so he eats the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and the first time he had one he said he thought it was full size. The rest (Almond Joy, Kit Kat and Hershey's milk chocolate bar) are snack size; each one is good for a couple bites.I think this candy box would be good for Halloween; there's 90 little individual wrapped candies and that would be enough to treat a lot of little goblins. They're also good for when I need a chocolate fix; of course I can't eat just one. It's a nice idea when you want some candy for a group; other than that it seems pretty expensive buying it this way when you could buy the individual bars for less.The Hershey's chocolate bar in the box reminds me of the time we toured the Hershey factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

"My husband and I have different hearing levels, so watching TV can be a little loud for me, or a little low for him. A BrighPlay Live HD Bluetooth Transmitter made our TV Bluetooth capable so he would able to listen through Bluetooth headphones.  By pressing the power button on the headphones until they flashed red and blue they paired with the Bluetooth transmitter, but it did take a few tries.  Now that it's paired it has always connected when he presses the button and they have stayed paired longer than the last headset he had.The headphone audio is very clear, and there is no lag in the audio from the TV to the headphones. They are adjustable and fit well over his ears; the headband is a little narrow and puts a little pressure on the top of his head and he adjusts that once in a while. He wears them for maybe an hour or so, takes a short break, then puts them back on. There's a blue light that blinks every once in a while to let you know they're still working. When the headset it turned on you get the message ""Power on"" and the ""Power off"" message when you turn them off so you definitely know they're off. As far as the life of the battery, it looks like about 15 hours before they need to be charged, which is a lot of TV listening. If there's a message saying ""Low battery"" he doesn't know because he charges them sooner than that.His intent for this headset is only to listen to TV shows and the sound is great. The headphones are now the only way he will watch TV. He does have another headset but since receiving this Sentey he has only used it; he prefers it over the other.

"This meat thermometer is not only a thermometer but can also be used as a timer and is also a fork that can be used to remove your meat. First you need to install the 2 enclosed batteries on the back (the battery cover also has a cooking chart on it so you know what temps your different meats are supposed to be). The thermometer I had been using was a simple dial thermometer with a single probe and it worked but I was always wondering whether I was going to stick myself with it. This ThermoPro has a digital readout that not only gives you the temperature, but also lets you know when the meat is rare, medium or well done. It also has a backlight. It does take a few seconds to come up with the final reading after you put the probe into the meat.What I did find out the first time though is that's it is not waterproof; somehow it ended up in the sink with the rest of the dishes and got all wet. Fortunately it dried out but now I know not to do that anymore.George Foreman and I do a lot of inside grilling and I'm pleased with my new digital thermometer.  :-)Product provided for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLYIYWNCPLK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ADY65O#wasThisHelpful","R1XLYIYWNCPLK0","A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F9CMU8KNAY1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a set of 3 interchangeable handheld magnifiers. I was surprised to see how large they were when I received it. The handle itself is 4"" long and 4 1/2"" around. The large lens is 3 3/4"" around. For the light to work you need to install 3 AAA batteries (not included). The three lenses are pretty easy to interchange by pressing in on the button on each side of the the handle that releases the lens.The one I use the most is the smallest one and I actually thought at first that the images were upside down. I even wrote the company and received a very nice reply with the following explanation: ""the object distance should be less than one focal length, then you can see an enlarged upright image (virtual image). If Object distance is more than one focal length less than twice the focal length, it will show an enlarged inverted real image.""  I tried it again and realized I was holding the magnifier too far away; the small one needs to be almost on top of the print or just slightly above; if it's any higher than that the image is inverted. I wanted to be sure and write that so others wouldn't make the same mistake I did.I do a lot of knitting and crocheting an am using the smaller one for patterns.

"This kit has everything needed for whitening teeth. It comes with 6 mouth trays and 9 syringes of whitening gel. Even included is the whitening light, which I see in some kits is extra. Plus this is the least expensive kit I have seen!First you need to form the mouth trays to your teeth by putting them in hot water for a few seconds and then putting them in your mouth (make sure they're not too hot!). They recommend you try wearing the trays first before putting in the whitening gel; I did that once and that was enough. The first time I put the trays in my mouth with the whitening gel I still had the handle on the mouth trays and couldn't figure out how to put the whitening light in my teeth. Well duh, that's because the handles are for when you heat up the trays to form them to your teeth and then you're supposed to cut off the handles when you use the whitening gel (a step that was missing in the instructions); then you can use the whitening light (you first need to open the battery compartment and pull out the strip so the light will work).It recommends 5 to 15 minutes at a time using the light and possibly leaving in the mouth trays for longer. I've been using the gel and light for about 15 minutes each time and then removing everything. Whether or not the light really helps bleach the teeth faster and whether or not it's beneficial is a controversial subject. Make sure you brush all the gel out of your mouth when you remove the trays. The web page states to NOT brush your teeth before the treatment; the instruction booklet that came with the kit states to brush your teeth well beforehand. I'll go with the brushing first.I'm not doing it every day, but I have used a couple of the syringes full of whitening gel so far and I'm on the third one. I did take before and after pictures; I think I can tell a little more sparkle on my top teeth. I need to work more on the bottom teeth. I still have almost 7 syringes left to go, so should definitely be able to tell a big difference.For this price of this kit for all you get it's a bargain. Even teeth whitening strips cost more than this kit.

"Theses silicone gloves are huge!  They come in one size; large (that's what ""free size"" must mean). I received a red pair. They don't bend much like traditional gloves, and because of that they're a little tough to put on and it's hard to feel comfortable holding something hot because the mitts are so thick and stiff that you may not really feel you have control of the hot dish you're holding. There are little nibs all over the outside that do help with gripping though. Cleaning them is easy enough; just wash them in the sink.Although they're called BBQ gloves, we've used them inside with our grill and to remove hot soup bowls from the microwave. My hubby did say he noticed heat in his thumb while using them to remove a hot soup bowl.Where I'm finding these to really shine is opening jars.

"The first thing I noticed about this headset is how large the earpieces are. They really do stick out of the ears quite a ways also. A short flat charging cable was provided; I charged it via my laptop and it only took a few minutes so it was already mostly charged. Also provided is a couple different sizes of earbuds and 2 extra earhooks, plus a clip to make the earphone cable shorter if you need to. The cord is flat so doesn't get tangled. The earhooks help the earphones stay in the ears better, which to me is really nice because I have one ear that is hard to fit. It paired with my Samsung Galaxy S3 easily.The sound is awesome; I've been listening to Amazon Prime Music. The separation of sound is great and I can definitely hear the highs and lows; I'd give the sound quality 5 stars. Something I don't like is whenever I receive a text or email the notification in the headphones is louder than the music I'm listening to.

"Last year a gal in my knitting/crochet group was extolling the virtues of coconut oil, so since then I have been taking coconut oil supplements. So when I was contacted by Island Fresh Coconut Oil for my honest review I took them up on it. I hadn't realized what a large jar 54oz. is! When I first opened the jar and took a sniff I had to take another; it smells so good, exactly like coconut.The jar states this on the label:  ""Store in a cool, dry place protected from heat and light. Refrigeration not required."" Since our house is not cool or protected from heat here in the desert, I decided to refrigerate it. After all it said ""Refrigeration not required""; not ""Do Not Refrigerate"". When I took out the jar a few days later to use the oil in a brownie recipe the whole container of oil had solidified; oops! I couldn't even get a spoon in it. So, I left it out and put it in the pantry hoping it would stay cool enough in there and the next day it had liquified again. So, in the pantry it will stay; it tends to leak somehow so I put the container in a plastic bag. I think the label should read not to refrigerate it.I have used this a couple times in my bread machine recipe and the only difference we could tell is that the crust was a little harder; my hubby said he liked it though because it kinda tasted like French bread. I have put some of this in a container to use in the bathroom to apply to my face and my face looked more radiant. I have put a small amount on my hair after shampooing, but my hair looked greasy. I also have used it as a massage oil on my neck and it works very well.

"I have a neck injury that at times causes debilitating headaches so when I was offered this massager for my honest review I planned on using it on my neck muscles. I'm often massaging the knots in my neck muscles but my fingers don't have a lot of strength.This needed to be assembled first, but it was a simple matter of screwing the parts into each other and screwing the two balls in one of four holes on either side of the bendable middle section (the balls can easily be removing and screwed into different holes). The balls are soft with a hard inside. It also came with a long rope to fasten on one end of the massager.So far I have used it on my neck muscles a few times and that ball really ""hits the spot"". I can position the ball or balls so they're right on a knot in my muscle and then squeeze the ends together so the ball really pushes down on the knot to try and relax it.

"I haven't used any teeth whitening strips for years, so when I was contacted by this company to try their product for my honest review I went for it. I brush my teeth with hydrogen peroxide daily, which is the main ingredient in teeth whitening strips, so I thought my teeth were pretty white already. But I notice one tooth in front that's darker than the others, so I was hoping these strips would lighten it up.I procrastinated for a few days 'cuz I never like putting these things on; seems whenever I apply whitening strips I want to swallow all the time. They were easy to apply and I didn't end up swallowing too much of the gel. After keeping these on for half an hour my teeth ended up being sensitive the rest of the evening. I looked at my teeth after the first time and thought they actually looked a little whiter, but I figured that was a figment of my imagination. The second day I tried them I had very little sensitivity afterward and still thought my teeth looked a little whiter; hmmm. By the third day I put the strips on I *almost* forgot I was wearing them, and there has been no sensitivity afterward since.In less than a week I could tell that my one darker tooth in the front had actually lightened up and the other teeth also seem a little whiter. I'm really amazed that these strips did make a difference. I would definitely recommend these; they do work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSSPITRAUOUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJD5HO2#wasThisHelpful","R3KSSPITRAUOUO","A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F9CMU8KNAY1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And finally, she had hoped to be named head coach for her college football team and that had not happened either. Would anything go right?Seth Walker was not going to mess things up like his parents did. If he made a commitment...he would follow through. He committed to buying the old bank building and opening a restaurant and then proposing to his girlfriend. What he didn't expect to happen was to run into his old nemesis from college and become friends. Good friends.I wanted to read this prequel before reading the next book, From the Start, and I'm glad I did. It gives the reader an idea of what Maple Valley, Iowa and the Walker family is like. This was a novella but packed full of story. The romance, choices, and how sometimes we can make a commitment and even when we reach that point of knowing it might not be best...feel to tied to it to give it up. Looking forward to more of the Walker's stories. (Ava is sister to Autumn from the book, Here to Stay.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9BG3OKG3UYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7SV5O0#wasThisHelpful","R1H9BG3OKG3UYJ","A141H51I3H4B1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141H51I3H4B1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"15 Shades of Pink! by Lisa ScottThree books - Fifteen Stories from the Flirts! CollectionFlirts!The Flirt stories are short, full stories. Great for that in between reading where you want a sweet romance story but don’t have a lot time. Each story has a connection to the other stories, even if it's just a name or place. Some contain mild language.The Hot Girl's Friend: Jane Jameson feels like plain Jane next to her tall, blonde, bombshell friend, Miranda. So why bother trying to get a guys attention when they go out, instead she sends the guys away with unique stories about her friend when they go to the hotties friend to get close to her.She just can’t believe that Brady, the bartender at McGinty’s Bar, is really is not interested in her friend. And challenges her to spend time with him without Miranda to prove she is just as pretty and desirable.Wrong Place Right Guy: Kristen Gold is rescued from an attacker by Tony Malone. He may look like a bad boy himself but something about him makes her feel safe. After a life changing week-end with her rescuer….he leaves her saying their worlds are too different.

Too bad he’s not her type.Never Been Dumped: Rachel Miller has done her share of dumping and she hates it. Deciding not to date she turns down every guy who hits on her. And then she meets Drake Johnson. He will be leaving town in two months and promises to dump her. Having him as a boyfriend works perfect. No one else will bug her and she knows he’ll end it and leave town. They just didn’t plan on getting on so well together.Beach Flirts!Once again the author writes five fun filled romantic stories. This book tells of romances while vacationing by the beach. I enjoy the way the author weaves occurrences from the previous story into the next one, usually something unique. **Some contain mild languageEx on the Beach: Heather Parker was on a beach vacation with her family. Single. This should have been her first anniversary as Mrs. Nick Hicks. What could be worse than to be surrounded by your happily married siblings and their children? Having your ex show up on the same beach, that's what!She's Hot Now: Natalie feels like a new woman...on the outside anyway. Inside she's still the same person who hid from the world. On a beach vacation with a couple of co-workers things change. As one encourages her to move forward and be a new woman, the other one seems to only remind of her of the past.Girls Just Wanna Have Finn: Anna and her three good friends head out for a beach vacation. Sitting on the beach watching the guys walk by. Then her friends spotted Finn Donahue, a womanizer type of guy. The very kind of guy that Anna wanted nothing to do with.

She always enjoyed her summers at the Cape and at Scoopy's. With business slowing down with competition in town, she decides to help revive the diner. And the hottie in town may just help revive her life along the way.Fairy Tale Flirts!I enjoy the way the author weaves her characters together in these stories. A character from one story will be mentioned in passing in a different one or be at the same place. All interwoven slightly into the stories in some small way.Cindi: Cindi Midas life was much different when her parents were alive. She went from having a doting father to being stuck with a hateful stepmother and stepsisters. Cleaning their apartment at Grimm Towers for room and board. She needed a life change.

The mysterious prince stayed hidden because of an accident. Could Belle prove to the elusive prince that life was worth living more than worrying about what people would think of you?Snow: Shawna White wanted to use her singing and dancing talents, like her mother had done as a ballerina. Her widowed stepmother was after husband number three and talked Shaw into being a nanny of her newest husband target Jeremy James, father of seven. Hi ho, hi ho, off to work she did go.Goldi: Goldie Lockston is a bit of a vagabond. She has a home with her parents but would rather not stay there. When she helps a friend with a dog sitting job she decides to stay at the apartment. It's not like Blake Behr, the owner, will know and she's really doing him a favor with round the clock dog sitting, right?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34DFQJQ9WVZOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00889O4P2#wasThisHelpful","R34DFQJQ9WVZOL","A141H51I3H4B1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141H51I3H4B1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Bundle of Flirts! by Lisa ScottThree books - Fifteen StoriesHoliday Flirts!I really enjoy the Flirt! stories. They are fairly short and quick reads and I enjoy the way the author integrates the characters from one story into another. At times it's something little like one character just popping in on the story and other times it's the friend or relatives story. And there are usually little quirks that add the humor.Spooked by Love: For Marnie James the scariest thing this Halloween for her is considering dating again. When she meets Jeff Williams at a Halloween party her daughter went to, she has to decide if she's willing to date again. Is there a ghost of a chance or will she be too spooked to try?Holiday Rush: Lindy Richards loved her fancy clothes and the chic shop she managed. She also loved Christmas. One night a ripped pair of tights changed her life.Alexander Whitney was managing one of the Save Land stores for his dad. Bidding his time before he could move on to a different city. When there was an emergency involving his store parking lot life got a lot more interesting.Missing Christmas: Ginny McDonald had told her family she'd be moving from New York to Florida in the first story, Spooked By Love. She was in love with Ryan and his job had him moving. Now it's a few days before Christmas and she's homesick. She misses her family, decorating and snow. And Florida's sunshine didn't have anything Christmas about it. She wanted to go home and there was nothing that Ryan could say or do to changer her mind. Or was there?Living in Arizona I could fully relate to this story. Away from family and looking at a cactus with lights and Santa hats is far from a Midwest ChristmasTingle All the Way: Jessica Richards didn't have the memory of any great Christmas or her sister Lindy's excitement over the holiday. When she called the police on a would be robber, she just ended up ruining a little girls Christmas. Every thing she tried to make it up to Morgan just ended up in a bigger mess.Charlie Grant was watching his niece and wanted to give her the best Christmas ever. The nosy neighbor ruined that idea. The more the woman tried to make things right...the more he was intrigued with her. Maybe he would have the best Christmas ever.Giving Up Guys: Three of Ginny's friends were out celebrating New Years Eve when they decided they would give up guys for a month. Ginny and Ryan seemed happy in Florida, but Lori, Claire and Harper seemed to be finding only duds when it came to men.Lori takes an upholstery class and her resolve for no guys is on shaky ground when the Tom Murphy, the instructor, turns out to be an uber-hottie.Harper Reese figures she's safe from men when she takes a belly dancing class. Figures that handsome Patrick Dunn is a student too.Claire Pennington signs up for scuba diving classes, forgetting how she's not fond of swimming. After class she finds a friend in bartender Nate Johnson.As always Lisa Scott finds a unique way to end the book with a glimpse at the previous couples who met in the other four stories.Wedding Flirts!Lisa Scott's Flirt! books are full of humor and romance. The fifth story always brings everyone from the first four stories together for a finale, and now and then they even pop in from previous books. Which I personally enjoy when you get to see the people you met come back for a special appearance. Great stories that are also short enough to read when you aren't in the mood for a long novel. They are connected by characters, but standalone so that you can read one and come back for more later.My Fake Fiance: When Samantha Cooper gets a wedding invitation from her arch frenemy from school she decides she needs to find a way to go with her head held high. So she hires a fake fiance with a fake accent and fake job. Justin Banks was only acting for the money but he found himself wishing he was the kind of guy Sam would really want, because she could sure be the right girl for him.Bridesmaid Blues: Micki Keegan was invited to be in so many weddings that she started blogging about it. Of course that just got her invited to be in even more. She wasn't at all blue about being a bridesmaid, no plans to marry, ever. It wasn't in her family genes to have good marriages. And then she met Ben, not the one night stand type. All or nothing.The One That Got Away: Miranda, who was first introduced in Flirts! The Hot Girls Friend, just wanted to find a rich Australian to marry. And she found one. Running into someone from her past at a wedding made her realize she had unfinished business. Kevin had never known why Miranda had left him without any explanation. And now they meet when they are both engaged and about to get married...to other people.Wedding Auditions: Kelly Warner has no desire to be in a bridezilla wedding. Since the nutty woman was marrying her best friend Bryce, she had no choice but to audition. Yup, the woman had three dozen men and women trying out to be in her wedding. At least bridezilla had a handsome step-brother. Liam Streeter was the one bright spot of all the craziness.Do Over: Moira Moore was the most wanted photographer around, especially weddings. She wondered if she'd always be on this side of the camera looking in when it came to love. Then came the wedding where one of the groomsman brought back every humiliating moment she had felt one day at school. A humiliation that had hung on for ten long years. Craig Fitzpatrick.More Flirts!These five stories follow the romances of the Carter family. Three brothers and two sisters who had a surprise when their mother passed away, she had money they didn't know about and each of them became millionaires. The problem with that was they never knew if the guys or gals they dated really cared for them or if they were just after the Carter money.Pickup Lessons: Stone Kinney is an absolutely adorable character. He is so smart in academics, but clueless with women. After reading books on dating he stakes out the perfume counter at the mall and uses cheesy pick-up lines. At the end of the day the gal working the counter, Kyla Carter, offers to give him lessons on picking up women. As it was obvious his books had failed him.Ex Therapy: Aubrey Carter, sister to Kyla from Pickup Lessons, needs to find out why her relationships never last. Realizing only six guys in her past made it past a few dates she targeted them. Writing up a survey she began contacting them. They didn't seem to be that excited to see her, but she pressed on. What better way to find out how to make her relationships last longer, then by finding out why they failed?Mr. Wrong: Lisa Scott has outdone herself in this hilarious story. Diana Hart, Aubrey's therapist from Ex Therapy, needs to write a second book. She's decided to write on finding Mr. Wrong. She dresses much different from her usual conservative clothes and hits the bars instead of meeting men at charity balls or her usual outings. She keeps running into Toby Carter, Kyla and Aubrey's brother, but he's too much like her usual type. One blind date outing is enough to give her a lifetime of nightmares.I Know Who You Kissed Last Night: Lisa Scott has outdone herself in this hilarious story.

It was hard to get motivated and the list seemed impossible. Then one day she saw a missed connection on Craigslist and contacted the author of it, Nick Carter. He was looking for a girl in a pink hat that had been on the train. She was the wrong girl, but for some reason he wanted to help her with her list. To live some of his life through helping her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8V8TVEDYL88X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEEXPI6#wasThisHelpful","R8V8TVEDYL88X","A141H51I3H4B1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141H51I3H4B1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cooler was alot bigger than I had thought it would be.  I like the top velcro flap that lets you get inside the cooler without opening the whole top.  You can put in over a case of pop in this cooler and still have room left.  You are not to use ice in this cooler but you can use the ice packs which work just as good.  There is a pocket in the front and two mesh pockets on the side.  You can zip from both sides and there is also a nice handle to carry with.  The bag is made out of great quality material and will last a long time.  You could put a whole families lunch in here and go off to the park or beach and still have room left over.  It measures 13x13x8.  You could fit two 2 liters in it too if you wanted too.  I received this item for a discount for my honest unbiased review.

"My mother in law has a Galaxy S3 so we thought this would be a good fit for her.  She usually just uses a rubber cover so this was a big change for her.  We put her phone in it and that was easy but when trying to slide it out of the belt clip it was super hard to get out.  After playing with it for a while we got it to slide up and down ok.  This is just too hard for her to work and that is why I am giving a four star.The product is well made and will really keep a phone protected for someone.  There is also a clip on the back to hold on your pants.  There is also a piece on the actual phone case to hold the phone up instead of having to prop it up when watching a video like my son does.  There is also a piece of soft material in between the phone case and the belt clip to keep the front of the phone protected.  I received this item for a discount for my honest unbiased review.

"I have never used Pant Hangers that are open ended before.  I usually use the ones like at the store with the clips on the end or just hang the over middle of regular plastic hangers.  These are super super nice made out of metal with a plastic over the part where you put your pants over.  My kids have lots of pants or athletic pants and they are always falling off of the regular hangers but the plastic that is on these hangers it holds the pants in place, actually harder to move the pants than I thought would be possible so they are not going to fall off.  I am not going to keep rewashing clean clothes because they wont fall on the floor off of the hangers.  I will be buying more hangers like this but really like that they come in packs of 20 so I only need one more!  I received this item for a discount for my honest unbiased review.

"The Sound Intone MS 200 Headset is really nice.  I hooked it up to my phone and at first I didnt think they worked but I pushed the tip in until it almost made a snapping noise and then they started working with no problem.  This pair will fold into itself for easy storage or carrying.  The ear pieces are padded and covered with a leather material that is soft against your ears.  I would suggest more padded at the top but I am also more used to earbuds so that may be the difference.  I like that the cord is nylon as it will last a lot longer.  My daughter will be getting this pair as she loves to listen to music and then maybe I wont have to hear it.  I think these are perfect for anyone to use.

"I am really impressed with this set of headphones for the cost.  This set is the Sound Intone HD200.  The fold into themselves for easy storage.  The arms of the headphones also adjust and are made out of metal.  They just pull out and when you put them on your head you can adjust them and they stay in place.  They click at very small intervals.  I turned on pandora and was super impressed with the base and clarity of the sound.  The ears are padded with a leather type material that is super soft and it is also padded.  I didnt have any problems with the ear pieces after I got it adjusted on my head.  The cord is long enough that I can work on my computer and have my phone sitting on the table next to me and still be fine.  They also dont weigh much so putting them in your back pack or computer bag folded up wont add much additional weight.  I would suggest to the makers to put some padding at the top as there is not much but otherwise love them!  I received this item for a discount for my honest unbiased review.

"I love liquid Chalk pens and these dont disappoint.  The colors are bright and they come out without leaving streaks.  The Gideon Premium Art Quality Liquid Chalk Pens can be used on chalkboard labels, chalkboards, windows, LED Boards, and so much more.  My daughter has an LED board that lights up and she goes through alot of these type of pens.  You just shake and push down on the tip of the pen (I used a cardboard box) and let up a little and do it again and you will see it coming down to the tip.  Then you will be ready to use them.  Just making sure the tip is completely covered will help make sure there are no streaks when you use them.  I love all of the different colors that you normally dont get.  I love letting my 16 year old daughter write all over our huge front windows or the sliding back windows for each holiday.  She loves drawing and does a great job with these.

"We never have sharpened pencils when the kids need them to do homework and with teenagers you know they are not bringing them home from school.  This electronic pencil sharpener is super easy to use.  You put in four AA batteries (does not come with them) and you are ready to sharpen.  I pushed down on the pencil and after about 10 seconds my pencil was sharpened.  This pencil even had a coating on it that is a plastic type to have it all pretty and it still did a good job.  It is small in size and will be easy to set right on my desk and it also has four pads on the bottom to keep from scratching my desk.

"The Sound Intone HD30 Headset is so nice.  They are also comfortable and they arms go up to fit your head. I got this set in purple and love the color too.  They have a padding on the ear part that is made of a softer leather and also a little bit of padding at the top of the head.  They are also made out of a thicker plastic so they wont break as easy as some I have seen.  The cord also detaches which I think is so smart because that is usually what breaks and then the whole headset is no good but not with these.

"I have been using the super smoothing cream for a week now and really like how it is making my face feel.  A very small amount, like a dab, goes a long way with this product which is good because it is a very small container of 1 ounce.  It spreads very well and it doesnt feel oily on your face.  The cream has no smell.  All skin types can use this product to moisturize and hydrate.  I use it in the morning right after a shower and then again at night after I take off all of my makeup.

He was excited to see them when I got them as he uses them for so many things including tying down mattresses, furniture, boxes, tvs, etc.  These are really great quality and the ratchets are really nice too.  They are very sturdy and the piece that you push down is covered in a hard plastic.  The hooks are covered in a softer but hard plastic rubber which is great so it doesnt scratch your truck.

"I was surprised that this one was smaller than many I have seen which is ok with me.  There are three different speeds for both the clitoris animal and the penis itself.  It is rather noisy as most are and there are bright lights.  There are balls circling around in the penis and the animal is scary looking but it doesnt hurt.  It all fits and works in just the right way. This toy is made with good quality in comparison of the different ones that I have used.  The animal for the clitoris may break after a while but if you take care of it and dont get crazy it will work for a long time.  The antennas are at the right place and the vibration is perfect for what you need it for.  If you need a little more then put a little pressure on the back of the head and you will get more.

"These IncrediSonic VUE Series VR Glasses are neat in concept and so much better than the previous ones we have had that are made out of cardboard.  I put the batteries in the remote that came with the package and connected it to my phone by bluetooth.  It was super easy to do but the instructions told you what to look for and on my phone it came up with a bunch of numbers instead.  I really like the straps that hold it on your head and that it is padded for your face.  This provides blocking all of the light from getting in and messing up with the pictures.  The bands on the head piece are also adjustable so there is not so much weight in the front.  All in all way better than the previous pair I had that were cardboard.  I thought those were good until I tried these.  The remote is really nice as otherwise you would have to take the phone out of them to change things.  You can download simulators with 3d too.I gave these a 4 star because the instructions that come with the package are not good at all for what I needed.

"I am so impressed with the Ivation 1800 Watt Protable Induction Countertop Cooktop Burner.  When I first took this out of the box I was completely confused so if I was to say anything at all negative about this is that there should be better instructions as I almost burned green beans while I was standing there trying to figure it out.You plug the burner in and you will hear a beep, click on the the power, and then you can click between numbers 1 to 6 or temperatures.  I am still not positive exactly what I should be cooking on but with green beans covered in cheese I turned the temperature all the way down and then the number all the way down and that worked great.  When my mom was messing with it trying to turn it up a bit it really started boiling but she turned the numbers up and then the temperature went up too.  It gets really hot really fast but works great.Now before you start using it you need to make sure you are using the right pans so you dont mess the whole thing up.  I took my TFal pans and made sure they were magnetic (you will see in pictures) to see if they were the right ones to use and they are.  I was happy otherwise you can also use a few other kinds of pans but NOT all pans will work.  If you take a magnet and it sticks then those will work for sure.  My niece didnt do that on her stove top and it completely cracked in half so be careful.I am really excited to take this out on the road with my husband in his semi to finally be able to cook some meals and not always eating out.

My niece is super excited to use it to on Halloween and she was the main reason I got it as she is the talented artist.

The on and off button is even marked with a sticker that you can take off.  I love that this is not only wireless but waterproof and shockproof!  We have not tried the shockproof but taking their word for it right now.  We are going to take it to Cabo with us at the end of the month and it will probably get a workout then.  We are excited to be able to have music by the pool.  I plugged in to charge it before I went to bed and got up and started using it.  You can use the plus button to fast forward the music or turn up the music if you hold it in and the minus button does the opposite.  Super impressive!

" 2:01 Mins This portable LED projector works really well. I was really surprised  at how clear the image quality was, I used it to watch TV on the wall in my dining room and it was perfect.

"This Bluetooth selfie stick works really well. Its nice and compact, measuring roughly 7.5 inches when folded up, and extending to roughly 32.5 inches in length. The telescopic pole seems to be made of a nice thick quality material and doesn't appear it will bend or break easily. It was very easy to pair to my IPhone 6, I simply held the camera shutter button and it started blinking a blue light. I turned the Bluetooth on my IPhone 6 and it immediately found Bluebits, I selected it and it was connected. Once connected the camera shutter button light glows a sold blue color.The mount is a ""C"" style clamp which is great for any size cell phone from an IPhone 4 all the way up to an IPhone 6s Plus. It holds my phone secure and I don't have to worry about it slipping or coming out of the clamp. Now I cant speak for android phones as I only have IPhone in my home, however I'm sure the process is the same as far as pairing and connecting, however there are some androids that are huge and I would say this selfie stick wont fit some of those mega phones. This selfie stick also comes with a micro USB for charging and a wrist strap you can attach to the bottom of the stick. As far as how well it operates, it does it job. The shutter button snaps the photo instantly and there is no delay between the time I press it and the photo appearing on my phone.

"This 3000 mAh iPhone 6 battery case is really nice. It is very lightweight and sleek compared to other battery cases I've used in the past. Its 2 pieces, a long bottom piece and a small top piece. The case doesn't come apart when you slide it in and out of your pocket which was also an issue I had with other battery cases.

The case charges the phone as well as the case, the phone charges first and then once that's at 100% it continues to charge the case until that is at 100%.

"This stainless steel tumbler is really nice. It holds 16 ounces of liquid and the design is slender so it will fit in any cup holder. It has a twist off top with large opening that makes this tumbler easy to fill. There is a press button flip top that opens and allows you to drink for the top easily. My only complaint is that the button placement to open the flip top is right where you drink, therefore it gets in the way. At least it does for me. I would have liked to have seen the press button release of set to one side so it didn't obstruct the drinking spout. Not a huge issue but a noticeable annoyance for me. I do like how there is a slide lock that prevents accidentally pressing the flip top release and the overall design is nice. Its dishwasher safe and easy to clean. Overall very nice quality product.

"This leather travel document holder is much larger than I had expected it to be. It measures 9.1 inches by 4.7 inches and the leather is really nice. This document hold has slots for up to 16 items so its large enough to take anything and everything you need. The quality and design of this product is really nice, It should hold up very well over time.

"This pre-workout supplement seems to be working really well. I purchased these for my husband and he stated they help with energy during his workout and recovery after his workout. His only complaint was the dosing. He's 5'10 and 190 lbs, the dosing says he should take between 4 and 5 capsules. That seems like a lot. He's not a pill taker so taking one or 2 is more than he prefers, however to get the desired effect, he has to take 4-5 of these. Other than that he likes them.

"These stainless steel salt and pepper grinders are really nice. They each hold 6oz and are made of a nice thick glass with stainless steel top.

"This removable growth chart does what its designed to do. I really like the concept and the fact that you can take it down and move it from house to house. Its pretty basic though, there isn't anything fancy about this growth chart. Its 3 inches wide by 6 feet tall. It measures up to 7 feet because when you mount it, you start at 12 inches off the ground. We recently purchased a new home and in our old home, we had a door that had permanent marker marks with dates and names showing how tall my daughter was at different points in her life. I was able to transfer those measurements onto this growth chart and take it with me to the new house. It was a great way to be able to take those memories with me.

"This IPhone 4s case is really nice. I have a 7 year old daughter who has an older iPhone and I was having a hard time finding these older IPhone cases. Most cases out now are for the newer model phones. She absolutely loves this case. It comes in 2 pieces, the gray rubber piece and the pink plastic piece. The gray rubber piece covers the volume buttons and power button, but they are easy to press and adjust through the rubber. The headset jack, silent switch and charging ports are all open so you have easy access.The charging port fits after market chargers that are usually thicker than the OEM chargers which is nice, because sometimes you have to remove the case to get the phone to charge if the charger is too thick. I haven't had that issue with this case which is great. Overall I am very pleased with this case. It provides good protection and looks great.

"This Spontuneous family board game is actually pretty fun. We originally bought this game to play on family game night, however we've started playing in with friends when our kids weren't around. Either way the game was fun for all ages and everyone ends up laughing and having a good time. I have a 7 year old and she is constantly asking if we can play. This game now trumps all other board games when it comes to family game night. Overall if you are looking for a fun game for all ages, this one is a good one.

She is currently doing watercolor and eventually wants to branch out to Oil painting. She's a beginner but this set has everything she needs.

"This shredded memory foam body pillow is amazing! I have several shredded memory foam pillows that I love. So when I saw they made a shredded memory foam ""body"" pillow, I knew I had to have it. This pillow arrived packaged very tightly, it was roughly half the size of a standard pillow until I unwrapped it. Once I unwrapped it, the pillow started to grow, and grow and grow. After about 10 minutes the pillow was fully fluffed and perfect. Shredded memory foam pillows have some nice weight to them, its not a lightweight cheap pillow. You can feel the quality in the weight of this pillow.This pillow also has a nice bamboo cover that is very soft, and its removable so you can wash it which is great. Since purchasing this pillow I don't toss and turn like I used too, I sleep much better and I know its because of this pillow.

"This manual trash compactor works pretty well. I like the concept and the design but I think the metal needs to be heavier and stronger. This compactor works well for lightweight items such as grass or leaves (we used it for leaves last weekend). As far as using it for heavy trash I think it would bend. However it worked great for compacting leaves. I used to have to press the leaves down by hand and I would be covered in dirt by the time we were done, but not anymore. If you use this product for softer bulky items it will serve its purpose and do a good job. If you expect to use it for heavy trash items you might be disappointed.

We live on the last street built and there is a huge empty field that backs up to our home that has yet to be developed. I hate mice, nothing makes my skin crawl more. So I figured I would rather be safe than sorry. I plugged this into an outlet in my garage and its been going for about a week now. I have noticed a decrease in spiders, which is nice, and so far I haven't seen any mice, but I cant honestly say that's because of this device as of yet. I will come back and update my review in a couple of months to let you know how effective this device is.

"This extended range wireless cooking thermometer is really cool. I honestly couldn't find anything negative about this product. To start this product comes with a receiver, a transmitter, 2 detachable stainless steel probes, 2 probe clips and a wire stand. This thermometer takes 4 AA batteries and the batteries are not included.The receiver is set up in 3 sections within the window. The top section is where you set the mode between BBQ and Food, and meat and taste. The middle section is the read out for probe 1 and the bottom section is read out for probe 2. There are 8 buttons below the window that operate the power, light, Celsius/Fahrenheit, Set, Taste, meat, high and low. This thermometer has 15 pre-programmed meat settings, including some not so common meats such as rabbit, buffalo, boar, duck, deer, moose and elk.The transmitter has a small window on the front that shows the temperature, there are 2 buttons on the back, one for Celcius/Fahrenheit and one for the power. You can take the receiver up to 300 feet from the transmitter without losing signal and the probes are heat resistant up to 716 degrees. If you do lose signal the receiver will start to beep every 4 seconds and you have to press the sync button on the back to resync.This thermometer has so many great features and the accuracy is on point. My husband grilled some T-bone steaks the other night and usually over cooks them, I like mine medium well and usually it comes out well. Not that night, my steak came out perfect. He was able to come inside while the steaks were cooking and prepare side items, but always knew what temp the steaks were at. Overall I really like this thermometer.

" 4:01 Mins This Ivation electric pressure washer is really nice. It  comes with everything you need, 5 different spray attachments, a wand and a turbo wand. The spray nozzle attachments come in 0 degree, 15 degree, 25 degree and 40 degree. You also get a soap nozzle as well. To use this pressure washer just hook it up to your hose with the provided copper attachment, plug it into a power source, and power it on. This power washer is completely silent unless you are squeezing the handle and its spraying. Once you release the handle the noise also stops which is really nice. This pressure washer is perfect for washing your car or clearing your driveway of red mud like we did in this video.We used to have a craftsman electric pressure washer similar to this one and this one honestly works better than that one. The craftsman one we had was loud even when you weren't spraying, the noise was constant, unlike this one that stops when you release.

There are 5 buttons on one of the ears. The power button which is in the center and volume up, volume down, skip track and reverse track. These headphones were very easy to pair to my IPhone 6- Just held the button until it flashed blue and red and then my IPhone picked it up right away. The bass, mids and highs sound really nice for a brand I have never heard of.

"This Ivation window vacuum cleaning kit works really well. Where has this device been all my life? This window vacuum is perfect for glass shower doors because it vacuums up the excess liquid and leaves a streak free finish. You can use it for all types of windows but I use mine mainly on the glass shower door. I hate when the water dries up and leaves hard water drops all over the door. With this device I can suck up the excess water when I get out of the shower and my door looks beautiful. It literally takes seconds. I keep it under my bathroom sink, charge it about once every 2 weeks and it hasn't let me down yet. The rechargeable battery lasts quite a while, I use this device daily for about 30 seconds to a minute and the battery lasts roughly 2 weeks. It comes with a sprayer attachment you can fill with cleaning product and all sorts of great attachments.My 7 year old daughter has also started using this vacuum to clean the glass storm door that is in front of our front door. She uses the sprayer container to give her extra reach so that she can get to the top of the door. Usually I cant get her to help me with chores but she loves using this vacuum, it makes doing chores fun for her so that's a plus. Overall if you have a clear shower door and hate the water spot build up like I do, or a child who only helps clean when they have a fun cleaning tool, than I would definitely recommend this product. You wont be disappointed.

"I couldn't be happier with this purchase. These panties are perfect for my 2 year old daughter. I purchased them in a 2T and they fit perfectly. No saggy butt, no bulky excess material. They are snug fit so they fit like panties should fit. I hate children's panties that come in 2T/3T, there is a huge difference between 2T and 3T. I love that these come in specific sizes.

"I absolutely love the quality of these tagless panties. I have a 2 year old daughter and started wearing big girl panties about a month ago. I purchased some from the local chain store in my area and they only came in a 2T/3T. Well my daughter is small. So those panties were huge. Then I came across these panties. They came in a 2T and were labeled as snug fit. I purchased them and as soon as they arrived I put them on my 2 year old daughter. They fit perfectly! No more big saggy butt. The quality of these panties exceeded my expectations. Not only do they look cute on my 2 year old but they are soft. She is so excited about her new panties and I am very pleased with this purchase.

" 2:19 Mins My 7 year old daughter loves this LED writing board. It measures 16x12 and has hanging hooks both vertically and horizontally.  This board comes with an 8 pack of chalk markers, a cleansing cloth, and a remote control. The remote control 15 color options, a white, flash, strobe, fade and smooth button. There is also a brightness up and brightness down button too. We found that to change the color you have to point the remote at the sensor on the cord verses pointing the remote at the board itself. The board erases easily and overall has a lot of cool functions. This would be perfect for a restaurant or bar, but we decided we are going to hang it in my daughters room. Great LED light board.

"This shotgun bore cleaner works really well. I used it today on my 12 gauge shotgun and it worked like a charm. There is a weighted piece on the end of the black cord that you drop into the bore and it comes out the other end. Then you pull and it cleans out all the residue left in the bore. One section of the white part has metal scrubbers on it which is nice and its machine washable so it can be washed and reused.

"Okay, it's a complete kit, you get the trimmer handle which comes with the beard cutter mounted on it. A slim trimming head for shaping and getting into small spaces and there's also a 'stubble' head I assume is for that scruffy look. Along with the three cutters comes a somewhat wimpy cleaning brush, a small tube of mineral oil to lubricate the blades with and a length comb that adjusts longer and shorter via a dial you spin on the trimmer body. Everything comes packed in a huge plastic case that has a military finish and feel to it. According to the product description; 'Each piece of the kit stores securely in the durable plastic storage case.' but they really don't. There's non place to lock down or 'secure' any of the parts at all. The inside of the case holds a fitted cardboard box with two sides that you can put the different bits but, again, there's nothing secure about how the parts are stored and I have doubts that the cardboard is going to last long in a damp bathroom environment.That being said the trimmers, once lubricated, do a great job of giving you a close trim. I hate to blade shave and have used trimmers for decades. Once I ensured the adjustable comb was solidly in place (my first attempt, not so well) the trimmer mows through long beard hair like crazy. Granted my goatee is a bit shorter than I intended I chalk it up to a learning experience. I got things in place and set right and it did a great getting my cheeks smooth and my goatee (albeit a bit shorter than expected) trimmed evenly. It was even quieter than most other trimmers I've used over the years. The case is a bit of a disappointment and the adjustable comb is thin and brittle feeling but it feels good in my hand and does it's job well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1R90CO8T2OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W2RFVW#wasThisHelpful","R1R1R90CO8T2OV","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept is fairly sound and for skinny folk it's probably pretty comfortable. You wear the strap over you shoulder instead of across or around your neck. This rigs like a messenger bag with the camera being across your body. A smaller strap rides under the armpit on the side you have the shoulder pad on to keep things in place. I'm a big guy and found this secondary strap, that isn't designed to be removed, to bite into my body and cause some discomfort even after wearing it for a short time. The camera mounts to a single butterfly-like threaded nut that threads into the camera's tripod mount. There's a quick release at one end of the shoulder strap that releases VERY easily. I was just shrugging things into place to get a feel for the rig when I bumped both sides of the release and luckily caught my camera a foot from the floor.I tried this with three cameras. All three have threaded onto my tripod numerous times. The threads for this strap are rather shallow and poorly machined. One not cheap camera with metal threading refuse to take more than half a turn of the threading. I wasn't about to trust my camera to that little hold.. The next camera, also not inexpensive and also with metal tripod threading took the mount but it had to have some force behind it to get it to thread in. The third camera, far less expensive, with plastic tripod threads, easily mounted to the nut.I also needed a pair of pliers to open the threaded nut on the carabiner ever time I wanted to open it. The threads would just get crossed up and jam and I'd need the pliers to get it to turn.While the concept is there and if you're skinny it might be comfortable there's some serious quality control issues. It's just not great. If I had to choose between this and the giveaway straps manufacturers throw in the box I'd take the NEOpine hands down but there are just far better camera straps out there for a similar price. Some quality control checks and a bit better machining of threaded parts and this could be a contender but as it stands I wouldn't recommend this.I received this item in exchange for my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHO0J8NNSQIC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012IB9KCM#wasThisHelpful","RHO0J8NNSQIC9","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a review of the black set of headphones. The blue accent lighting is very cool. I understand why there's an on/off switch for the lighting. It could become somewhat distracting at a LAN party (do they still have those?) but I have no intention of ever turning the lights off when I'm using these headphones even if I can't see the light while I'm wearing them.Speaking of wearing them they're quite comfortable. The extendable headband will expand to fit any size head. I think you could wear these over a helmet they expand so much. The volume dial I found a little hard to control but that's just because I have some nerve damage in my hands.The headphones have a 'hidden' microphone which is quite easy to extract and retract and put back. I have yet to use this option as I just don't chat while gaming. The headphones also purport to have a vibration function but I also have no ability to test that function.Sound quality is pretty good  it says there's an integrated subwoofer but the description only lists two 40mm drivers and I'm not about to take these apart to find out what's going on inside. As mentioned the sound is good, not quite exceptional but crisp and clear. The bass is boomy and a little muddy but not bad for headphone in this price range.These are not wireless headphones. They connect via a heavy, a gigantically heavy, USB cable. I've seen vacuum cleaners from the 1950's that had thinner cables.

"I wanted to give this at least four stars but there's really enough drawbacks that it honestly deserves three. A solid ""It's Okay"", as Amazon puts a three-star review.What I liked. By the way the unit I received is significantly different in design from the product images provided on Amazon, see my photos once they post. The design is very unique. A semi-opaque case with the single speaker mounted to appear to float on the face of the unit. The electronics and display are enclosed in a box inside the smoke colored case. This extends out of the top of the unit and had the controls mounted on top. A very nice feature is separate next/back track controls and volume up/down buttons. This is missing from SO many Bluetooth speakers. The design is retro. Being old it reminds me of a mod clock radio out of the 60's or 70's. The sound quality is good, tone is okay. The unit also supports micro-SD cards, USB memory sticks, 3.5mm plugs from MP3 players and such and surprisingly an FM radio receiver.What I don't like; the FM radio function makes no sense. I've read the instructions several times and it still confuses me. Still. I ,as able to get clear FM reception from the one station I was able to pull in. The display is also retro. Simple red LED lights that could be bigger. The clock only displays 24hour military time. If there's any way to change to normal time I was unable to find it. The single speaker, as mentioned above, has good tone but NO volume. My antiquated flip-phone is as loud, maybe louder, than this speaker. If you wanted to listen to music at night in bed I guess this would do. It's honestly useless for any party type application. On the box I received it clearly states ""Transparent Alarm Clock Speaker."" It is not an alarm clock. You cannot set an alarm. I really dislike this type of dishonesty.Bluetooth pairing went without a problem but anytime I so much as nudged the speaker the sound would quit for a second. Range was good I was able to have my tablet twenty feet away and the connection was solid.In the end? This looks really neat. Like something I (or your grandparents) would have had in the 70's but volume (yes I fully charged it) wasn't impressive. FM radio function was utterly confusing and what I consider the worst sin, right on the box they say this is an alarm clock and it's not. There's nothing in the instruction about setting an alarm. Heck, I couldn't get it out of military/24hr time. I just wasn't happy or impressed with it.I received this item in exchange for my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTR7SI6BI4MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7AAH42#wasThisHelpful","RPTR7SI6BI4MW","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing puts out an incredible amount of cool steam. Special effects, horror movie, levels of fogging and the steam is as cool as cool could be. I filled the tank perhaps  full and ran it for several hours. There was no problem with the output the entire time it ran. Everything was steady and calm. Several times during the evening I changed the output level between high and then down to the lowest setting available, When I turned it off at bedtime the humidifier had run for hours and still had plenty of water left in the tank. They claim eight to ten hours of continuous operation time and I have no problem believing that, on medium or low, it will easily run that long on a single tank.Cleaning was a breeze. You use no detergent. I've got an old toothbrush set aside for spring when we need to clean the internal parts before storing it for the summer, with the recommended light bleach solution, until next winter rolls around. The forced air heating here in Florida makes the house feel like the middle of an incredibly dry desert.

"This is  a review of the single chain strand purple and chrome heavy-duty stainless bracelet with a seriously well holding fold-over clasp. Although this bracelet more than eight inches the light purple color looks better on a woman's arm than on a man's/ Although if you're mixing more than one of these bracelets the purple goes better as part as a mixture of colors instead of a single light purple, layer. The materials are seriously high quality and this feels like once you latch it on your wrist you won't be removing it until you're passing it along to the next generation.It comes incredibly well packaged in a quilted black box while the bracelet itself is double wrapped in clear which it took me more than ten minutes to get off the bracelet. The gift box was a bit short for the whole bracelet but id did sit nicely in the box once unwrapped from all the plastic it was in. Something I suggest you remove before giving this as a gift to someone.

"One small change and this would be a five-star device. It's opaque enough to cover a fairly large area with even the low setting picked. This would be great for marking a trail-head, an out house or the central area of a campsite for evening meals, clean-up or games. It weighs next to nothing and can be deflated into an easily packable unit or small enough to strap to your pack and hope it pick up some sun and catch a charge.Now we run face first into the 3-star wall review. The ONLY way this charges is via solar power. It takes quite a bit of light, 'lumens', to cause this to charge. It didn't charge just sitting out in the living room. If I put it directly under the 100 watt light bulb the unit goes into charge mode. My regular headlamp can, at just the right angle, get a little charge going. You have to have this outside, in good view of direct sun when it's not cloudy to get this to charge. It would take pennies per unit to put a USB charging plug onto this device. It would add next to no weight and you could recharge it from battery packs, car chargers, home wall chargers, anywhere. It would honestly add next to nothing to the production cost, you don't even have to include a cable, everyone has at least one already sitting around. As it its you HAVE to rely on sun or bright indoor lights to produce a charge. I honestly think this design choice was patently ridiculous. This thing is fun. It inflates. You could lay catch across your campsite and probably do no real damage to it. It could be banged around while hanging in a heavy wind. I managed to get six solid hours on  of a charge with the light set to the lower of the two settings. If you're camping and it's cloudy or storming and you used the light the night before you are out of luck the next light. This is something you just cannot rely upon.But it's that one stupid, single charging source, flaw takes a great area camping light from five star greatness to three star mediocrity.I received this item in exchange for my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MAA8F5GXS7CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IP5WYA#wasThisHelpful","R1MAA8F5GXS7CS","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You'd really need several of these to kick up a party to full blast but a single bulb is a fun addition to a small den or bedroom. When set to white which is more of bluish color than straight white I'd compare it to a 40 watt bulb, maybe a little dimmer. The numerous colors you can select from on the remote don't quite match between the bulb and the remote but there is quite a variety. Along with the static light colors you can also cycle through the lights in several modes; flash, strobe, fade and smooth. Oddly enough flash changes the light colors faster than strobe which I just don't understand. I'd consider 'strobe' to be the faster cycle between colors but that's the designer's choice. Fade and Smooth seem to be about the same thing with just a longer and slower change of the color. To be honest I have black lampshades on my bedrooms lights and the lamp I've put this bulb in I tend to keep the bulb on red and almost, not quite, as dim as it will go in the settings. It's incredibly eerie and great for reading horror stories on my Kindle PaperWhite. I was happily impressed that the rather large white bulb of this unit fit quite well in the smallish harp of my floor lamp. This is fun and for now I'm going to use it to set the mood for reading and sleeping in my bedroom.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LANA0JLXKVAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W50LW2S#wasThisHelpful","R3LANA0JLXKVAJ","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the bright orange speaker. I'm torn between three and four stars for this speaker. It's okay, all the way around pretty much okay. The sound is okay. Less bass than some so you can actually hear the mids and highs. Volume doesn't get crazy loud but it's loud enough for a group sitting at a table or hanging out in a small camp site. It's not going to blast your next kegger. I like the orange color as it will be much easier to find if it's dropped in the dark.The bottom of the speaker is one large old style (non-latching) suction cup that holds to smooth surfaces fairly well. Mine's a bit, maybe a bit more, lopsided so it doesn't sit level but that's no real big deal. Controls are a bit hard to see as they're the same color and in the design of the speaker. Also, like lots of speakers I've run into the volume up and down buttons are also the next/previous track buttons. Function depends on how long you hold down the buttons. Forget and go to raise the volume just a touch and you've changed songs instead of the volume. Separate volume and song buttons would be a nice idea. The carabiner the system comes with is a bit small and hard to attach to the small handle but you could put a larger one on that to hang the speaker from a tree, backpack, fence, etc.It's a good speaker. Nothing stands out as great but I do like the idea of the big suction cup and the sound's nice. In a nutshell this is pleasant to listen to and reasonably easy to use.I received this speaker in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX8B4OGGQFK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVKGX4#wasThisHelpful","RRX8B4OGGQFK7","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly comfortable  headlamp that's reasonably well made. It takes three AAA batteries and produces a decently bright light that has some focus ability and three light modes. Bright, not quite so bright and the ubiquitous flashing feature that every single light manufacturer thinks we need. I've been camping for four decades. I was a scouting leader for more than ten years and I think there was one time a flashing flashlight would have been a useful t draw attention and I accomplished this by using my hand. But the lamp can zoom in and out has to decently bright settings that I wouldn't be afraid to hike easy to moderate trails with in the dark. The straps are comfortably adjustable for most head sizes and will easily fit over a cap or hard-hat. The casing is rubberized for a good grip. All in all it's a decent headlamp that's not that front heavy, stays in place well and comfortably and provides a fairly good amount of light.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KCJWHNSBAGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R22KCJWHNSBAGS","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This this is awesome. For something that easily sits on the palm of your hand the detail is pretty sharp. It honestly looks like a World War ][ Tiger tank with tons of details. I received the standard, mostly green, camouflage there's also a darker camouflage and a blue tank available. Colors appear to ship randomly. Remote control device coloring also seem to match the tank you get.This little thing really zips around. I was surprised at how quick it gets up and goes. There's also a super speed button on the controller that adds fifty percent to the speed of the tank. There's also engine noises and what I'm guessing are 'track' sounds are this races around. The turret will turn 360° in one direction, I found going one way the barrel would hang up on the antenna but the turret rotation switches back and forth as you rotate. The barrel also raises and lowers as the turret turns. When you press the fire button there's the sound of a cannon firing and the entire tank body recoils backwards.The remote control takes four double A batteries and the tank itself charges from a cable attached to the side of the remote. Charging time is fairly quick and I've already gotten several hours of fun out of the tank and it's still going strong. The only reason I can't give it four stars is the tank just won't drive in a straight line. You can someone adjust for the tendency to turn by steering left or right as you go but it would have been just that much cooler if it had driven in a straight line. Still, I'm a fully grown adult and this is one of my favorite things.

"This is a great, fast to react and accurate pulse oximeter that's very easy to read. A free hint, use a dime or small flat screwdriver to pop open the battery compartment. It's not really rocketry science to pop the door off, insert the batteries and snap the cover back on.From start-up it takes approximately ten seconds to get the reading started. I took this to one of my doctor's offices during a visit on Friday and compared it to the one, a different brand, they use. The oxygen level was spot on and the pulse was off by two beats per minute which isn't any big deal.You can set different alert/alarm levels for too low/high pulse and too low oxygen levels as well as adjust the brightness of the display. The display can be rotated while in use so it can easily be read from the left, right or head on which I found to be an exceptionally handy function.I know the product description and literature state 'For Sports and Aviation Use Only' I'm absolutely certain this is exactly the same oximeter several nurses were using the last time I was in the hospital as well as the visiting nurses who regularly came after I was released. I think the disclaimer 'For Sports and Aviation Use Only' is there just to cover their behinds and while no one should rely on home diagnostics knowing your pulse and oxygen as well as other medical parameters is not a bad thing and can help you decided between a 911 call, a drive to the ER or waiting to see the doctor in the morning. The more information you can provide over the phone the better idea the medical professional you're calling the better idea they can have of your health. If I had one complaint it would be the lanyard. Now I know why none of these I see in offices or being carried by visiting nurses never have the lanyard attached. I spent fifteen minutes, ruined two pins and finally ended up running a length of fishing line through the miniscule holes provided for the lanyard, tied it off and popped it through. . . then I spent a few more minutes getting the fishing line untied.I received this item at a substantial discount from the regular price in exchange for my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH3218R6LXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017C0X3L8#wasThisHelpful","R3MH3218R6LXG","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"sThis is a decent, if small for the US market, thermos bottle. The blue color I received was a bit light but was still attractive. At best this holds 17 to 18 ounces of fluid and while it comes with a cup that doubles as a cap it holds less than ½ a cup when filled to the very rim. It reminds me of the cups that are used to serve espresso in. Still, it does fit nicely in the cup holder of our car and it's nice to have along on longer birding trips when you need a quick sip of cold water to wet the whistle.I've tested this with both cold and hot fluids. Both times I filled the thermos prior with cold or hot water to avoid temperature shock and extend the time the insulation would work.* Using cold water I put a few, three or four, small ice cubes in the bottle after tempering it with cool water for a while. I then filled the thermos from a water bottle kept in the 'fridge. After twelve hours although the ice cubes has melted the water was as cold as the moment it was poured from the 'fridge. Twenty-four hour later the water was still noticeably cooler than anything from the faucet and was still quite refreshing,*Using hot water. I again tempered the thermos for a while with the hottest water the faucet could produce. I allowed boiling water to cool for ten minutes or so to avoid melting the plastic parts. After six hours the water was nearly still hot enough to scald. Nine hours later and the water in the thermos was, were it tea or coffee, quite a good temperature for drinking. After twelve hours the water was still warm enough to be drinkable.I was happy with the performance of this thermos bottle with both cold and hot fluids, though I predict cold will be it's main use for me.Of note; there may be important care, maintenance or use instructions on the box. But none were printed in English.First and foremost should be the removal of the desiccate packet shipped in the thermos bottle. I almost overlooked the packet when I went to wash the thermos before it's first use.Secondly I've discovered that if you overfill the bottle the 'Open' button on the plug will not function. At least it would not for me. The cap displaced the water in the neck but created enough pressure when completely full I was utterly unable to operate the open/pour button built into the cap. Some fluid had to be drained out for this to become properly operational. I also noticed that although the bottle did not leak at all under normal use that if you closed the pour spout while still pouring it would tend to leak a small amount caught in the sealing mechanism.All in all I think I'll get a good deal of use out of this thermos. The build quality seems good although I wonder at the longevity of the open/pour function. Only time will tell there.

Maybe even more so, The writing is head and shoulders above the typical teen/tween offering from Disney or Nickelodeon. It's not insulting and doesn't talk down to the target audience, Yes, there's a moral or lesson to each episode but it doesn't feel forced into the show it feels natural. The main cast Sloane Morgan Siegel, Ashley Boettcher and Drew Justice have been slightly expanded with several reoccurring characters. Sloane, Ashley and Drew continue to feel, act and sound like real kids. I hope this show continues.

A little heavier than the lights that use button batteries but I really like keeping a handful of charged batteries around for whenever they need to be replaced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13XYMQ69E9KIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ITKKU8#wasThisHelpful","R13XYMQ69E9KIV","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the blue desk organizer. The construction is quite sturdy and there's plenty of storage spaces for pencils, pens, Post-It notes, stamps etc. It's great for organizing your desk. This would also be good in the kitchen or bathroom although I'm unsure of the metal it's made from, the product page just says 'metal' so it may rust in a damp bathroom environment. The blue is very attractive. The storage is useful and holds quite a lot. The rubber/plastic feet keep it from scratching your desk or counters. My only problem was the unit I received wasn't quite level but I found a thin piece of cardboard that I was able to double over and level out the unit. The wobbling was a bit annoying until I was able to get it leveled.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLG9JCGKN10AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MXR6GA#wasThisHelpful","RLG9JCGKN10AD","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design is nice. With a single speaker pointing upward it's not blaring into your face and you can use the ceiling or shelves above it to help disperse the sound around the room. Sound quality is good, a little more bass than high end but a good speaker for parties and hanging out and the volume level is loud enough to be heard easily from across the yard.Pairing with my ancient cell phone and Samsung tablet went flawlessly. The speaker comes with a carabiner (mine, unlike the blue one in the product images, was black) to hang or secure the speaker in place, a short dual 3.5mm ended cable for connecting MP3 players and such as well as a micro-USB cable for charging. There's also a micro-SD card slot so you can load the speaker with hours of your favorite music and go. Do note the water resistant properties are not functional when the cover over the charging or 3.5mm jack connectors is open. Speaking of water resistance; The product description here on Amazon claims this speaker complies with IPX5 water resistance specifications while the documentation included with the speaker states in two places that it's IPX4 certified. For those of you wondering about the IPX specifications are:* IPX4 - Protected against splashing water. 'Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect.'* IPX5 - Protected against Water jets. 'Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects.'Test durations and other IPX information is freely available online. I honestly don't know which to believe if this complies with IPX 4 or 5 standards. Personally I don't think I'd use it in the rain or shower but wouldn't worry about it getting wet with drips sitting pool side.The speaker has a decently attractive blue light ring around the bottom. I had hoped it might change color on a cycle but it stayed blue except when charging, then the light ring is red.The controls are. . . funky. The volume up/down buttons and the next/previous buttons are the same. You have to long press either to change the volume even a little. I repeatedly found myself tapping the buttons for a little more/less volume and switching songs instead. It's something of an annoyance you just have to deal with if you're using the speaker itself to control things (especially true if using a micro-SD card).In the end. . . Good sound. Decent looking. Handy carabiner. At least IPX4 level water resistance. A little hard to use. Okay battery life of about four hours. A little slow to charge, instructions state four hours to full charge. Not a bad speaker at all.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XH7OODY480GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF0D6Q6#wasThisHelpful","R1XH7OODY480GP","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the black version of this saw. The four ounce saw comes in a decently sturdy nylon pouch that securely clasps shut and has a belt loop so you can carry it on your belt or, as I di, on one of the multiple straps on my backpack. Sure, I'd rather have a nice, heavy axe or gas powered chain-saw for that matter but this ultra light weight saw is crazy sharp and something that doesn't add huge weight or bulk to your gear. It's only a few ounces, why not carry it with you as an emergency backup? The handles are big enough for even the biggest of hands. The twenty-four inch cutting blade is very much like an actual chain-saw blade unlike the 'diamond' impregnated wire saws that rarely, if ever, work.

"I like that this charges via a USB cable and can charge from your computer or just about any Kindle, tablet or cell phone wall charger. That makes it pretty handy. But. . . there's always a but, and that comes along with the twelve dollar price for this charger and including a spare battery, I paid more than that for a better known brand replacement battery alone when I got my Fujifilm X-E2.The charger works, about three to four hours for a full charge from my laptop's USB port. But the but is here. The quality of the charger body is light, thin plastic that feels like I could easily snap it. The charging contacts are very thin and light metal that could easily be bent out of place. It's really like you're paying for a replacement NP-W126 battery and they're throwing in a freebie USB charger. It's more inexpensive than cheap but in total it's not high quality but you're not paying a high quality premium here. You honestly get what you pay for with this charger and battery. It's going in my gear bag where it' going to get bounced around for charging on the road.The battery itself that's included fit my Fujifilm X-E2 perfectly. I didn't have a chance to get it out in the field for a solid test but I was able to sit here in the house using my 18-55 lens. I changed focus and zoom repeatedly. I used the flash for at least twenty shot. The battery was still going strong after over two hundred shots. It seems to be a good quality replacement NP-W126 battery.Charging couldn't be simpler. The unit's single LED light is red while the battery is charging and once fully charged the light turns blue. I tested this with the included battery, an actual Fuji brand NP-W126 battery and another replacement brand cell. All appeared to charge well.I received this kit in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTGWX2GLK1F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P66G9YE#wasThisHelpful","R3BTGWX2GLK1F4","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the blue version of this credit card wallet. The blue at first seems much darker in person than shown on Amazon. But once you get it in brighter light (and realize the photographs, mine included, were taken with a flash)  it seems closer to the color displayed on the product information page. The wallet is nicely light with plenty of room for credit cards, IDs and we keep lists of family medications handy in it as well. The only thing I wouldn't keep in this is cash, except maybe for an emergency $20 or so, since cash has to be folded so many times it becomes difficult to count out and can really annoy a cashier trying to get it into their register. Of note, in one of the product pictures on Amazon 'Shell-D' is displayed prominently on the outside of the case. On the one I received the external case had no markings and the 'Shell-D' was printed on the inside.The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is the hinge and latch are somewhat cheap. The latch opens very easily. Even my 84 year old mother with bad arthritis has no problem opening this and I hope with care the case gives a few years of service but the quality, especially of the hinges, could have been better.I recommend this more for front pocket or jacket carrying as it's a bit uncomfortable in the back pocket.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEHBY35EMLLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSDG8IK#wasThisHelpful","RHEHBY35EMLLE","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose the bronze credit card  wallet over the gold (a little gaudy) and the silver (a little old fashioned) and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The bronze tone is subtle yet distinctive enough to b eye catching. The embossed pattern on the case really is beautiful and well done. Lines were even weight and thickness and there's just enough room left in the center medallion for a small initial engraving. Thought I don't know if engraving could negatively effect the RFID blocking. The wallet, even though it's metal is not that heavy and weighs in a little less than my quality all leather wallet.I like this for credit cards, they stay in place fairly well and can be removed and replaced SO much easier than those old style plastic sleeves that entirely cover your cards. Just make sure you open it upright and with care as cards can fall out when opened upside down. This is slightly less useful for cash which needs to be folded three or four times over to fit which makes it a pain to count bills out, limits the amount you can carry and  will really annoy cashiers trying to get the money into their registers (having been a cashier I can attest to this). I would recommend carrying this in a jacket or the front pants pocket. There's no give like a leather wallet and carrying this in your back pocket could be a little uncomfortable.The catch is fairly easy to open but I found, due to some disability issues, I had to stop and really pay attention to what I was doing.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26N8528AX1N6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBWTDY6#wasThisHelpful","R26N8528AX1N6P","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The flavor makes a decided change about half-way through the mint.While it really isn't exactly Cherry Cola flavored it does have a distinct and interesting flavor.

"I checked this against a different kitchen scale and the weights were spot on. This scale has a single monolithic top where you can place just about anything you want to weigh. Even though it's easy to clean you might want to put a sheet of plastic wrap over it when measuring wet, messy products that may cross contaminate.The scale has two buttons mounted just under the front edge. One being a power button that also doubles as a tare (labeled 'zero' here) function. You can continually add products while removing the weight of the item(s) you've already weighed. This is great for baking, you don't have to pre-weigh items, just put down a bowl on the scale, hit the tare/zero button and add each ingredient repeating the process. The second button switches between Imperial weight & fluids and metric weight and fluids.This runs on two, included, AAA batteries that are easy to replace in a compartment on the bottom of the unit. About the only thing I really don't  care for about this scale is the red LED style display. It's very. . . 1980's feeling though it is quite readable.

"First off the ear bud/ear pieces are huge and made of metal. They're uncomfortable to wear and no matter which plug combinations you use they tend to easily fall right out of your ears. Secondly the controls are just off one of the ear pieces. They're impossible to see that close to your ear and it takes a while to memorize the controls so in the meantime you're yanking a bud out of your ear to see what you're doing. Also the cord isn't quite long enough so these have a tendency to slide completely off your neck when an ear bud pops out while exercising and you're hands are busy.Sound quality was mediocre with flat heavy bass that managed to lack punch and the high ends are muddy and confused. I also noted one side sounded much worse than the other. Not only myself but two other people I showed these to said one side had worse sound.While they call these 'sport' and sweatproof, the charging plug opening has no cover. One seems to be shown in a couple of the product pictures but the set I received have the USB plug completely wide open for sweat or rain to easily get in. I wouldn't recommend these headphones.

"The wallet is very nicely made with even and straight stitching it appears to be real leather. The product description here on Amazon says Napa leather but I did noticed that other than 'Leopardd' there was nothing else stamped or printed in or on the wallet. The black color I received (a chocolate brown is also available.) has a nice finish. It's not overly glossy, much more of a satin finish which I really appreciate.There are two bill pockets each more than big enough for US money. There are six credit card slots divided into two sections one on either side of the wallet. Under each of the credit card sections there's a small 'extra' pocket. I keep my list of medications and doctor's in one. On the left side (inside, opening the wallet) is a flip-up pocket with a clear cover suitable for an ID or driver's license. This pocket is tight enough to hold your ID in place but not so tight you'll fight with it if you're asked to remove it.

"Torn between three and four stars. The flower designs themselves are four star work all day long. They're well drawn, very pretty and complex enough to present a challenge. Then you come to the border that's added to each image. They seem to have been made deliberately complex. Far more so than the flower designs they surround. Those I feel deserve three stars, Deliberately done to confuse and humble the colorist. Not the best collection of work.

"There's a happy medium to be found in adult coloring books. On one side are designs so complex they take hours to decipher let alone color. The creators revel in complexities that confound the normal eye to see. Where one mistake can ruin hours of work. On the other hand there are adult coloring books whose designs look as if they're children's drawings from the back of the 'fridge with the color removed or, worse (I've been there) the barely legible scribbles of adults in long term care facilities to color. I find both ends of this spectrum, and lets not pretend they don't exist, to be insulting and a waste of money. Images so simple; cat, broom, bucket, table or so complex they were likely computer generated are ridiculous. Sitting down to color, to relax, let off some stress and express a little creativity are sometimes hard to find. This book 'Simply Circular Designs Coloring Book' by Dover Press is the perfect middle ground between complexity and simplicity. You can put as much or as little as you like into the work and still enjoy the process. We've bought adult coloring books for years and will certainly be looking for more right along these lines. This is one of the best design books put together.

"Three stars here, in the end, it's Hershey's chocolate and if you were raised on it and never tasted a quality chocolate you'll likely be happy with these. I had hopes that Hershey's had changed and/or improved their recipe in the twenty or so years since I last ate some but they haven't.  These are edible, don't get me wrong. They won't make you sick but the milk chocolate is a bit oily and bland. The dark chocolate is a little better but it lacks the bite of a true dark chocolate. The caramel isn't chewy like what I expect from a chocolate covered caramel. It's very. . . smooth, it melts very easily with a slightly oily feel.

"My review is of the 5-liter version of the LifeStraw mission water purifier.Assembly and set up are unbelievably easy. Fill the roll-bag with the cleanest water you have access to. Roll, seal and hang the bag using the handy nylon strap they include. Attach the hose (which also easily detaches) and let the water begin to flow. Purge the red valve which is bad water and then wait for the water to begin flowing from the blue valve which is the good water. Detailed instructions are included and printed on the roll-bag. The kit also comes with a handy stuff sack and a couple extra primary filters which mount inside the roll-bag.The 5-liter size is good enough for two people, perhaps two adults and a child. For more people you're going to want the higher capacity bag or more than one of these 5-liter kits. I wanted to give this an honest trial. I almost went with the pool water but the chlorine and other chemicals worried me and after an email from the company I'm glad I didn't. Under no circumstances should you attempt to filter pool water. Luckily we received a good amount of rain. Water drains out of our neighborhood through a system of swales and where it runs across our yard we have a good grass base for it to flow across. We took our bag full of water from the front yard and followed all the instructions very carefully.

"I was torn between three and four stars for this review. The holder is cute and a quick glance can make you think of a leaking bucket and a puddle of water. It's a fun addition to the desk. That's four-stars worthy. On the other hand the plastic 'water' is fragile and cheap and the falling section feels like it could easily snap under moderate pressure. Where it attaches to the bucket there's nothing keeping it in place. I wouldn't put a lot in the bucket, a few pencils, a couple pens, maybe some hard candy but not much else. That's the three-star part, the quality is pretty poor. But it's still cute so it gets the four for now.

"One look at the product images and the ones I'll upload with my review and you'll be asking yourself the same thing I did. ""How come what was delivered looks nothing like what's advertised?"" The advertised product shows large chunks of salt much closer to the 6mm size of the 3 - 6mm advertised. The salt I received is far closer to 1 - 3mm with very, very few larger pieces and maybe a scant handful that come close to 6mm in size. It still works in my grinder but it's not what I expected when I ordered this bag of salt. I understand this is a natural product and there are vagaries in size with such products but what I received looks nothing like what I ordered.

"Well, the timers are pretty colors. That's about all the good I can say about them as a whole. Once I got these I broke out a stopwatch app for Windows that I also tested for accuracy. Once I knew the stopwatch was accurate I tested these timers several times from each side.The results were as follows:The 30 second timer - AccurateThe 01 minute timer - AccurateThe 02 minute timer - one side of the timer was repeatedly 01 second fast. Flipping the timer it repeatedly was 09 seconds slow.The 03 minute timer - was +/- 01 second on either side.The 05 minute timer - repeatedly 25/26 seconds slow on one side. Repeatedly a full minute slow on the other side.The 10 minute timer - repeatedly 1:35 seconds from one side. Over two minutes slow from the other.You could use the 30 second, 01 minute and 03 minute timers. The other three range from bad to ridiculously bad for keeping time. They're kinda cute.

"This interchangeable magnifying glass set is quite handy. My mother enjoys doing crafts and some of the instructions and labels are just too small for her to read. She had been using an antique glass that has been in the family for years but it lacked a light. The light on this handle, powered by three AAA batteries, is very bright and perfectly placed for using these lenses. This set comes with three detachable lenses; 2.5x, 5x and 16x. To be honest the 16x lens is a little too small and so thick very little of it is usable for focus. We put that lens aside and have kept the 5x lens mounted on the handle.

"Pretty copper mugs. A little on the thin side and they're copper plated (they say coated) stainless steel. They're not double walled so don't expect any insulating properties but these are nice, though they do sweat and condense so use a coaster if you use ice. Do note, these are metal, metal conducts heat well and rapidly. Use caution if you use these or any other metal vessel for hot drinks. Another thing to note is these will pick up oily or greasy finger prints quite easily. To the very rim they hold 16 Oz. leaving a little room so you don't spill your drink everywhere you're looking at more like 14 Oz. of capacity.

"The shape and style of this diffuser is a bit. . . bland. In reality is a squat white plastic tower with two buttons on the back and a vent on the top for the vapor. But then you turn the light on and it fills the room with a captivating light show as it slowly cycles through a multitude of colors. The diffuser can be set to run for 60, 180, 360 minutes or continually until the water reservoir runs low. You can also run the light show with the misting feature off. One other light setting, pure white in high, warm and low is also available.I use a good grade Sandalwood oil with ours. With the diffuser full to just above half full the output isn't strong, a stream about four to six inches can be seen and the scent is light in  large room. But once you get don below the halfway full point the output greatly increases as does the potency and reach of the scent.

"We burn these several times a day often lighting more than one stick at a time here in the living room and I also burn one stick at night to help me drift off to sleep. The scent is light and a little sweet with woodsy undertones. We find the scent incredibly relaxing and pleasant. Each stick burns for approximately twenty to twenty-five minutes and the scent lingers a half hour afterwards. Each box comes with a small blue ceramic tile to stand the incense sticks up, we have a small brass candy dish we use to collect the ash and using the tiles does leave a small unburned stub which I collect, save, and occasionally burn on a charcoal plug for use in a brazier. I discovered Morning Star Sandalwood incense in the 1980's and have been buying them ever since. This is our favorite incense brand and favorite scent from them. These ship surprisingly well.

You can adjust the amount of scent released with a slider on top of the unit. The clip fits the vents on our car perfectly. It's out of the way in the corner and doesn't interfere with aiming the airflow at all. I get approximately three weeks in the summer with the clips set to the middle scent flow setting.

"This is a review of the ten (10) foot 3.5mm to 3.5mm (male to male) audio cable. The cable I selected has a light blue band on each of the cable ends. The cable had the appearance of a woven cord cable when I saw the product listing but slightly disappointing the woven effect is just appears to be molded into a stiff plastic outer covering. I don't understand the use of zip-ties to coil the cable, they were very hard to remove.  When used to connect two devices to one another it's fine. I use the cable to connect a pair of dual use, wireless and wired, headphones to my laptop which lacks Bluetooth connectivity. Using this way I have to take care to keep the cable from rubbing on my neck while I'm sitting here listening to music or watching videos. The cord is rather. . . scratchy, rough and uncomfortable against my bare skin. The audio quality is fantastic the only other thing you have to watch out for is the cable rubbing against itself especially the couple feet closest to the headphones. The sound of rubbing transmits readily through the hard plastic coating. So, okay, the cable is scratchy and sound is transmitted if the cable rubs. Even with those small flaws the audio quality is great and the extra range is a great plus.

"I can't give this five stars, I just can't. Most importantly because this is goodbye. What a long strange trip it's been folks. I still remember looking at the cover of 'The Colour of Magic' in the bookstore and thinking what the heck am I in for. I vividly remember telling my friends that they had to read this insane book I'd found and trying to describe it to them. Now here we are, it's over. In the past it never felt like Terry was milking the popularity to rake in more cash. Every book felt fresh and new, until now, here at the end of all things Discworld.I understand Terry Pratchett was ill and not at the top of his game while writing Shepherd's Crown but I just couldn't love this book like I have the past dozens. The dialog seems wrong. The ending felt all too easy. At the halfway point I fairly accurately predicted the ending. It just happened, poof, it's over. Nowhere did the conflict feel like conflict. No one was in any real danger. . . well, okay, one person was but I guessed that part too.I finished the book. Now I'm sad. I'm sad that this last Discworld book wasn't all that great. In fact, as I've been writing this review I've lowered it from four stars to three. According to Amazon three stars means ""It's okay"" and that all I really can say about it and that makes me even sadder.

"We're no strangers to Hefty Odor Block tall kitchen trash bags. We've been using the Lavender & Vanilla scent bags forever, we very much enjoy the scent. Those and the Unscented varieties were all our local grocery store carried. When the Clean Apple became available for review I jumped at the chance to try a different scent. Using the Lavender & Vanilla when you 'pop' the bag open before putting it in the can that area of the kitchen fills with the scent. While not overpowering that scent is present upwards of two days. when you throw something out you get a little waft of the perfume. Imagine my surprise when opening the box of Clean Apple scent bags and barely being able to smell anything with my nose up against the brand new package of bags. It was time to take the trash out anyhow so I brought one of the Clean Apple bags into the kitchen and shook it open and there was barely any scent when I'm used to a much more potent perfume.These bags perform as well as the Lavender & Vanilla and Unscented varieties. They're very durable and will hold a lot of trash without failing. The drawstrings are long enough where I can make a neck at the top of the bag and tie it off tightly so no smells can escape while the bags sit in the town's collection bin for up to a week waiting for collection in the Florida summer heat. We've tried other brands when there have been sales and were not happy with them. The Hefty Odor Block Drawstring bags are the ones we keep coming back to. The Clean Apple are a strong bag and they do appear to keep odor in they just don't have enough of a scent for us.

"Berry flavored evil is what this is. I know it's a 'thing' down here in the South, I don't know how they do it. The first time I tried it the powder coated the inside of my mouth and took forever to get the taste out. The fruit 'flavor' tastes like the cheapest dollar store punch crossed with the bitter acidic tang of aspirin. It was absolutely horrible and it lingers forever.Each powder packet contains 325mg of Acetaminophen, 500mg of Aspirin, and 65mg of Caffeine. An okay mixture for mild to maybe slightly moderate pain or headaches. It did seem to take effect a little quicker than taking tablets or capsules but the few extra minutes shaved off taking the powder is offset by its horrible flavor and grainy mouth feel. I think I'd rather have a headache than ever take this again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSAR32M5T6HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPFWC#wasThisHelpful","RSAR32M5T6HR","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice pair of 18650 2600mAh rechargeable batteries. They came in a sturdy well fitting plastic case. Out of the box they had some charge in them but I put them in my charger to top them off. It took a few hours to bring the batteries up to full charge. I tested these in two devices; a headlamp rig that's designed for 18650 batteries. Performance was great. Light output was as good as with any other cells. I used the light for a couple hours and noticed no change in the light intensity. I topped the batteries off again and using an adapter put one cell in a flashlight that normally uses the much larger 26650 6800mAh battery and the light was just as bright. I am quite pleased with the performance as well as the included storage box.I received this item in exchange for my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SQEO5085QT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFHPORM#wasThisHelpful","R6SQEO5085QT8","A1MCH5RXDOH87H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCH5RXDOH87H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Please note that this review contains spoilers.Can even Superman survive when the power of the atom is released?In this alternate reality of a world gone mad, it seems as if everyone dies, including Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Lex Luther, and many other ""heroes and villains"".This is all caused by the Flash when he travels back in time to change an important event in his life.  This change goes horribly wrong by creating major ripples in time, leading to an all out and devasting war between the underwater people of Atlantis and the warrior Amazon women.How does this war start?  Picture the somewhat graphic image of Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) of the Amazons holding in her hand the lifeless head of Queen Mera, wife of King Aquaman of Atlantis....  By the end of this saga, the war becomes all consuming and horrific in its nature.Please note that there are many graphic images, including the usual guns and bullets, arrows and swords, blood and gore, people pounding with no mercy on people, and of people being blown to bits.  There are sea monsters, helping Atlantis, and land monsters from Greek mythology, helping the Amazons.  I don't want to overstate the violence, but you may want to preview this animated war film.  For many, it may not be appropriate for young children.  This is not your usual Saturday children's animated hero show.However, there is one graphic scene with Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) that really shocked me.  In this segment, Queen Diana battles a Captain Marvel like character and subdues him with her magic lasso.  Queen Diana forces him to say Shazam,  reverting him back to 6 children.  Off camera, Queen Diana puts one of the kids to the sword (and presumably the other 5 kids as well!).  Wow, that really stunned me.Furthermore, wonder what happens when Queen Diana meets Steve Trevor?  Well, their first meeting is his last meeting.Aquaman is equally evil and without mercy.  He thrusts his trident into Lex Luther and rips Cyborg apart, piece by piece, revealing Cyborg's beating heart.  And Aquaman plays a pivotal part in starting the war when he commits a major indiscretion, showing a great lapse in moral judgement.By the decisions made by Aquaman and Queen Diana, parts of the earth are laid waste.The main characters in this film are Flash, Batman, and Cyborg, along with Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  Superman's character and Hal Jordan play minor roles.  There are quite a few supporting characters including versions of Aqualad, Black Manta, Ocean Master, and assorted villains and heroes.Finally, on an emotional note, there is Barry Allen (Flash) and his relationship with his mother and there is an unusual twist involving Bruce Wayne and his father, Dr. Wayne.  There is also a tragic and not so funny implied twist regarding Bruce Wayne's mother....  She's quite mad, just like this twisted alternate world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YDOON01H39H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CENWUYK#wasThisHelpful","R15YDOON01H39H","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this product to treat my Clivia seeds.  It dramatically improves the rate of germination by preventing the seeds from turning into mush.  It helps prevent the seeds from being eaten by some kind of mold.  When I do not use this product, a lot of the seeds get mushy.The plastic container contains a light yellow powder which you mix with water.  You have to be careful and make sure the dust doesn't fly everywhere.  A small amount of it will get in the air, but it doesn't seem to cause a problem for me.  Obviously, try not to breathe it into your lungs.  If you want, you may wear an air mask.Here are directions which include information from other websites for growing Clivia seeds.  This is what you do with your Bonide Captan solution.1. Use the solution to soak the Clivia seeds overnight.  If the seeds are older, soak longer.  If fresh, overnight soaking is fine.  I also sometimes put in soluble seaweed as a light and natural fertilizer with the Bonide Captan solution.2. Treat the soil with the Bonide Captan solution.3. Clivia seeds have a tiny dark spot.  Plant with the dark spot facing up.  Plant about half the seed and leave the other half exposed to the air and bright light.  I noticed that seeds exposed to light germinate, while the seeds which I buried more deeply with no light may not germinate so you may even expose more of the seed to the air and light.4. Cover the seeds with plastic or other cover to keep the seeds moist.5. Every so often, check your seeds and spray or water the seeds with the Bonide Captan solution to keep the seeds moist.6. Keep the seeds warm.7. I also water occasionally with a strong solution of soluble seaweed. Pour a little bit of this fertilizer over each seed.  For example, once, when three of the four seeds had leaf growth and the fourth one did not, I poured the soluble seaweed on the fourth one and I saw leaf growth on that seed.  It doesn't always work, but it does seem to help.The most important thing is to get fresh seeds which tend to be large and white and firm.  They germinate fast.  Older seeds are wrinkled and more shriveled looking and may not germinate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27F4GNWN0E37R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BO65WQ#wasThisHelpful","R27F4GNWN0E37R","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seaweed fertilizer is soluble like other fertilizers in which you put a small amount into a container and mix it with water to use.What I got was 10 pounds of soluble kelp or seaweed in a large heavy-duty plastic bag, shipped in a cardboard box.It's a bit messy to separate the large mix into smaller containers, but it's worth it because the price is lower when purchased in bulk.  The price is less than half and it looks similar to (or it may actually be the same) high quality Norwegian kelp which is sold on the market.This kelp or seaweed is an excellent and natural source of fertilizer for your plants.  It is not too strong, so it will not burn your plants.  (Chemical fertilizers may burn your plants.) The only thing you have to be aware is that the kelp may leave a brown stain on white or light-colored shirts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4HCPLLCU03K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1ZLKUW#wasThisHelpful","R2P4HCPLLCU03K","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered a few plants on March 12, 2013 and they arrived four days later on March 16, so delivery was prompt.The Clivia plants have between 4 to 7 smaller leaves.  Clivias need about 13 large leaves before they flower so I am guessing that these plants may bloom in 3 to 5 years.  Keeping the young plants growing year round should help speed leaf development.The plants are already in 4 inch green plastic containers filled with soil so it's probably best to leave them in their pots to grow.Here's the only thing which I changed. I took the plant and the soil out of the container and threw in 3 or 4 styrofoam peanuts (not the biodegradable ones) into the bottom of the container and then I put the plant and the soil back into the pot.  Hopefully, this should help keep the roots from sitting in water and prevent root rot, a too common Clivia problem.I wish that they had a few more leaves but they are nice plants.

"This is a nice and compact radio, small enough for your desk or bedroom.

Manual, warranty, and quick start guideThe radio is also portable and it uses 4 AA batteries (not included).October 26, 2012 UpdateThe radio came just in time for Hurricane Sandy which is projected to hitDelaware Bay on the East Coast before Halloween.October 29, 2012 UpdateI was listening to the weather when the alert sounded.  The ""alert"" (actually an ""alarm"") for coastal flooding is LOUD!November 2, 2012 UpdateSo, on October 29, the eye of Hurricane Sandy passed through southern New Jersey, causing damage to New Jersey's shoreline and the New York City area.Here, in Rhode Island, which is located just under Massachusetts, Sandy caused minimal damage.  Newport and the capital city, Providence, are fine.  There was damage to part of the southern coastal areas where beachhouses were destroyed and power was out for a few days.~~~This product is intuitive to use.

"I have had the Triceptor for quite a few years now.  I use it for pushups and triceps dips.The machine comes with  2 handle bars which you insert into 2 holes on various top and bottom positions.Here's what you can do with it.1. Pushups in various easier positions from narrow to wide, along with increasing resistance levels.2. Dips which is the first internet image (actually showing an intense or harder version), along with easier versions.3. Inverted rows which is an easier version of pullups.Please look at the 5 internet images which show the above 3 exercises.In general, pushups work your chest, dips work your triceps, and inverted rows work your back.Basically, it lets you to do easier versions of pushups, dips, and pullups which you may have difficulty doing.  It's a good machine for anyone who can't do full versions of upper body exercises and want to get back in shape gradually.  After you build up, you can play with it a little by increasing reps and moving faster.For example, it's good if you have issues doing regular full body pushups on the floor.  I started doing a few pushups with the bars on the top positions.  Gradually, I increased the number of reps and increased rep speed.  You may move the 2 handle bars into different positions and work the chest slightly differently each time.  Moving the hands close together puts more emphasis on the triceps and inner chest.  A wide pushup with hands further apart works the outer chest.It may also be useful for more experienced exercisers.  The first dip image shown is actually an advanced exercise.  Plus, having your hand and body in different positions adds variety and works your body in different ways.  You may also lower the handle bars closer to the floor which increases resistance or weight.  Finally, moving your feet further away or elevating your feet adds intensity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6S8OYUUL7VIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FR9LM0#wasThisHelpful","R6S8OYUUL7VIY","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This flat band measures 4"" across in width which is the same as other bands.  (This is not rubber tubing, the round band, but it is used in the same way.)I think that this green resistance level is a good starter band for beginners or regular exercises since you can cut it shorter to increase resistance or longer to decrease resistance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKFPWZ8SHC56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0008JHBM8#wasThisHelpful","RUKFPWZ8SHC56","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Chest, Shoulders, & Tri's (45:18)Warmup (4:19):Workout (34:52):Cool-down (5:57):The main workouts (excluding the warmups and the cool-downs) vary from about 18 minutes to about 46 minutes, with many close to 30 minutes, so these are relatively short workouts.The workouts use dumb-bells and a large Swiss ball. You need moderate to medium weight dumb-bells, but you can do the exercises without the ball. I did not use the ball, although I do have a bench.~~~~~This 10 DVD set provides excellent instruction on using dumb-bells in a programmed and well structured sequence. This program is fairly intense and it might take a little while to build up, especially if you are a beginner. This may be better suited for someone with exercise experience or it may considered an intermediate DVD.All the talent, (men and women demonstrators), are extremely fit and sometimes go fast, on many of the exercises, especially push-ups. After quite a few months, I find that I can go fast on push-ups too. On the jumping (plyometrics), I walked in place (slow or fast) or stepped side to side, instead of doing the jumping. Walking is a lot easier if you have knee or feet issues.Tom Holland is the instructor and he is pleasant, affable and knowledgeable","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMJBKP3HXHS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097TZ9C4#wasThisHelpful","RIMJBKP3HXHS5","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You need moderate to medium weight dumb-bells, but you can do the exercises without the ball. I did not use the ball, although I do have a bench.~~~~~This 10 DVD set provides excellent instruction on using dumb-bells in a programmed and well structured sequence. This program is fairly intense and it might take a little while to build up, especially if you are a beginner. This may be better suited for someone with exercise experience or it may considered an intermediate DVD.All the talent, (men and women demonstrators), are extremely fit and sometimes go fast, on many of the exercises, especially push-ups. After quite a few months, I find that I can go fast on push-ups too. On the jumping (plyometrics), I walked in place (slow or fast) or stepped side to side, instead of doing the jumping. Walking is a lot easier if you have knee or feet issues.Tom Holland is the instructor and he is pleasant, affable and knowledgeable","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HX2YWJG3I7X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HFQBS0#wasThisHelpful","R3HX2YWJG3I7X1","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered 10 Hawaiian peacock Jasmine plants from Rush Gardening on September 14, 2012 and they arrived on October 11, 2012.  They arrived in good condition, sealed in 2 hard plastic containers.  Each plastic container contains 5 live plants or soil plugs.2 plants are 9"" tall.3 plants are 8"" tall.1 plant is 7 1/2"" tall.2 plants are 7"" tall.2 plants are 6"" tall.Plants have about 6 to 10 green leaves.  These starter plants are vining plants.~~~I have had these plants previously and they are easy to grow.  Basically, keep them warm, in a sunny window, with the soil on the moist side, just as if they were in Hawaii.  In about a little more than a month, buds or little fragrant white flowers may appear, especially if you keep them warm and sunny.  Flowers last only a day or so.Here are quick directions.1. In the North, put them in a sunny window with warm temperatures.2. Keep the soil on the moist side or the plant will dry up.3. Fertilize lightly to increase flower production.  Strong fertilizer may burn and kill the plants.4. Keep the plants above 55 degrees.  Plants may not survive lower temperatures.5. Prune because the flowers come at the tips of new growth.~~~Here are the instructions from Rush Gardening.""Place in a sunny window, keeping the soil evenly moist. Avoid very high temperatures, but also at a minimum of 55 degrees F. Feed every three weeks with liquid fertilizer, except in fall when growth appears to have slowed.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IY3AU8B0KEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SNNL9C#wasThisHelpful","R17IY3AU8B0KEO","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered a Hawaiian Pink Quill Plant (Tillandsia cyanea) 4"" Pot from Hirt's Gardens on September 24, 2012 and it arrived 3 days later on September 27.

"I ordered this plant June 22, 2012 and it arrived three days later on June 25. It came wrapped in a 4 inch round plastic container with the leaves wrapped in paper, with recyclable peanuts for protection.What you see on the internet image is somewhat similar to what I got in the mail.  It is a regular-sized plant with about 11 leaves, appropriate for a 4 inch pot.  Leaves are about 6 inches in length and about 3 inches in width. Newer leaves have a lemon color, while the older leaves have a lime color.There is one differnce.  This plant has two separate growing stems growing very closely to each other, instead of just one stem.  So I guess, I got a double plant.(I actually ordered this plant under a different item name, but Hirt's sent me this plant.  Since I have this plant, I decided to review this product, here, as it is the same plant.)September 17, 2012 UpdateI have been giving the plant a little filtered sun from the window and I water only occasionally. It is doing great and it is growing healthy new leaves.September 26, 2012 UpdateI increased by a little the amount of sun it was getting.  The sun is still filtered through the window so it is a ""light"" sun, rather than a strong noon day sun.  The plant is still doing great and it continues to produce new leaves.The plant has 20 leaves as of September, while it had 11 leaves in June.

"I ordered Jasmine sambac - Belle of India - 6"" Pot from Hirt's Gardens on September 18, 2012 and it arrived 3 days later on September 21.  It arrived in excellent condition in a 6"" plastic green pot, packed with foam peanuts for protection.This is the largest jasmine I have received of all the various jasmines I have ordered through the mail.It is about 20 inches tall and 16 1/2 inches across the width.  It has 13 white buds or nickle-sized flowers.  It has a multitude of healthy green leaves.  This is a ""full plant"" with about 9 woody stems coming out of the soil.  (I ordered the same Jasmine from another place and it only had one woody stem, with leaves and no flowers, coming out of the soil.)  Again, this is a most impressive plant.Please note that this plant requires full sun (not partial) and warm temperatures to bloom.~~~Here are directions which I pulled from the internet.1. In general, jasmines flower on new wood so prune to encourage new growth.2. Minimum temperature for ""Belle of India"" is 60 degrees F.3. Plant enjoys full sun and warm temperatures. Provide as much sun as you can for optimal flowering.4. Fertilize lightly for more flowers. Do not over fertilize.~~~Separately, if you want a most floriferous scented Jasmine, try ""Poet's Jasmine 6 inch Pot (Jasminum officinale)"" from Hirt's Gardens.I ordered it late September of 2012 and it has the most flowers of any and all Jasmines which I have ordered through the internet.  Make sure you get the large plant in the 6"" pot, not the tiny little one in a 4"" pot.~~~Here is a comparison between the two Jasmines.Belle of India1. Needs full sun (not partial sun) to encourage blooms.2. Needs warm temperatures to bloom.  It does not tolerate cool/cold temperatures. (Website indicates that 60 degree F is the minimum temperature.  Keep it above 60 at night or plant may not survive.)3. Since the plant likes full sun and warm temperatures, you may have to water this plant more often than other regular houseplants.4. It is supposed to bloom throughout the year, if you give it the required warm temperatures and full sun.Poet's Jasmine1. Partial sun and bright light is ideal.2. Give cool nights (like an outside porch in the cool Spring or cool Fall) to encourage blooms.3. In September, when I got it, it had the most flowers of any of the Jasmines which I have ordered through the internet.  It is October now and it is still blooming in the porch which has cool nights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PC4E4PQKZMZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SOX1H0#wasThisHelpful","R1PC4E4PQKZMZA","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Croton Mammy # 1I placed a few plant orders from Emerald Goddess Gardens around September of 2012 and they sent me a free bonus plant.The plant appears to be a ""Croton Dwarf Corkscrew Mammy Fire 4 inch Pot"" or a plant similar to it.This Croton is a woody stem and is about 16"" high as measured from the base of the plant with the measurement not including the root ball.  The root ball is wrapped securely in plastic.  It has 24 glossy leaves.  In general, leaves are about 4 inches across the length and 1 inch in width. Leaves are richly multicolored and include the following colors: green red dark brown, yellow, red, and green.  The new leaves are green with a yellow stripe in the middle, along with yellow edgings.

Give a little sun, bright light, or light shade.  Shade is o.k., but it reduces leaf color and plant may become spindly.4. You may prune 1/4 of the top in mid-Summer.5.

"I ordered a ""red Christmas Cactus - Zygocactus - 6"" Hanging Basket"" from Hirt's Nurseries on September 17, 2012 and it arrived 3 days later on September 20.  It was packed with recyclable peanuts and wrapped in a plastic bag so it came in excellent condition.The plant is contained in a white 6"" hanging basket.  It could easily be put into a 7"" pot so the plant is well-sized.  It is 8"" tall and 12"" wide and it is tightly jam packed with healthy green stems so it can be divided right now.~~~I plan to put this plant in the enclosed porch.  I live in the North, so when the night temperatures dip in the Fall, Christmas cactus automatically produces flower buds.  Just remember to bring it indoors before the night temperatures hit 32 degrees or the plant will die.It may also be possible to get it to bloom in the Spring.  Put it back outside after Winter when the night temperatures are above 32 degrees.  The only concern is to avoid a late frost or freeze in the Spring.  You have to bring the plant back inside whenever the night temperatures start to dip to the danger zone of 32 degrees.  After the danger of freezing has passed, put it back outside to let it enjoy the cool nights which help provide the conditions needed for flower buds.For me, this worked on one very large, healthy, and mature Christmas cactus, but it did not work on the smaller Christmas cactus.  The larger Christmas cactus was located next to an open window so the cool air circulated to it, while the smaller one was in a warmer location away from the open window's cool air.It is also easy to grow new plants.  Whenever a few pieces break off, just put them in soil.  You could also break off a few sections (make sure the section contains 3 or more segments), let it dry for a couple of days, and pop it in the soil.Give plants some filtered sun, but not too much.  Water like regular houseplants.  Remember that these plants originate from Brazil where it rains a lot so they need more water than regular cacti.  As with most plants, drain excess water from the saucer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LDH14V521WJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YFA5HY#wasThisHelpful","R3LDH14V521WJB","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The second branch is about 16"" tall and has 11 large glossy green leaves.I did some research and it appears that Sheryl's Shop sent me a different plant -  Sheryl's Shop sent me a different type of gardenia.Hirt's sent me the correct gardenia.  So, get your Tahitian Gardenia from Hirt's Gardens, because it sent me the correct plant and because it has a flower bud.October 9, 2012 Update - ""Spicy"" gardenia scentA flower bud started to open yesterday.  I measured it today and it has a diameter of about 4 1/2"".  The white (or light cream) flower has a spicy gardenia scent which, while being fairly strong, is not as heavy as other gardenias.  The scent may drift several feet in a room and from a short distance I can catch a whiff of it sometimes.  One co-worker thought that the scent was strong enough to give him a headache.  This flower has almost a sort of a whirly shape to its form.October 12, 2012 UpdateThe flower fell off today so flowers may last about 3 or 4 days.~~~Here are some info. gathered from around the internet which includes facts from this website.1. Plant is hardy in zones 7-9 and may tolerate a light frost.2. In the North, pot it for the patio or grow it as a bonsai or a houseplant.3. Loves sun.4. As a houseplant, temperatures above 50 degrees are ideal for better growth.5. It is sensitive to overwatering.6. It has the largest flowers of the gardenias and it has notable large and glossy green leaves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9R5L2ROBIKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NAHZJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2K9R5L2ROBIKG","A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the Pinwheel Jasmine Plant (Tabernaemontana divaricata) from Emerald Goddess on September 15, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on September 19.

"This African variety seems a lot easier to grow than other types of gardenias.  I have it in a container, here, in the North.  It just needs some sun and water.The fragrance is light, sweet, and clear.  I find the scent pleasant and not ""heavy"" or heady.  Its scent does not seem to fill the whole room which is in contrast to other gardenias which have stronger and heavier scents.~~~I ordered this plant on September 12, 2012 and it arrived 3 days later on September 15 from Hirt's.  The gardenia arrived healthy and looks like a tiny bush.  It came in a 4"" plastic pot and I easily repotted it to a 6"" plastic pot.It has a woody main stem which splits into three woody branches.  The height is about 11 inches.  The habit is upright with the shape similar to a tea rose bush.There is an explosion of green leaves emerging from the woody stems.  The plant has about 36 medium to dark green leaves.  The largest leaves measure about 6 inches across the length.  Many of the rest of the leaves measure about 2 to 3 inches.At the ends of the stems, it has two flower buds and two spent flower remains.  The product description indicates that this plant blooms intermittently throughout the year, so I am happy to see the two flower buds.Overall, this is a very nice plant.September 25, 2012 UpdateThe two buds are flowering.  Flowers are white, at 3 1/2"" in diameter, with a light scent.  You have to be close to the flowers to enjoy the light fragrance.The plant has been in an enclosed porch which has partial sun.  It has warm or moderate day temperatues, along with generally cool nights since it is Fall here in Rhode Island.If the plant does not get enough water, it wilts, that is, the newer growth limps or bends.  Just water it and it plumps back into a healthy and straight condition.It appears that the plant is a type which grows fast if it is in a warm and sunny area which receives plenty of water.October 12, 2012 UpdateThe two flowers went about 5 or 6 days ago.  So, under cool weather or temperatures, these 2 flowers lasted about 12 days which is fairly long.October 22, 2012 UpdateA third flower opened 2 days ago.~~~Here's how to grow it which includes info. from this website.1. Plant is hardy in zones 9-10, meaning minimum winter temps. of around 25 to 30 degrees or make it a houseplant in the North.2. Give full or partial sun.

"I was very disappointed is these cutters.  This is the first GearWrench tool that I've not thoroughly enjoyed.They will cut a 16 penny nail with a little more ease than my 8"" Cresent and Klein cutters.  The problem being because of the compound leverage design the GearWrench cutter has to be opened a full 1.5"" wider at the end of the handles which makes is almost impossible to get full strength with one hand, being that wide.  In fact I had to use 2 hands to cut the 16 penny nail.  If the GearWrench were 8"" long with handles that were more curved they would function closer to what is advertised.Plus when I cut the 16 penny nail the GearWrench cutters would bind up until I actuated them 2 or 3 times to loosen them up.  Very annoying when trying to make multiple cuts in succession.  In addition after making a dozen cuts or so the cutters had developed considerable play in the pivot points which in time will only decrease the effectiveness.  I have used my Cresent & Klein 8"" cutters for years and they are still very tight.The design looks very impressive but falls incredibly short on function.Update 9-24-14:I purchased these and they cut so easily it's almost beyond belief. They are about 3 times the price of these GearWrench pliers but they are worth every cent.

"The set I received has the newer 84 tooth ratchets, not the older 60 tooth ones shown in the picture.  This is a tremendous upgrade.  When the 84 tooth first came out they had some machining errors along with a lacking quality control but now the problems have been corrected.  I have torqued down to 60 ft. lbs with the 3/8"" ratchet and 30 ft. lbs. with the 1/4"" and not a single ratchet lock up with a dozen tries.  Locking up under tourque was the problem that people were complaining about with these 84 tooth ratchets. This appears to have been corrected but if this changes in the future I will surely upgrade my review.All of the sockets are well made and the finish and lettering is pro quality.  The only issue I noticed was the machining indent in the sockets for the ratchet ball were left rough in many cases.  After a few uses of on/off though the slight roughness disappeared.Since these are very fine tooth ratchets I would only use a light 20w or less air tool oil as a higher viscosity oil might induce tooth skipping.I see that GearWrench has some new 120 position 60 tooth ratchets available.  To me the double pawl setup looks a little low on the durability scale, with the normal size pawl effectively being split in two.  The concept is brilliant but will it produce uneven wear is my question.I could go on and on about the excellent quality.  The only other negative issue I have is about the manufacturer packaging.  They should have included some 1/2"" thick flexible foam between the lid and set so that when closed all of the components are secure.  As it was it came with about 80% of the sockets that were scattered all around at random inside the case.  Even the ratchets had dislodged.  About 10 minutes of putting them back in their positions and all is well.  But I plan on lightly attaching some foam to the lid for the future.Overall, this is a very high quality set for a reasonable price that any mechanic should find appealing.kd","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQHIMLPEPP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V5ECSK#wasThisHelpful","R1MQHIMLPEPP0","A30X4BLUOH44CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X4BLUOH44CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I spent about an hour changing batteries, taking apart to check connections, inspected circuit board, etc.  I couldn't find anything obvious so I chucked it as time is valuable to me.Since I had tried several other scales before the AWS and all were bad I tried the AWS again.  After 2 dud AWS units I tried a Smart Weigh JDS20, both of them were very erractic and to say the least not very accurate.  So I found the DBPower scale and so far its been the best of the bunch.Under 50mg it's almost always is dead on or .001g high or low.  Over 50mg up to the 30g it maintains a .002g accuracy.  I know some may not believe this, but this unit is accurate.  I plan on buying another for backup and comparison.I also like the ability to use a 250mA converter for power instead of batteries.I guess it was fate that led me to the DBPower scale.  Whatever, I'll take it as it's a wonderfully accurate scale for under $25.kd","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPV717CSLHSZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGGJUSA#wasThisHelpful","RPV717CSLHSZR","A30X4BLUOH44CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X4BLUOH44CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use scissors frequently for work and personal projects and need something that's sharp, versatile and comfortable to use and hold, even for longer periods of time. These scissors fit the bill all the things I use them for. The handles are cushioned which makes them comfortable to hold without slipping. They're not too heavy, yet solid enough that they can cut through thicker materials without tearing what I'm cutting. They're perfect for arts and crafts projects, general office purposes, opening boxes, trimming fabric or gift wrap. I can't think of anything I don't like about them and for the price, they're a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QNVMBMFQEIIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C65FOBM#wasThisHelpful","R2QNVMBMFQEIIJ","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this sunscreen after having to return the Cotz Face tinted sunscreen because it was a little too dark for my ivory complexion. It goes on very smooth and blends well. It mattifies my complexion instead of leaving it shiny like most other sunscreens I've tried tend to do. It also has a primer-like effect: makeup goes on more smoothly and pores are diminished. Though it blends well, it gives my skin a slightly lighter look because of the zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Wearing foundation over it mutes that a bit, but I'd imagine it might be more obvious on skin tones darker than mine. The tinted version of this product is called 'Natural Skin Tone'. That sunscreen has the same consistency and primer effect as this one, but some tan color is added so it's a little like wearing a foundation or tinted primer. The manufacturer told me the two versions can be mixed together if someone finds one too light and the other too dark. I don't mind the lighter look because it's very subtle and since I like to apply sunscreen to my neck, I don't want to have to worry about color transferring to my clothing. As far as sun protection, this sunscreen works great and I love that it's chemical-free. When I wear regular chemical-based sunscreens, they end up sliding down my face, especially in warm weather and leaves my eyes red and burny. I never have that problem with Cotz sunscreens which is one of the reasons I buy this brand. It's unscented, doesn't break out my skin or irritate it even though I have sensitive skin. I'm happy to have found a sunscreen that has natural protection and makes my complexion look better at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO88398G1ERG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U2Y600#wasThisHelpful","RO88398G1ERG7","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little car charger that does the job. My new smartphone is a major battery drainer, so I'd often be without a phone without this charger. It's affordable, works well, is small and portable. It has a red light so you know when it's still charging. It doesn't charge my phone quite as quickly as my phone's a/c charger and a standard outlet, but for a car charger, it's not bad at all.

"This cartridge has a rich black ink that produces professional quality printing that I've been very happy with so far, but I'm disappointed in how fast the cartridge seemed to go this time. The cartridge that came with my printer seemed to last a reasonable amount of time, but I just bought this replacement cartridge a few weeks ago, and I'm already getting low ink warnings for black ink on my printer and computer. I did print some graphics, but still, I was expecting it to last a long time like the other one. I love my Epson printer, so I'll have to deal with it, but I took a star off because it seems like either there should be more ink in a cartridge or the price should be lower.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGSWF0TROSJ4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDITZD2#wasThisHelpful","RGSWF0TROSJ4A","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the solid construction and user-friendly design of this entire car seat. It's heavy, stable and stays where you put it in your car without shifting around. The base is smooth, so it doesn't damage your car's seats. The interior fabric is soft and padded on every side. It has various shades of gray that's nice looking with my car's interior.There's an infant insert that can be taken out once the baby's over 11 pounds. The car seat has a comfortable, reclining position and good head support for the baby. Also, there's a canopy shade that can be adjusted up or down, which is good for keeping sun off the baby/child during the day.The numerous safety features and product testing makes me feel comfortable about using this for my baby. The user manual is helpful to make sure the car seat is properly installed and used. There's also a toll-free customer service hotline if you have any questions about using it.My car's fairly small, but I'm still able to fit this car seat without having to move the front seats forward.Overall, I've found this car seat to be easy to use, everything buckles in securely and the high-quality materials make me feel safer putting my baby in it. In my opinion, this car seat's worth the price for the safety features and all-around ease of use.---------------Baby/child height and weight limit: 4 to 35 pounds, 32"" tall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJ9QJNE381AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOMVAJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1KJ9QJNE381AT","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this assuming it was basic white sunscreen and received a tube labeled 'Natural Skin Tone' which I found out has a tint to it. It says it blends to a translucent shade, but my skin is light-to-medium ivory color and this is just a shade too dark for my skin color. Maybe in the summer when I get some tan it might be okay, but it just makes my face look more tan than my neck. I found out the Cotz Face sunscreen comes in white which is labeled as 'Cotz Face Lighter Skin Tone'. I'm not sure why I received the one with tint because it doesn't mention that in this product listing, but I returned it and ordered the white version. Customer service for Cotz says some people mix the tint and the white version together for a better match, but since I want something I can use on my neck too without worrying about getting tan stuff on my white clothing, the white one is better for me. It's a good product though which is why I gave it 4 stars. Very mattifying, doesn't leave the skin greasy like many sunscreens do. It blends well. Makes the skin look nice and smooth like a primer. Most people can probably get away with wearing less or maybe even no foundation when wearing this tinted sunscreen. The protection comes from Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide instead of chemical sunscreens, so it's healthier and more natural. It's water-resistant too, which is nice. The tinted version is fine if that's what you want, but if you have a light/ivory shade of skin, you might want to consider the white version for lighter skin or possibly getting both versions and mixing them together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IV64EQOMPBDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG8LKS#wasThisHelpful","R1IV64EQOMPBDZ","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these to wear in my new shearling boots which are so comfortable, but don't have much arch support. They fit into the boot perfectly and feel like they're part of them. They add some cushioning and some arch support. I'd like if they had a little more arch support than they have, but it's hard to find wool insoles which is what I prefer in the style of boots I have. So they're good for now, but if there was more arch support I'd give them 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333HLGL3DD6DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LNXMGQ#wasThisHelpful","R333HLGL3DD6DJ","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never wore this brand or style of boot before, so I ordered it in my normal shoe size of 9, which ended up being a little too small. I returned them and got a 10 which is much better. Quality and style-wise, I like them better than Uggs. I tried on some various Uggs and liked the way the Bearpaws look and feel much better. I tried on a $200 pair of Uggs and still like these more. They're super warm and cozy to wear, almost like slippers. Today it's 10 degrees out, but my feet were nice and warm. This style of boots doesn't have that much arch support and feels kind of flat to walk on despite the fleece lining, so I purchased Superfeet Merino White Insoles and they fit so well into the boot that it's like they're part of them. The insoles add a little more cushioning and support so if you walk alot, they're more comfortable. It's still not lots of arch support, but it's definitely better than without them. It also a good idea to spray these boots with a water repellent spray for suede products prior to wearing them so they're easier to clean and repel dirt. I want to keep my boots clean so I try to avoid wearing them on extremely wet or slushy wet-snow days. Once I got the correct size, I'm extremely happy with these boots and am so glad I got Bearpaw instead of another brand. They're a good value for comfortable, high-quality boots. 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MFAU14YH5UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AT6ARS0#wasThisHelpful","R11MFAU14YH5UJ","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book will definitely make you stop and contemplate how you live your life, how you spend your time, your money and your energy. It's a subtle wake-up call and reminder about what changes anyone can easily make every day to improve themselves, which will in turn improve the quality and experience of their life. There's such a broad range of topics covered in this book, that I think just about everyone will find relevant lessons and learn ways to cut out anything that's weighing them down in one way or another.

"I found this book to be a very enjoyable and inspiring read. It's somewhat of an autobiography of author Christina Stevens rather than just a book about meeting Mother Theresa. Stevens takes us along on a journey that began with a vision about meeting Mother Theresa. The quest isn't easy and the route is filled with setbacks and obstacles, but Stevens doesn't give up hope. The chapters are filled with interesting stories and unique and colorful people that the author knows, works with or encounters during this time. It's a book about following the dream in your heart despite naysayers and the powerful transformation that can come from that. Very worthwhile read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OVK7JIX9ZPH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945910#wasThisHelpful","R1OVK7JIX9ZPH3","A235UFZGCFN3J5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A235UFZGCFN3J5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
