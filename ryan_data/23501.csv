"Neat little device, as an over 50 male I find affirmation in the readings I have taken on myself (MQ 115-fat % 14.9) quite reassuring.If you are an iPad owner the Skulpt App is an essential tool to make this device work.In the app are instructions on how to use the device including instructions as to where to place the device for each muscle reading.Follow the instructions, take all of the measurements then sync with your iPad.You can easily track your fitness progress.It does what it says and appears to be fairly accurate/consistent. After a month the readings are within what I expected.I will skip the Pros as it is pretty self explanatory what and how it does what it does.Cons:First and foremost the charger is atrocious, there is no power indicator to tell you whether it is charging or not, you have to hit the power  button when it is seated precariously in the charger and look at the screen to tell. This is a necessary step as often it doesn't seat and doesn't charge. The fitment between the device and the charger isn't a positive thing it just sort of balances there. For the money they could have spent a little more and put a small extension on the charger to situate the device more firmly in it's seat.  And adding a simple LED indicator on the charger to show you whether or not it is charging is a no-brainer.Second the battery life during storage is very short, if you plan on taking it on a trip bring the charger. I fully charged it, put it in its nice little storage bag and a week later it was 95% discharged.Third if you have body hair the little water spray bottle wont last through one measuring session, in my case it takes 3 trips to the sink to complete one session.Forth, the App itself is buggy, I had to close it and open it several times due to it hanging up between screens.But all in alll it has potential, perhaps in its next revision the few bugs will be worked out and I would consider 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7782LBTC3HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2SWMUI#wasThisHelpful","R1R7782LBTC3HF","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used these one cup cubes for many many years and they are by far the best tasting boullion cubes. I have tried every other brand and they are not the same. Many are greasy and don't dilute well or they are just salty with not much flavor. These are the best by far, they are flavorful, they crumble and dilute easily and are not greasy.

"I tried this product Hoping to lesson pre menopausal symptoms I was having. I am 51 soon to be 52 and I have been suffering with extreme joint pain that moves around during my cycle as well as horrible migraines, exhaustion and depression. I tried taking just one of the three teaspoons recommended and I got a headache and terrible indigestion right away. After a couple days I slightly increased to 1.5 t and after two hours felt like I was going to be sick. I raced home and barely made it to the bathroom. I experienced severe vomiting and diarrhea for three straight hours. I puked so hard I threw my back out and spent the next day in bed feeling like crap and got the worse migraine ever. This product is clearly not for everyone so be cautious and do your research, it is not FDA approved for whatever thats worth. Others have reported disturbing symptoms as well, see below link. From my personal experience, I can't recommend this, nothing good for you should make you that violently sick.http://herbs.lovetoknow.com/Maca_Root_Side_Effects","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKW1L97HCNT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A0PB7O#wasThisHelpful","R1XKW1L97HCNT4","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lite is just OK. It is not very bright for most applications and the light color is very blue white which seems to make it harder to see then my other more white light LED lights. The sensor works good, it comes on from a good distance away aprox. 6 feet. The light tends to flicker which I also did not like. If you switch the auto setting off and go back to auto it takes a while for it to come on again, odd quark. This will not be enough light for a 10x10 pantry full of shelves but it is ok in small dark spaces. I think this is best used low to the ground like in a guest bathroom or dark hall so guests don't kill themselves at night and don't have to wake you up turning bright lights on, so it has it's purpose. Not sure how long the three batteries will last, In my experience with these kinds of lights and we have had many, the batteries don't last very long and never seem to get replaced. A rechargable one you could plug in to charge would be much better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNTC7S8Z15XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7JX7ZU#wasThisHelpful","R3QNTC7S8Z15XH","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me this necklace is way to fragile and thin for an adult, it is more like something a child would wear. The clasp is so teeny I couldn't even put it on. When I tried to clasp it in my hands and not on my neck it was still very hard to do and it did not quite line up, the clasp stayed a little open till I forced it all the way closed. The chain can't be more then 8 strands of hair thick, you can bareley see it on. The pendant is cute still feather light but sparkly and pretty and appears to be well made, not so thin to be bendable. Would be much nicer on a better chain with a normal size clasp. This is for a VERY petite Mom for sure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GREUQBS9AXDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0U6P7I#wasThisHelpful","R2GREUQBS9AXDW","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the selling price there isn't much more that could be expected out of this little grooming tool.Pros:LightweightWashable headsSingle batterySmall razor head effective for light touchup here and there it is obviously not meant for a full shave.Cons:LoudThe trimmer blade heads could use a couple,of,different options for hair length. For me it was either too long or too short, I gave my eyebrows a crew cut.....One other head option that should really have been included would have been and ear/nose hair trimmer.The motor seems a little weak compared to other trimmers I have used, (Mangroomer wins so far) I think the motor will have a short life but 30 days isn't really long enough to tell.At the price level for this item the addition of the different hair length trimmer heads and the ear/nose head would have pushed it into 5 star territory.A simple little unit but it is not a stand alone product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RF95PNFVFHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSKFS#wasThisHelpful","R12RF95PNFVFHH","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well Featured headset. I use BT daily in my profession. this headset works perfectly.iPhone 6Pros:Incoming call announce, uses names from your address book or incoming numberhandsfree answer/ignore. Simply say ""Answer"" to ""Ignore"" during an incoming call and it will either connect or go to voicemail.One button Siri access. Google, maps, etc. works flawlesslyOne button iMessage/texting. This is a great help. simply hit one button and say ""Read Message/s"" or ""Send Message"" and Siri will take over and send/receive without having to look at or touch the phone.Siri even does her best to describe Emojis when they are sent which can be pretty comical  ""wink face with smile"" LOL.Cons:This is the most uncomfortable headset I have had in years!  I can't get it to stay in without the over the ear clip. And when using that is pushes it into my ear hard enough I can only take about 2 hours and I have to swap ears, by the end of the 1st day it was out of my ear and back in my car.After a days attempt at using it My ears are actually bruised.There are many ear buds in the package but closer examination reveals there are really only 2 styles, some are black and some orange. Same design just different colors to go with? Wardrobe? Hair Color?I wish it fit better, but with the lack of a comfortable wearing option this one is going back.I am no novice to BT headsets and have been using them pretty much since they came out.I normally use the Motorola Command One but it is out of production and when I find them still on Amazon or the ""bay I order 3 at a time and MIGHT get one that works.Still searching....","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12B4SRMHU0XLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSYHLR2#wasThisHelpful","R12B4SRMHU0XLJ","A2MSQNPTNAAGL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSQNPTNAAGL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was just OK to me. It is not cost effective because it is so watery. when you apply a liberal amount to a wash cloth it seems to disappear instantly and you have to keep using more and more to get any form of lather.

"Yes - they're only 4 ""sprigs"" of elodia - but it's increasingly hard to find as it is classified as an aquatic invasive, closely related to the dreaded hydrilla. But if you are a moral and just person, you can keep some in a warm, well-illuminated tank and propagate it for years to come. (Just don't flush it, or put it into a drain - dry it out and trash it).  Don't be concerned with shipment - my sprigs arrived in good shape - I placed them in pond water in a small tank in a greenhouse, and within hours there were little oxygen bubbles emerging from the photosynthesizing leaves.There's nothing like elodia to demonstrate plasmolysis to students, is there?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0GDSGM9Y1XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V313QW4#wasThisHelpful","R3C0GDSGM9Y1XL","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now that the larger box cited by the lead reviewer has become much more dear, this smaller box provides a much more economical alternative for music lovers who want an overview of Menuhin's artistry. As noted, you get most of the famous ""big"" concertos with the exception of Tchaikovsky, which may be a deal breaker for some listeners. On the other hand, you will not be spending an exorbitant amount of money for a large box containing many historic recordings of violin bon-mots, and chamber works better performed by others (viz., Beethoven Sonatas)Still, it must be said, that classical music lovers seeking a one-stop overview of the violin repertoire would probably be better served by seeking out Oistrakh's box on EMI David Oistrakh: The Complete EMI Recordings which offers a broader scope, more music, and more consistent musicianship at about the same price point.Still, it's a nice box to complement others on the shelf.

"This is a large, heavy, substantial watch. That's great if, like the first reviewer, you have large wrists - but if you don't, you're gonna be shlepping a lot of horologe around. It's not thin - the watch alone has a thickness of 3/4 of an inch. How thick is that? I was able to stack 10 CDs on a tabletop right next to the watch. Ten.That said - it is a rather elegant design, as the initial reviewer pointed out. (I don't believe he emphasized the beauty of the transparent case - both front and back - revealing the inner old-fashioned mechanism of the watch).One extremely frustrating aspect is that the band has a clasp design that was virtually impossible to figure out. I've owned clasp band watches - most latch open easily, and then ""snap"" shut, keeping the watch on your wrist. This one doesn't. The pin that goes into the band holes is in an upright ""closed position"", necessitating to open the hinged top with amy finger nail, re-latching it, positioning the belt buckle in place, and latching the clasp. Putting the darn watch on was an extremely frustrating experience.  It take a lot of pulling, angling, pivoting, and clasping to figure the darn thing out.  This represents a serious design flaw. Never in my life have I seen a design like this. And I have a masters degree in science.And it's not merely frustrating - the band is uncomfortable.Don't be fooled by the lead Amazon description of Lucien Piccard on this page - there aren't any gemstones on this watch at this price point (don't be fooled by the alleged ""list price""). No diamonds, no sapphires - just blue micro-screws holding the front plate on to the under assembly. The overall design is elegant, and I imagine that it would be complemented for its appearance.If I can ever get the darn thing on my wrist. Frankly, I don't anticipate wearing this watch - despite the fact that I got a free review sample. Putting on a wristwatch in the age of the iWatch should not be this frustrating.UPDATE 11/7/15 -  Having lived with this watch for a couple of weeks now, I'm deducting a star and bringing the rating down to 2 stars. Unfortunately - again - it has to do with the watch band, rather than the watch. It is simply awful - it has spontaneously opened and released the watch on two occasions (fortunately, onto a soft surface - no damage!). But I also dread putting the watch on and ""fighting"" with the clasp. It's become unbearably unpleasant.UPDATE 11/12/15 - the youtube video linked in the comments section below provided good instructions for clasping the band. The NEED for this video, however, just illustrates how non-intuitive this design is. Having successfully locked the watch in place, I anticipate wearing it more frequently! Which is good - it is very attractive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIHCELA3PXPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXMVZ6#wasThisHelpful","R3MIHCELA3PXPK","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this heater - just love it!Here in New England the evening chill is setting in - already down to the 30s. Not cold enough to start the wood stove, and I'm too cheap to start turning on the furnace. We heat individual rooms with a variety of heaters, including oil filled radiator DeLongie types, as well as the previous favorite the Lifesmart Large Room 6 Element Infrared Heater. Vornado wins - hands down.From the moment you open the box, you know that you have yet another quality Vornado product (I have previously owned their fans). The packaging is superb, offering great protection for this well-designed, colorful unit, Second, you immediately see a reassuring message on the inner box lid that Vornado ""wants this product to be PERFECT"" (their caps) and ""if it's not WE will make it right"". When was the last time you read something like that? It's designed and engineered in the US - but, alas, it is Made In China. As Thomas Friedman has said, the world is flat.Once out of the package, and the protective coverings are removed, you are looking at one well designed little unit. Simply plug it in, press the on switch, select your temperature setting and fan speed (low/high) and a warm, SILENT breeze emerges from the heater. It's really delightful. As quiet as a fan can be, and no ""oil filled"" order, no ""red element glow"" like the infra red - just a warm steady breeze that warmed our 12-x15 test room with no problem.It's strengths are that it is well designed, guaranteed for 5 years (!), virtually silent, odor free, cool on the outside regardless how long it was on, and has a safety switch on the bottom that turns the unit off if it should tip over.Are there negatives? At this early point, I don't see any. I've put the oil filled radiator in the closet (I've always hated its odor) and have no regrets. My wife enjoys its near silence - both the fact that its quiet, but also that it has the slightest sound of fan-whirl that produces calming sleep-inducing background sound. Again - it's virtually silent. This is not table fan loud. It's really great.Definately impressed, and pleased. It will get regular use in our home, while we sleep, and save money in the process.Well done Vornado! 5-stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5VKB805NSW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVIOFNG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q5VKB805NSW1","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess that I have had a very different experience with this lens than the lead reviewer.That lead review kept me away from purchasing this lens for quite some time. As the standard 4/3 format begins to wither and fade, zuiko lenses have dropped in price and it was possible to purchase this 18-180 zoom for $100 (!). So I thought - what the heck? For that price, how could I go wrong.Needn't have worried, This lens has proven to be an excellent ""walkabout lens"". It may not be as crystalline sharp as the 12-60 (still my favorite Zuiko lens, along with the 50mm macro) but take a look at these two images taken recently. Couldn't have been more pleased. I've enlarged images to 16x20 and have seen none of the deficiencies outlined in the lead reviews. (If you zoom in on the red maple leaves - an image already cropped - you can still see the silk threads of a web near the top right leaf).So, I'd suggest not hesitating if you're considering this lens if you can purchase it for 150-200. True, it's not the fastest lens, but if you shoot aperture priority 5.6-8 you really shouldn't have any problem. And it's a heck of a lot cheaper than the 50-200 ED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHRYBDRQ48AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BTFZMS#wasThisHelpful","RNHRYBDRQ48AR","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've loved this album ever since it's initial release. Given the critical drubbing it received (by friends as well as professional writers) it has always remained something of a guilty pleasure. But re-assessing it now, in its latest re-mastered incarnation, I don't think that Pipes Of Peace requires any apology. It is an immensely enjoyable disc. And now, in its remastered edition, it's better sounding than ever before.The title cut, McCartney's personal response to Tug Of War (""in love our problems disappear"" - the melody of the intro alone is something to cherish) displays McCartney's melodic gifts as well as his seemingly effortless ability to pull catchy ear worm melodies out of the air (thinking now of those pipes and drums). While the lyrics still evoke a bit of a wince (""Help me to learn/songs of joy/instead of Burn, Baby, Burn"" - ouch) the joyful spirit of the song prevails. In 2015 the message seems more apropos pos than ever before, and truthfully, the song itself seems less labored than McCartney's more recent efforts (Hope for The future, and Love Song To The Earth)What's different is the extraordinarily clear remastering, revealing sound textures and layers never before appreciated. The tablas! The flutes! The early electronics! Listening to this album on a pair of high-end cans is a wonderful experience.The Michael Jackson collaborations range from excellent pop (Say, Say, Say) to the dreadful (The Man - an album low point) Similarly, it needs to be acknowledged that Tug Of Peace is a bit of an enjoyable throw away as is Hey, Hey) Average Person is delightful - one of McCartney's ruminations about typical Joes living the average life he is about as far away from as possible. Similar in theme to both Penny Lane and On My Way To Work from the recent and arguably stronger album ""New"", Average Person is a bouncy, jaunty ode to an anonymous engine driver, a waitress, and a boxer. It's a minor theme, but McCartney bestows dignity on those folks - they were here today -  by making them the focus of his song.The bottom line is that McCartney has always been blessed, and cursed with a ridiculous amount of musical talent(s). Such excess may lead to greatness ('buff said about that) or mediocrity. On Pipes of Peace, even the mediocrity remains catchy and enjoyable. It's the heights that truly soar.In the case of Pipes Of Peace, the unquestioned heights are So Bad and Through Our Love. The former is an absolutely gorgeous pop ballad. I know a previous reviewer didn't hear it this way, but really - it's just one of those perfect pop melodies that McCartney creates by pulling melodic strings out of the air. Once heard, it is not forgotten. I'm prepared to call it a perfect pop song - a masterful composition. And oh, that simple melodic baseline. Pure Macca.Through Our Love, another McCartney ode to Linda, is simply beautiful. Perhaps not as perfect, not quite as unforced as So Bad, it remains none the less, a memorable love song that any of us should sing to our beloved on a special occasion. (Well, if we could sing like Paul. If only.) It is the type of song no longer being sung in this age of hard edged, cynical, angry pop music. Another song that benefits from the wonderful remastering. The production is an all out George Martin aural-gasm.Between the highs and lows you have perfectly serviceable songs that are fun, buoyant, and catchy. Pure McCartney. And at this point in time, you either enjoy him or your don't. My guess is that you're reading this review, you do. Folks may think of them as  silly love songs, but McCartney has always wanted to change the world with them. And in the long run - who has proven correct?As I've said in other contexts: God Bless Sir Paul McCartney. If you've ever attended a McCartney summer concert, you know just how special a musician and performer he is. to see and hear 50,000 people, whose ages range from 6 to 80 , smiling and singing along with him - I mean what can be said? Who else can do this? Whose songs are as beloved or well-known?Which other performer has brought as much joy, to as many people, all over the world during the past half century as Paul McCartney has?The answer, obviously, is no one. So cut him some slack. Pipes of Peace is not a masterpiece, but it's quite enjoyable. It harkens back to an easier time, and calls to the best in each of us. It documents McCartney's reaching out to a newly emerging star (Jackson) only to have the latter turn around later and stab him in the back (by purchasing the Beatles' catalogue out from under him)  And still, McCartney sings songs of love and peace. And now, they sound better than ever before.The day that there are no new Paul McCartney songs to listen to will be a sad day indeed. Cherish each one.Carpe McCartney.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3000PYL6FMLBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BXMZIS#wasThisHelpful","R3000PYL6FMLBJ","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you do not have many recordings by Richter - certainly one of the titans of the 20th century - this is a wonderfully affordable introductory collection. Or, perhaps you have some of these recordings but couldn't be tempted to start another shelf of Richter CDs for performances that aren't quite top-tier Richter. In either case, this box set - at this price point -  can only be considered an embarrassment of riches for all those who admire and respect the artistry of Sviatoslav Richter.The DG recordings in particular are almost all classics. The Decca and Philips recordings are more hit and miss, containing fine pianism, but fewer of those magical ""Richter moments"" that collectors salivate over. Some are merely good (Richter never really got Mozart) Most are very good (Beethoven/Schumann - other SR performances excel), some excellent (Liszt, Handel, Haydn, Schubert, Bach, the chamber music, the 20th century music)). The justly acclaimed Philips recordings of the Beethoven Sonatas with Rostropovich contain many sublime moments from each musician, and deserve their classic performance status, as does Disc 34 containing the legendary Sophia recital.  Collecting other Richter moments on individual discs on other labels such as Praga, Orfeo, BBC Legends, DoReMi etc come at a steep price. This box set may serve as the foundation for further explorations, or as a worthy supplement to provide a more complete picture of the work of this extraordinary musician.For those interested in a broad overview of this pianists work, this is a solid investment. The recorded sound is generally the finest that Richter had, esp. on the Decca/Philips discs. The cardboard sleeves seem a tad thinner than usual, and its typically inconvenient to need to turn each sleeve's back to the front in order to flip through and see the actual contents rather than the disc number. The flip-lid style box is the sturdiest design I've seen for these boxes - much better than the half-tops that lift off.For those who are interested in fewer discs, but a generally higher level of musicianship - although recorded with significantly lower fidelity -  I suggest holding out a bit longer for the release of the 18 discs RCA set which will contain Richter's legendary Carnegie Hall performances as well as his legendary Brahms PC 2 with Leinsdorf Complete Album Collection.Better yet, purchase both! Here's what comes in this box:THE SET:-The performances in this set cover a wide range of Richter's large repertoire, spanning nearly four decades from 1956 to 1992 that include performances of solo recitals,  concertos, chamber music collaborations and even as Lieder accompanist (Schubert's Winterreise with tenor Peter Schreier).-A lid-off style box containing 49 CDs divided into 3 categories: Solo, Chamber and Concerto Recordings-2 Bonus CDs containing a celebrated recording of Richter and Britten performing works by Schubert. (These are excellent!)-A booklet in English, French and German including photos and an essay by Jed Distler.CONTENTS:THE SOLO RECORDINGSCDs 1-3 J.S.

"If you are considering this disc, you are no doubt familiar with the work of Arvo Part. Presumably, you have seen this listing as a result of your familiarity with other Part works, like Fratres, Tabula Rasa or the hauntingly beautiful Spiegel Mit Spiegel. If you are, you have probably come to these works through the exemplary singing of the Hilliard Ensemble who have established a very high bar indeed when it comes to Part performance.Polyphony meets, and perhaps exceeds that high standard, on this - their third disc containing music of Arvo Part. The vocal blend of this ensemble, under the direction of Stephen Layton, is extraordinary. Complemented by the state of the art recording provided by Hyperion, this is a treasure of a disc.The selections include many lesser known works composed between 1963 and 2012, each ""delightfully fresh and translucently textured"" as noted in the well written booklet. This is a disc of classic Part - simple, yet profoundly moving. Melodic and accessible. Music that touches the heart and soul. The standout for me is Solfeggio, from 1963. Upon my initial hearing of the piece, I got up and noted which track was playing so I could note it in this review.  Solfeggio is the earliest piece on the disc, and belies the notion that early Part is characterized atonal cacophony. This piercingly beautiful piece features voices singing the notes of the scale rather than words - each entry shining down like a ray of light from the celestial heavens. Truly, breathtakingly beautiful.Strongly recommended - for fans of of Part, fans of choral music, and fans of Polyphony (of which I am one! For more holiday/seasonal fare, check out their beautiful disc of John Rutter's Christmas Music: Rutter: Music for Christmas )","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MT3GHPULRLRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MX51H3E#wasThisHelpful","R1MT3GHPULRLRG","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having had good luck with other Honeywell air products including humidifiers and air cleaners, I was looking forward to using this little unit in my office. Alas - it was not to be. This cute little unobtrusive unit revealed problems right from its initial use.I've experience other small cool mist humidifiers, I was aware of their relative drawback (a small mist stream, a need for distilled water, as well as a need for frequent cleaning/disinfecting to eliminate bacteria and to keep the vibrating membrane clean).I did not however, expect immediate problems the first night I used the humidifier. Things started off great - the attractive unit was quiet, produced a great variable stream of mist, and was really quite silent. Unfortunately, at 3 AM that night (!) the fan began buzzing. I tried to ignore it, but within minutes, the volume became intolerable. The tank was full. I tried removing and re-seating the tank. I slapped the motor unit. I tried jostling the unit. Everything. Nothing worked. The fan is quite loud, making this unit unusable.Perhaps this could have been an isolated incident, but unfortunately, this is the same problem experience by the lead reviewer for this unit, suggesting a quality control issue. This - along with a detachable O-ring washer which if not seated properly results in slight leaks - makes this an unacceptable humidifier.Note that this is not a true Honeywell product. The box and manual both state that this unit is manufactured by KAZ industries under license for use of the Honeywell trademark. Honeywell can, and should,  do better. I actually had to throw this unit out.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9C4HV139FPMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWA7GWA#wasThisHelpful","R9C4HV139FPMW","A24IBBUZIHTPRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24IBBUZIHTPRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You pretty much know what you're getting with this assortment, reviews or no reviews. So I'll try to focus on things that might not be obvious. First, be clear that the packages inside here are the Halloween-sized mini candies. The Almond Joy, for example, contains one bar and one almond. The Reese's contains one peanut-butter cup. OK, that part was probably obvious, but I thought it worth mentioning just in case.So the box is ideal for Halloween, and one nice feature is the box itself, which is sturdy enough to prevent crushed candy. There's little chance of getting flattened peanut-butter cups when you open this. Beyond that, the only feature to consider, I think, is the price, but since prices change, sometimes dramatically, I am not factoring them into this review. What you get for your money is about three pounds of quality candies in a box that will keep them safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLOB2TE0QFVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CFGPQI#wasThisHelpful","R3KLOB2TE0QFVG","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One box of this litter is enough for two standard-sized litter boxes. The box itself is difficult to open (in that it requires some strength to tear open the top flap), but the litter pours easily enough once the box is open. Six cats had no trouble adjusting to this litter from standard, non-clumping clay litter. I did notice little pieces of wood tracked about the house though.As for its ability to mask odor, I found that overall, it does a good job, though when the first cat used it, there was a noticeable odor of feces. That odor persisted for only a few minutes. The clumping ability is fairly good, making it easy to transport clumps from the litter box to the toilet or trash. (I like that this product is flushable and biodegradable.)The biggest factor for me is the cost, something I generally try to ignore in reviews since prices can fluctuate dramatically, but I will say that at the current price, this litter would cost hundreds of dollars for my six cats over the course of a year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTD3T5MM5TT06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0OVSXO#wasThisHelpful","RTD3T5MM5TT06","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Many of her evenings involve dealing with a variety of customers, from a man with obvious psychological difficulties to underage teens to a man who is silent until she speaks, at which point he interrupts her to complain. When she is not at the store, she engages in a variety of hookups with men and women (hence the title, though I should note that the title also refers to the fact that she dresses up in various costumes as part of her job).The movie is more a character study than a plot-driven film. What plot there is involves Mason, a pre-op transsexual who seems to be everything that Emma desires. As the back of the box says, he might be ""her knight in shining armor."" But Emma's existence throughout the film seems predicated on revealing as little of herself to others as is possible and lying about herself in order to facilitate her hookups. With Mason, it appears that this approach might doom Emma's chances at happiness.I liked the film for a few reasons. One is that despite the prominence of the work setting (i.e., the adult store), the film does not devolve into salaciousness or prurient exploitation. That's not to say that there aren't adult themes or moments that parents would want to shield younger viewers from; there are, of course. But the film itself is serious and is not about exploitation or titillation. I also thought that the acting was generally quite good. Shields herself exhibits surprising personality for someone who spends about half the film trudging through the mundane life she lives. Her ennui is convincing, but when she does have the chance to show emotion, she does so well. Finally, I really liked the way that Emma responds to Mason's revelation about his status as a pre-op transsexual.There is one more thing to note, and it involves the ending of the film. I won't give away anything, but I will note that Little Bi Peep is self-reflexive. In other words, it knows that it's a movie, and it references that fact. To me, that bit worked. For others, however, it might be frustrating, as if the world of the film is suddenly shown to be fictional and the viewers' investment in it therefore tainted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VR9AUN2DBRDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CG2EM8#wasThisHelpful","R1VR9AUN2DBRDL","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed was the scent, which is hard to describe. It was decidedly pleasant and not at all like that of a perfume. I really wish I had a greater command of the language to convey the scent with greater specificity, but I will add that it was somewhat spicy. As for the product's effectiveness, I can't say that it outperformed other shaving creams (or even ordinary soap). It seemed to be, in that respect, pretty much the same as even the dollar shave creams for the most part. There was, however, one significant difference. The AHAVA cream did not come close to stinging or even causing the least bit of discomfort during a second shave of the throat. That discovery was most welcome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCD3VTMA5SKXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KE40EQ#wasThisHelpful","RCD3VTMA5SKXS","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early in the summer, I used Frontline Plus on six cats. It did the trick, but toward the end of the summer, I noticed a flea or two on a couple of the cats. So I tried this product, and I have not seen fleas since. As instructed, I applied the medicine right between the shoulder blades (same as with Frontline Plus), and the cats responded well to it. They've adjusted.I'd give this product five stars, but I can't be certain of the product's efficacy. Certainly, I have absolutely no evidence that it did not work. But I can't be certain that it did. As I said, I noticed only a few fleas. That I haven't seen any since may be because there was no real problem to begin with but might be because the product really worked.

"As with all of the ""Best American"" books, there are hits and misses in this offering, and which articles are hits and which misses is an entirely subjective assessment. I can say that I enjoyed the vast majority of the pieces in this work.When it comes to sports writing, I like the articles that go beyond who did what, that probe the personalities behind the stories, that raise sport in general to a higher level, one that can reflect and, indeed, shape humanity. Perhaps the best story in this category from this book is ""Haverford Hoops,"" about the Haverford College basketball team during the early 1990s. If you've never heard of Haverford--or have heard of Haverford but wonder why it might be included in an anthology of spots writing--, you're no doubt not alone. Haverford (which, in the interest of disclosure, I'll note was my undergraduate school) is a small, liberal-arts school just outside Philadelphia. In athletics, it plays in division III. In the early '90s, though, it might be more accurate to say that the Haverford basketball team played the doormat for the rest of the teams in the division.""Haverford Hoops,"" by Chris Ballard, profiles the impressive winless streak that the team amassed as it threatened the record at the time. It is a story about people who realistically had essentially no hope, not even a distant one, of becoming professional athletes. It is a story about people who went on to become doctors and lawyers. And it is a story about a naively optimistic coach. But what makes the story work is the writing.There are 21 articles in this book, and all have something to recommend them. ""Haverford Hoops"" stands out for me, but I'd also recommend ""One Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty-Eight Pounds of Sons,"" ""The Two Michael Sams,"" ""Precious Memories,"" and ""Sins of the Preacher"" as being especially noteworthy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VCRWLRYA2BFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544340051#wasThisHelpful","R3VCRWLRYA2BFS","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't all that much to say about a t-shirt, but I'll say what I can. First, the fit was slightly small for the size indicated. So those on the borderline between two different sizes might want to get the larger size. A related point is that the shirt is not that long. Other t-shirts I have in the same size extend lower. This one ends pretty much at belt level. Second, the shirt is soft and comfortable, even right out of the package. So far, the collar hasn't curled, and the shirt did not demonstrate any shrinking out of the wash. I like it, but it's not miles above generic t-shirts. As far as I'm concerned, it's just another shirt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315MKG4NEUDB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXITHPS#wasThisHelpful","R315MKG4NEUDB2","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's what I absolutely do NOT look for when I read a book about faith: an author who agrees with me on everything. Reading such an author would be a waste of time. I could, far more quickly, look in the mirror and tell the image I see how wonderful it is. What I look for is new insights, new ways of looking at things, and opinions and arguments that force me to grow, either by expanding my consideration or by mustering up a solid basis to maintain my views.""Gifts of the Dark Wood"" has a great deal that I don't agree with (and, to be fair, much that I do). For example, the author quotes Forrest Church (a person, not a building or congregation) as having great insight about us by stating, among other things,  ""However successful you are, you fail in ways that matter both to you and to your loved ones.  ""Beyond all this, your life is stressful, your happiness fleeting, your health insecure.  ""You worry about aging.  ""You sometimes worry about dying.""(The list of statements is much longer.) The author then asks, ""How does Forrest Church know us so well? Because Forrest Church knew himself so well."" No, I think. I see nothing more than the basic statements that are part of any cold reading offered by a ""psychic,"" the vague generalities that everyone will agree with, to one degree or another. If the book is for ""soulful skeptics,"" as the cover claims, I would think that many of them would wonder whether Church has any real insight at all here.That said, there is, I think, a fair amount of value here. If I am to condense the book's thesis to a single sentence (a risky proposition to be sure), it would be that our worst moments can be the catalyst to much greater things. To some extent, faith figures into this process, but I'm not really sure what the faith is that the book advocates. Author Eric Elnes spends a fair amount of time talking about Jesus, but the book labels itself ""A guidebook for spirituality in a post-Christian world."" Perhaps for some, this is just the right kind of book. I have a friend who considers herself deeply Christian and believes firmly in reincarnation. So maybe theologically we are moving in a postmodern directions. And I don't believe that one necessarily must adhere strictly and absolutely to a single, historical orthodoxy. So I'm inclined to agree with fellow reviewer Michael Wood that the book is ""best suited for those on either extreme of the faith continuum.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MN1AUXTXK52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426794134#wasThisHelpful","R33MN1AUXTXK52","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. This product has several flaws, most notably the means of turning it on and off. (You put on the lid and twist it.) However, in the quest for brilliantly slushy ice, I was willing to overlook that problem. Besides, once I figured it out, it wasn't all that much of an obstacle. My experience, however, did not produce the slushiness I wanted. I was hoping for something that felt smooth. Ideally, I planned to make piña coladas with uniform consistency. Alas, the ice, while crushed, was not made that smooth.I agree, too, with the reviewers' complaints about the lack of sturdiness of this product. The thing just doesn't feel all that sturdy.

"I’ve read literally hundreds of collections of short stories, and very often, I find that the stories are just small versions of novels. Joy Castro, however, shows why short stories are not just little novels but are a genre unto themselves. If you are looking for stories with beginnings, middles, and ends, you probably won’t like much of what you find in this collection of 28 stories, some as short as two pages and none longer than 18. Some of the stories in this collection might be better described as vignettes or tableaux than stories. But if you are looking for deft portrayals of complex characters in a wide variety of situations, you should be, as I was, delighted by most of the stories here.Castro takes the short-story form seriously and uses its flexibility fearlessly. The title story, for instance, is told backward. Another story (I won’t say which) depends heavily on its title for context: change the title, and you have a completely different story. In other words, these aren’t pithy little tales. They are carefully crafted stories that resist quick consumption. I spent a good 20 minutes on one story, compulsively reading and rereading to try to find as much meaning as I could and admire the craft as much as possible.If there is a theme to this book, it exists in the overlap of gender and ethnicity, with special emphasis on the former. But I think it’s probably better to focus on the quality, which is superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKT6JKBELN9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803276605#wasThisHelpful","R3HKT6JKBELN9O","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways, Don’t Touch is just another YA story about love between two people, at least one of whom has a serious disability. In this case, it is Cassie, who suffers panic attacks whenever she is touched. And yet, she is drawn to Peter, whom she wants to--but cannot bring herself--to touch. He respects her situation but also wants more. So in many respects, there is not much new here. But there is a recurrent--and explicit--set of references to Hamlet here, from quotations before the chapters (or “acts” as they’re called here) to the school play to Caddie’s feeling of deep kinship with Ophelia from the play.So it’s hard to assess this book for me. I’m intimately familiar with the play, having both read and taught it, and I am thus aware that I have more knowledge of it than the average YA reader will. I see at times the author’s sometimes excessive efforts to create parallels between the stories, but I also see the times in which these efforts succeed, especially in exploring the character of Ophelia.So instead, I’ll do my best to ignore the ties to Hamlet and assess the book as a contemporary story about contemporary characters. The two main characters are well drawn and seem realistic. Their relationship is effective, and the portrayal of Caddie’s manifestation of OCD seems sympathetic and realistic, especially as the novel is told from Caddie’s point of view. I suspect that the book will resonate well with teens, especially those who see themselves as different or as outcasts. As Caddie is drawn to Ophelia, so might readers be drawn to Caddie. And if Don’t Touch inspires a few readers to explore Hamlet, all the better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW7KS6R88C1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220934#wasThisHelpful","REW7KS6R88C1E","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not read any of the previous novels in the series Smashed is a part of, but I did not get the sense that I was missing anything vital. It did seem clear that the characters, especially investigators Jim Snow and Alice James, have pasts that have been developed in previous books, but that’s to be expected.The pair is hired to investigate the murder of a gambler. Their client is the dead man’s ex-girlfriend, and she is probably the most interesting thing in the book, spectacularly inconsistent and unreliable. There’s also a hit-and-run that appears to be related to the murder.I can’t say that the mystery is all that compelling as the book seems to be more about action and mood. Having been to Las Vegas many times, I did enjoy the setting of the book, which goes beyond just the Strip with which everyone is familiar. And the book did pass the time, but I can’t say that I’ll remember it in a month. So my recommendation is qualified. I’d suggest the book as a quick diversion.

"Silence Once Begun is the second of two Jesse Ball novels I’ve read in the past month, and it’s the better of the two. Or perhaps I should say the one I enjoyed more. The premise is fascinating. An innocent man confesses to a notoriously unsolved crime involving multiple deaths. We know he’s innocent, and to some degree we understand why he confesses. He does so because of a bar bet he lost. (Yeah, that’s clear enough.) He is ultimately convicted, sentenced, and executed. OK, simple enough so far.After his wife stops speaking to him, a journalist becomes interested in the case above. After all, after his confession, Oda Sotatsu remains silent up until his execution. So the journalist is drawn to the issue of silence here and interviews many who knew the executed man. And what emerges is a welter of contradictory information. Even the man’s family can’t seem to agree on who he was. In other words, we have Rashomon except that the characters here can’t agree on the person (as opposed to the events in the film and the stories that spawned it).Oh, and for fun, let’s add one more wrinkle to the mix. The author’s name is Jesse Ball. The journalist’s name is Jesse Ball.The style is spare, poetic, occasionally profound, and often cryptic. Silence Once Begun seems to provide few answers but raise many questions. In other words, this is a book to ponder. And it’s generally a pretty good one at that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZ0C9UB2PK9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908488#wasThisHelpful","R3SZ0C9UB2PK9C","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ballad of a Small Player is about Lord Doyle, on the run after theft, and his time in the casinos of Macau, where he plays baccarat and sinks deeper and deeper into his gambling addiction. The book is also profoundly depressing (which probably is a strength since that depression seems to come from realism). Comparisons to James Bond are inevitable as the game for both is baccarat, a game noted for an apparent air of sophistication and its ability to bestow--or wipe out--great wealth. (A point is in order. As I understand it, there are different variations on the game baccarat. I’ve sat with a friend in Las Vegas as he played a game that appears to be entirely a game of luck with no chance whatsoever for skill, much like roulette. The novel gives the rules here, but it did not seem to me that the rules were actually followed in the book. I may have missed something, but I gather there is no element of skill involved in the Macau game.)Doyle is profoundly self-aware. He is completely in love with gambling and waxes poetic about it throughout the novel. Even his rescue by a Chinese prostitute does nothing to interfere with his gambling. Indeed, he steals from her to continue.The question here is what the novel has to recommend it. The writing, as I noted, is lyrical. There are times--many, in fact--when I thought the author was simply trying too hard. Nonetheless, there is a passion here that elevates gambling in general and each hand in particular above the ordinary. The novel may not be the paranormal story some synopses have suggested, but it does almost make the quest into a sentient character. If the writing doesn’t sell the book, there is the character of Lord Doyle (who is not a lord). He is not precisely sympathetic, but he does have a certain charm, a painful honesty, and a clear voice that establishes him as fully human and thus evokes our sympathy. Put another way, at no point does he come across as someone we would want to court as a friend, but he does seem to be someone we would enjoy watching in a casino and rooting for. And if the language and Doyle don’t work, there’s always the setting, which is as well developed a character as any human in the story.As I say, the story is depressing, but the book is rewarding as an intimate portrayal of a gambler and of gambling. You will come away from this short novel with a deeper understanding of gambling, and, I dare say, it will change the way you look at a casino the next time you’re in one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5O7HEG75S3HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137978#wasThisHelpful","R5O7HEG75S3HJ","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decompression begins by setting up an ideal that is instantly attractive. Sven has fled the bustle of Germany to the Canary Islands, where he runs a diving school with his significant other, Antje. Amid the beauty of the islands, the two have an idyllic life. However, two visitors soon change things. A soap-opera star (Jola) and a writer (Theo) show up, and things change quickly. The two new arrivals hire Sven’s services for a week, and Sven quickly finds himself besotted. He spends time online watching Jola’s performances. Meanwhile, the two couples begin to provoke each other into increasingly high-stakes dares.Where the novel departs from what we’ve seen and read many times before is in Jola’s journal entries. It turns out that her perception of events does not quite square with Sven’s. Theo, initially somewhat amused by Sven’s infatuation, grows less tolerant and ultimately decidedly hostile. And as Sven’s fortieth birthday approaches, events reach a critical point.Decompression is more of a psychological thriller than a mystery or action thriller, and it suffers from a somewhat serious problem, at least for me. Sven is not an appealing person. His attraction to Jola is understandable, I suppose, but understanding something does not mean liking it. Nonetheless, I might still have rooted for Sven were it not for his treatment of Antje, which seems to border on cruel at times. (The words “seems to border on” are actually understatement. He is cruel and dismissive.) Still, the setting, the inevitability of something very bad happening, and the desire to know the resolution kept me turning the pages, and I did enjoy the book, albeit marginally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2NXC4AFPUA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537581#wasThisHelpful","R3E2NXC4AFPUA9","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many young or new writers are told the write what they know. Greg Kihn clearly has taken that advice to heart. Painted Black is a lot of fun. And it’s quite a history lesson at the same time. Oh, and there’s a paranormal element as well.Here, Kihn looks at Rolling Stones member Brian Jones’s death. Based on what seems to be equal parts documented truth and inventive fiction, the book follows Jones through the last year of his life before his death when he was found in his swimming pool. (I believe the death is officially attributed to an accident, but there have been theories that he was murdered.) Along the way, Kihn conveys a great picture of what it was like in the world of rock in the late ‘60s. If you are thinking about reading the book for the mystery of Jones’s death, you probably should move on. There is no dramatic revelation here (though there are suggestions).There are a fair number of problems with the book. The meshing of reality and speculation isn’t always seamless. The writing at times is clunky. And there are factual errors. But I trust Kihn’s love of and experience in rock, and I enjoyed the book as a look, however romanticized or ornamented, at much of the time and many of the people behind the rock of the ‘60s and ‘70s. I suppose those with a great knowledge of that background may find more to dislike about the book, but I enjoyed it. Oh, and it certainly doesn’t hurt that there are numerous songs mentioned, and many of those mentions brought tunes to mind.

"Getting Even is an example of a book I expected to like much more than I actually did. It’s a story of revenge, and it would have been, for me, a really fun, albeit slightly guilty, pleasure. Instead, I found myself too often questioning the basis for the story.That basis is the longstanding friendship between the ingenuous Orianna and the hardened Ivy. When the former gets a promotion at the place the two work, the latter begins to plot her revenge. The pair are certainly an odd couple, and I can’t help but think of Of Mice and Men as an example of a novel with an equally unlikely couple. However, Steinbeck explains his pair’s togetherness. Here, it is hard to see how two so unlikely (and, frankly, rather unrealistically extreme) characters would form a bond of friendship. And that bond is the key to the novel as Orianna begins to realize, painfully slowly, what is happening and, concurrent with that dawning awareness, tries to dismiss so much of the evidence.So for me, the friendship was always dubious, and the remainder of the novel, or at least as much as depends on that friendship, did not fully work. I can see the appeal here, though, as the novel exposes all sorts of machinations, maneuvering, and deception. But ultimately, I found the story simply lacking in important ways. The ending, whose general terms are clear long before it arrives, may be satisfying, but it's too little too late for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7FYMDP9U8CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042119#wasThisHelpful","R2W7FYMDP9U8CC","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think there are probably three different possible responses to Endangered. As the title indicates, the book is tendentious. It is a novel, yes, but it is clearly advancing a thesis, namely one about the unjust treatment of African Americans in the current American justice system. The three responses I imagine are (1) that here’s a book that tells a truth that too long has been ignored or explained away, (2) that here’s a book that is intent on playing the victim card for an entire group of people by overlooking a variety of salient facts (such as crime rates and more), and (3) that for African-American readers who have gone through this experience, here’s a book that validates their fears, frustration, and misgivings.The story involves teenage Malik, who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. Thus begins his mistreatment at the hands of a justice system that is designed to discriminate, systematically, against the socioeconomically disadvantaged. However, there is possible help on the line, from a White attorney who seems more interested in Malik as a type than as a young Black man facing an unjust charge to a Black attorney who also takes an interest in Malik’s mother.The book clearly is intended to expose a fundamental problem in the legal system, and I suspect that some who read this will dismiss it for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it posits an innocent caught in the system and thus misses a chance to talk about a broader facet, namely the unequal treatment of guilty people. But the story is well grounded in many of the current events of 2015 and certainly should be relatively easy to defend. In particular, I think it’s a fascinating companion to To Kill a Mockingbird, almost as if it’s a response to that book.As for the three reactions above, I strongly suspect those with the second reaction will readily dismiss the plot and point here. But others should find this honest expression of frustration to be generally powerful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K7LN1AEBA35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062316230#wasThisHelpful","R32K7LN1AEBA35","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m ambivalent about The Man Who Walked Away. On the one hand, I did find it often fascinating and mostly interesting in its exploration of a man who, in a fugue state, walks extensively (and I do mean extensively) and of a nascent psychiatric profession. The problem, at least for me, is that these two aims are often in conflict. The psychiatry of the late nineteenth century was simply not equipped to understand fully the mental states of the characters (including, of course, the title character) in the book. So we emerge from the book with an incomplete understanding of the fictional character Albert. I don’t know what the author could have done much differently, though. The novel is based on an actual man, so the story pretty much has to be restricted to the time and place in which the actual case occurred--unless author Maud Casey wanted to diverge substantially and thus lose a great deal of the flavor of the book.Thus, The Man Who Walked Away is more interesting than it is illuminating. I did see that one of the other reviews calls the book at times pedantic, and I see the basis for that claim. I found the story, however, of Albert and the other patients/inmates quite interesting. I have read also some readers’ frustration with the lack of a relatable character here, and I see that point too. This book may be a novel, but that fact does not mean that we find ourselves drawn to the protagonist (a term that may be inaccurate in this context if it conveys the sense that there is an antagonist). Rather, we have a mystery here, that of Albert’s fugue state, that ultimately is not completely explained. What we get instead is an investigation of the person, more understanding who he is than why he is that way. I enjoyed this investigation, but I was not expecting a standard, linear novel, and so I was not upset by the meandering, almost random, structure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38AQ3ZR8YLZ1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620403110#wasThisHelpful","R38AQ3ZR8YLZ1K","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is based on an actual person, an actual time, and actual events. It combines, apparently, careful research and thoughtful speculation. I say “apparently” because I think it’s important that I confess my ignorance of Brazilian history in general and communism in Brazil in particular. It may be that the novel is a gross mischaracterization of the people, the events, and the time, but I wouldn’t know. I decided to trust the author, and my trust rewarded me with an enjoyable read. It may seem that trust here is irrelevant. Given my lack of knowledge, couldn’t I just enjoy the book as a work of pure fiction? The answer is that I gained considerably by believing that I was gaining legitimate insight to a people and a time.The title character comes from a humble background but ultimately becomes involved with a leader of the communist movement. She is ultimately murdered, and the book deals primarily with attempts to explain, Rashomon-like, the woman and the events of her death. The exploration is as much about the culture into which she made her surprising entrance as about the individual, and I can see why many of the other reviewers called the book slow or boring. Had I viewed the book merely as a novel, I think I might have had the same reaction. But looking at it as history and realizing that with each sentence, I was expanding my knowledge made the task of reading this short book far more pleasant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG6Y6A1S0VNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477819789#wasThisHelpful","R2VG6Y6A1S0VNP","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Cure for Suicide is certainly not what one might call a beach books, the appearance of the pages notwithstanding. There are similarities of Kafka in the start to the book, and shades of Joyce toward the end, when the pace of the text goes from sparse and leisurely to frenetic, and overtones of Orwell throughout.The book introduces us to a claimant and an examiner, whose identities are not revealed much more beyond those titles except through their conversations. Gradually, we begin to piece together what is going on (thanks in part to the revealing title), but there is always--or was for me--a substantial disconnect. Ball offers little for us to cling to for comfort in the way of familiarity. We recognize that the claimant and the examiners are human, but the society is not recognizably any place in particular, and the time is also somewhat vague. So the book requires a great deal of work to understand, though I’m reminded of Walt Whitman’s criticism of parlor-room talks: Have you studied all this time just to get the meaning of poems? (I’m paraphrasing). I’m not sure that looking to A Cure for Suicide for a clear meaning is likely to work or is even the point here. This is a book for those who like experimental fiction and are willing to invest substantial time into a book. For those who like to read a book, turning the pages quickly to get to the ending that wraps everything together, I would suggest moving on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX2R2CR4019JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870125#wasThisHelpful","RX2R2CR4019JS","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the third book in a series, Stay with Me works well as a stand-alone novel. The plot has certain superficial similarities to Tana French’s In the Woods. A crime whose victim is a young child seems to mirror a crime that happened years ago. The investigator is heavily invested in the case because of a relationship to one of the victims. And memory plays an important role. There, for the most part, the similarities end.Here, the investigator is Brenna Spector, and she is related to both victims. The first, her teenage sister, disappeared years ago. Now, her daughter has disappeared under similar circumstances. Spector’s memory is nearly eidetic, but this apparent benefit is not always helpful.The pace is fast, and the story is compelling. What I found best about the novel is the main character. Spector has her life together for the most part (apart from the obvious fact that her daughter has disappeared). Her hyperthymesia sets her apart, but she strikes me as a strong woman who has solid relationships with those around her. In short, she seemed to be a solid character to guide me through a story populated by treachery and some very unsavory characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XIGWSZEV0NVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006187826X#wasThisHelpful","R2XIGWSZEV0NVP","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first. Assembly is, for the most part, easy and intuitive. The hard parts (the base and handle) come in five pieces that snap together easily and securely. There is also a pad that must be added, and even with the instructions, it wasn’t all that clear how they fit in. I don’t want to make a big deal of this point since I managed to get a pad attached in a few minutes, and it appears to have been securely attached since it hasn’t come off since.Now, the product itself. The most important point is that it works only on hard floors. Essentially, there are two parts. A roller picks up big things, and the pad catches the small stuff (dirt and hair, e.g.). The product absolutely will not work on carpet. Trying it on carpet will, in fact, dump the previously swept-up material onto the carpet, not what one desires.This product worked reasonably well, but it won’t replace a mop, and I’m not sure that it’s much better than a simple broom. I am also not all that sure that I prefer it to a standard dry sweeper. The one I have works on carpets and hard floors. It may lack the pad (and I do confess that the pad caught a fair amount of stuff), but the advantage of being able to use it in all areas of the house makes me prefer it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGYW9HQJIJVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBP7GPM#wasThisHelpful","RZGYW9HQJIJVK","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fatal Trauma is the first book I’ve read by Dr. Mabry. It probably will be the last. I simply did not find the story all that compelling, believable, or unique. It’s not that the story is bad per se. I just didn’t find that much to recommend it.The book begins with a hostage situation at a hospital. When the situation is apparently resolved with some violence, Mark, the protagonist doctor, finds his life in danger. Nor is he alone. Members of the Zeta gang/drug cartel have vowed revenge on everyone responsible for the outcome of the hostage situation. Moreover, Mark seems to have become a prime suspect as far as the police are concerned in the death of an officer.The pace is fast for the most part with occasional breaks for romance (including a love triangle) and theological musings. The portions relating to medicine and the hospital seem authentic (no surprise given the author), but overall, I simply found the story was not very convincing. The police seemed incompetent, and the drug cartel seemed unduly focused on revenge when I can’t think that doing so would be in the best interests of the cartel, either in terms of making money or in terms of avoiding prosecution. There are smaller parts that seemed unlikely and took me out of the story, but the bigger picture was more of a problem for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHYH6GCSZ0IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881163#wasThisHelpful","R3AHYH6GCSZ0IE","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wavered on the number of stars to give this book. The stories here are rich, and I think there is a great deal in them to spur thought and, better yet, discussion with other readers. And yet I can't say that I ""loved"" the book. I admired it, yes. I will read Lauren Holmes again gladly. But this first effort didn't completely captivate me.That said, there is quite a bit here worth recommending. First, the prose is smooth and accomplished. The stories are easy to read, so easy, in fact, that their depth may not at first be apparent. Take the first story, for example. In ""How Am I Supposed to Talk to You?,"" a young woman travels to Mexico to come out to her mother. The two are not on the best of terms, but they're not really enemies, either. It just seems that they would rather do something, anything, than actually talk. So for much of the story, not much happens. The revelation does eventually occur, and then--nothing much happens again.When I finished reading this story about a month ago, I had the feeling that I had missed something. But I really hadn't. Not much happens. But that not much is the key to the story, which is about the disconnect between these two and, at least on the daughter Lala's part, the deep, deep ambivalence about whether she wants something to happen. In many ways, this story isn't a ""story"" per se. It is a character study and an adept one at that.The title story is probably the strongest story. Here, an extremely intelligent and self-aware high-school student bound for Princeton had endured the taunts and torments of her peers, in large part because of her autistic brother and, I think, in large part because her tormentors simply do not know what to make of her. In this story, which is both a story (in the sense that it presents a fairly clear beginning, middle, and end) and a painfully honest character (and societal) study, Holmes show a remarkable talent. The deliberately provocative title hints at either exploitation or deep insight, and I was delighted to find that it was the latter that prevails. The ending is especially skillful here.The least effective story, for me, is either the boldest or the laziest. ""My Humans"" is told from the point of view of a dog. There's no doubt what the author was trying to do here. I just found the approach almost certainly doomed from the start. I can understand why many would disagree with me and really like the story, though, and I certainly love the short-story form for stories just like this, pieces in which authors can take chances. This one just didn't work for me. That said, the collection is strong, insightful, and certainly worth reading. You will find humor (but not slapstick), emotion but not melodrama, and insight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRXBBOLE0RTZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633789#wasThisHelpful","RRXBBOLE0RTZP","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doing Good Better represents a valuable resource for those who contribute to charities. Once you start contributing, you end up on sucker lists for all sorts of nefarious charities. There are lots of them out there that do almost no good for anyone. Yes, you get a tax deduction, but up to 100% of the donation can go to professional fundraisers. Of course, those charities tend to be the exception, but even some well-managed charities may not need your donation, however much they might protest to the contrary.What William MacAskill does here is set out a series of questions we should ask ourselves before giving. (Whether the supposed charity is in fact a fraud is not the focus of or even a major part of the book.) These questions may seem superfluous to many of us, especially those familiar with online charity evaluators such as Charity Navigator. After all, this website provides an easy-to-understand star rating, a few easy-to-digest numbers, and the CEO’s salary. MacAskill, however, finds this approach faulty, and he makes a good argument why.Still, the thought of reading a book to help determine giving (of time or money) may seem like a bit more effort than we’d ideally like to devote to such thinking, especially when it’s so quick and easy to write a check to the SPCA or Komen for the Cure. The good news is that Doing Good Better is interesting throughout. From the opening example of a movement to help African villages get water by putting children’s playground items (like a merry-go-round) in, hooking them up to a water pump, and--voila!--potable water to discussions about voting and more, Doing Good Better engages throughout. (A confession, though: I found the author’s argument in favor of voting less than persuasive. That’s not to say you shouldn’t vote, just that I don’t think you should vote based on MacAskill’s argument.)Ultimately, the questions here should make any donor think (even if the book does at time read as if it’s promotional material for givewell.org)--about necessary tradeoffs, relative good, desired outcomes, and more. And thinking donors are likely to be more effective donors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JNI8AQR2W0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409105#wasThisHelpful","R10JNI8AQR2W0V","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession first: When a writer avoids punctuation, I have to ask why. Often, there is a good reason (such as pacing). More often, I think, the problem is simply that the writer doesn’t know. When the writer refuses to use quotation marks, though, I get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that something else is at work: contempt for the reader. Few things make me so immediately antagonistic to writing as the avoidance of quotation marks. I can’t be certain, but I don’t believe there are any quotation marks in this book.The story involves someone who just might be the perfect American. He comes from wealth and a line of the Harvard-educated. After the events of September 11, 2001, he joins the Marines to fight overseas. He is shot, but his injury and recovery turn into an opportunity for him to write novels that do very well. When his beloved uncle dies of an apparent suicide, Jack does not believe the verdict and vows to uncover the truth, ultimately finding what appears to be a conspiracy that goes to the highest levels.I don’t know whether this book is supposed to be a mystery, a literary mystery, or what, but I don’t have the sense that the author has respect for the genre. Or maybe it’s competence that is lacking. I find it hard to believe that the solution won’t be evident to almost every reader well before the book is half over. The writing itself, ignoring the issue of the absence of quotation marks, is at times good and at other times hackneyed, sometimes almost laughable. (Before writing this review, I read other reviews to see whether I was being too critical. One of the reviews has an extensive quotation from the book of a scene between Jack and a woman he fancies. That scene is a good example of how bad parts of the book are.)I really found little worth recommending in Killer, Come Hither. The portrayal of the law firm seems uneducated, and I’m therefore not willing to put much stock in the author’s portrayal of the upper echelons of power and wealth. If you want a mystery, pick a different one. If you want a literary novel, there are countless others that are better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLUVUU7VYOTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539142#wasThisHelpful","R2WLUVUU7VYOTE","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I were limited to one sentence to describe The Dead Run, could not interject any opinion into that sentence (so that things like “I enjoyed it,” “It’s awful,” and “It revels in the macabre” are all impermissible), and had to try to let potential readers know whether they would enjoy it, I believe this would be my sentence: The book features an army of the virgin dead. That sentence alone should be sufficient for a potential reader. If the idea of an army of the virgin dead appeals to you, almost everything in the book should be right up your alley. That includes the wacko religious cult, a biker gang, a Mexican setting, complete with bar and corruption, a good-guy American in prison, and more. At this point, the plot is almost superfluous, but there is one, and author Mansbach keeps it moving along very quickly, pausing every so often for a great deal of bloodshed and gore.At this point, though, I’m not sure what more I can add. So I’ll just repeat myself. The book features an army of the virgin dead. Your decision whether to read the book should be based pretty much on that fact alone.

"Three Story House (why no hyphen?) is about three cousins who end up in Memphis refurbishing a house that needs a great deal of work—as do they. We have the athlete, Lizzie, whose Olympic dreams are in serious jeopardy because of a serious injury; the child actress, Isobel, who lives of income from a rental; and the disillusioned woman who is questioning life because her former boyfriend has married her sister. As the three try to figure out the next stages in their lives, they renovate the house.The novel was an easy enough read without any serious twists and turns and with an ending that you can see long before the characters can. The characters’ progress and the house’s run roughly in parallel; as the cousins pull themselves together, so they pull the house together. I never found myself terribly invested in the cousins’ lives, but I did find the sense of place in the book well done. Memphis comes alive as another character and works well to support the women’s struggles to rebuild (their lives and the house). As a rather light novel, Three Story House worked well, but there is not all that much depth here, and the knowledge of where the story was heading and mostly how it would get there prevented me from becoming too caught up in it. However, for those who like happy endings and stories of redemption, Three Story House is well written and probably just the thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMRRAKJSM4MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062130544#wasThisHelpful","RGMRRAKJSM4MB","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story revolves around Aurelia and the Ball, an annual event filled with all sorts of sexual escapades. Aurelia, orphaned by parents who escaped the ball, gave birth to her, and died, eventually returns to the Ball, which may be where she is destined to be. Gradually, her sexual desires come to the fore, and she seems to be drawn to the Ball and her deep connection with and to it. The plot is fairly straightforward, but it does at time seem to become secondary compared to the erotic elements, which pop up frequently.I found the book rather uninspiring. Perhaps part of that response is attributable to the fact that this book several books into a series that I have not read. But I think that I would have had the same response had this been book one. I never felt terribly connected to the characters; did not really have any emotional investment in Aurelia or her fate; and found the sense of fate or destiny, such as it is, too limited to be truly interesting. (Regarding the last point, I suppose my objection is this: Aurelia’s connection to the Ball seems to be more about an awakening of her sexuality than about any personal growth to speak of.) As for the erotic elements, and there are many, I don’t believe they really added much to the story after a point. That the Ball is Dionysian is clear early on. But once its hedonistic character is established, there comes a point at which the erotica seems to exist for its own sake, making the story somewhat secondary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ5D0U2FDLSS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480474274#wasThisHelpful","RJ5D0U2FDLSS2","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those Girls recycles many of the themes in all sorts of recent teen fiction: the elite girls; the back-stabbing, cruelty, and manipulation of others; the sex and drugs; and the insecurity at the heart of these girls. Using themes we’ve seen before is fine. The question is what the author does with those themes. The answer I found here is: not enough.There are three girls at the core of the story, and though each is clearly distinguished from the others, they are all identical in the most important respects. They are of a type: privileged, cruel, and insecure. Though these facets manifest themselves in various ways (promiscuity for one, abstinence for another, e.g.), the end result is the same: damaged girls damage themselves further and lash out at those around them. I’m sure people like these girls exist, and I’m equally sure that much of this book will ring true for many. For me, though, it seemed like too much that I’ve seen before without adding anything especially new. There's too little exploration of the girls' pasts. Old tropes just aren't enough. And the ending . . . I won’t reveal too much except to say that I found it profoundly disappointing.

"Acts of Contrition worked for me because of the well-drawn characters. Mary, the primary character, in particular, is complex, intelligent, strong (mostly)—and flawed in a human way. In simplest terms, the story involves Mary and Tom, a happily married couple raising a wonderful family and living what many might describe as the ideal life. They work, they love each other and their children, and they live happily and well. However, Mary has a secret that threatens to rear its head and destroy her marriage and her family. (That the couple is Catholic plays an important role in the story, but I left it out of the plot summary because much of what happens here and many of Mary’s deliberations would be more or less the same for people of any—or no—faith. Catholics, and Christians more broadly, might relate more closely to the novel, but I think that just about any adult who has been married or committed to another can relate to the story.)The nature of Mary’s secret does not remain a mystery long, and the book focuses on the humanity of its main characters. Acts of Contrition works, in many ways, I think, like a Jodi Picoult novel. The author focuses on the characters, develops them, and gives them both strengths and flaws. The look here at Mary and her family is a serious one, a sincere attempt to explore the effects of a bad decision in the past and the possibly good, possibly bad decisions that build on it in the present. This book may not be as deep an exploration of human psychology as one finds in Dostoevsky, but the book is human and effective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RBJXC23BE8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477809503#wasThisHelpful","R12RBJXC23BE8Q","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have described the plot in detail, I'll avoid doing so here. I will, however, note that some of the reviews' summaries confuse me even two weeks after I finished the book. That fact is probably attributable to the novel's curious nature. Part science fiction, part mythology, part character study, and big part environmental/climate tale, The Man with the Compound Eyes is a meandering book that I enjoyed while reading but cannot really piece together only two weeks later. To the extent that the book is, in some ways, a collection of interconnected stories, I enjoyed the individual stories even if I didn't fully understand the big picture at all times. (Part of the failure, a big part, comes from the way I read, typically with at least four books going at the same time. Normally, I have no problems with such an approach. Here, though, the novel really should have been my entire focus.)

"My background may be helpful here (if only to help prospective purchasers decide that my advice is not helpful). I have taught math at the high-school and college levels for many years. I have taken the GMAT and earned a perfect score. I have also tutored scores of students for the GMAT (though not recently). In general, I know both math and the test. Also, I have never in any way been affiliated with Manhattan Prep. I have not worked for, competed with, or studied under Manhattan Prep.So when I say that this book offers solid preparation for the GMAT, I do so from the perspective of someone with a fair amount of knowledge of the material and the test but no need for such a book. I do believe that anyone who can go through all 400 pages or so of the book and understand everything will be in an excellent position on the GMAT. But I do have some concerns.The positives: The book goes through not only the math but also the structure of the questions and a variety of means of solving, in many cases allowing the reader to sidestep complicated math entirely. Because some of the question formats will be foreign to students, Manhattan Prep's focus on what exactly these questions mean and how to do them will be especially helpful. The problems range from fairly easy to quite difficult and thus should give thorough preparation. The step-by-step solutions should be sufficient for almost everyone.The negatives: A 400-page book is awfully long, especially for those who have never really gotten along with math. Though many of the pages have a lot of white space for diagrams and equations, I still think that the book will be intimidating to some. Also, there are a few spots in which I thought the explanations could have been clearer. (I have sympathy for the book's creators on this point. Writing a book like this requires the authors to walk a sometimes hard-to-see line between saying too much and boring those who have a solid grasp of the math and saying too little and losing those for whom math is more difficult.

"The Rules is advertised on the back of my copy as Saw meets I Know What You Did Last Summer. I'm not sure about the Saw portion, but the second half of the comparison seems fairly accurate. I tend to hold books to a higher standard than I do teen horror films, and thus for me, this book was not exactly an enjoyable read. The characters are not especially sympathetic. They often die fairly quickly, thus not allowing us to get much of a chance to root for them. And their actions are often foolish (thus leading to their deaths).That said, I could see why this book might appeal to its target audience of teens. In fact, I think I would have enjoyed this in my teens, when I could relate to many of the shenanigans in the characters' lives. And certainly the plot races along, so those who want an emphasis on action will no doubt be thrilled. However, for me as an adult, the book just sort of sat there; it didn't engage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30VJ3J4PXF5MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385741006#wasThisHelpful","R30VJ3J4PXF5MF","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember in elementary school having to do book reports in which I identified the main character. Had I been given The Shore then, I probably would have identified the setting as the main character. This book jumps around chronologically, from the twentieth to the nineteenth century and back and, ultimately, to the twenty-second century. The characters disappear and reappear until it ultimately becomes clear that they are from the same few families. (Just exactly how many probably will be clear in the final edition, but I did not have the benefit of the genealogy in my review copy.)Having read the book, I certainly cannot say that I enjoyed it. There is too much pain and cruelty here for that. I do recall at one point being grateful for the disjointed structure since it kept me from getting too close to any of the characters and thus feeling the pain and suffering as acutely.Though The Shore may not be pleasurable to read, it is rewarding. First, Sara Taylor’s writing, though sometimes raw, is generally accomplished and effective. Second, the book’s presentation of a narrow history, one mostly limited by the geography of this Virginia locale, is sweeping and does indeed help us see the big picture of historical and familial continuity, almost of destiny as established by genetics and geography.Like other reviewers, I found the first story the most compelling and longed to return to it (as we do eventually). Unlike other readers (I hope), I did not know the approach the book was going to take and thus was frustrated by the approach. But those who understand the nonlinear approach ahead of time should find the book more rewarding than I did.I dallied a long time before writing this review, largely because of the difficulty of assigning a star rating to it. I dislike these ratings in general (though I understand their purpose) and tried to think of what they meant. Ultimately, I decided that they are personal, subjective. So I asked myself whether I would recommend this book to myself. In other words, if I could somehow travel back in time to the point at which I selected this book, would I advise myself to get and read it? The answer is no, and that’s a fairly easy answer. For as much as I admire the craft here, it is the accumulation of rape, drugs, poverty, disease, abuse, and more that makes this not something I would want to read. That’s not a criticism of the book (and certainly these topics are important). It’s an indication of a mismatch between Sara Taylor as a writer and me as a reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0ZJMOJA490V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553417738#wasThisHelpful","R2H0ZJMOJA490V","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My sister and I learned when we were very young that we were both adopted. For me, that fact was almost meaningless. My life was with the family I grew up in; it was the only life I’d ever known. The only time my adoption became an issue was when others made it one. My sister, on the other hand, ultimately sought out her birth parents. They briefly formed a relationship, but I don’t believe that much came of it. As for me, I’ve always been grateful to the woman who gave me life and understand that those nine months and the decision must have been difficult.So I have a personal connection to this story of a woman who gives up her baby. And as far as meshing with my own life—well, it didn’t. Part of the problem is the main character, Kate, who comes across as a thoroughly self-obsessed, selfish, trouble-causing jerk. (I’m not comfortable saying that because an author’s note at the end of the book reveals that Kate is based on a real person. But I do hope that the fictional Kate is not an accurate reflection of the story’s inspiration.) In fact, just about the only decision she makes that makes sense is giving up her child for adoption.I had a difficult time rooting for her in the romantic triangle that motivates many of her decisions. Given that the book is entirely predictable, much in the way a Hallmark made-for-television movie is, that lack of a rooting interest proved fatal. Nor is there much to recommend the writing. I do sense that this book was probably quite emotional for the author to write. But for me, the disconnect between Kate and me and the disconnect between my experiences with adoption and what seems to be the conception here were too great. And Then I Found You was definitely not for me, my pre-reading hopes notwithstanding.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5GUIE77Y2F8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312610769#wasThisHelpful","R5GUIE77Y2F8D","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before We Kiss is the third Fool’s Gold romance that I’ve read but feels as if it is only the first or second since it is so strikingly similar to at least one other series entry. For the uninitiated, the Fool’s Gold series is set in Fool’s Gold, a small town in northern California. Like many small-town romance series, the cast tends to appear in multiple novels, and the town itself is as much a character as the people, albeit sometimes in a forced manner.In this book, there are two unresolved romances. The first involves Sam and Dellina. He is a former professional football player who now works in Fool’s Gold as a member of the company he, two other players, and a woman formed together. She works in party planning. Their first contact, before the book begins, was a one-night stand that ended when he went into the wrong room, saw several wedding gowns and a whiteboard with comments related to weddings, and freaked out, leaving almost immediately. When the novel begins, he is hiring her to help organize a party for his company.The other relationship involves one of Dellina’s sisters, who is in a long-term relationship with a man who will not ask her to marry him. In this case, he has good reason. She told him that she wanted to wait four years, and so he has been respecting her explicit wishes—much to her disappointment.The relationships here seem to be on the emotional and intellectual level of seventh-grade students. There is one scene at the end in particular that echoes an almost identical scene from a different Fool’s Gold book in which a character behaves abominably. In other words, the characters, though presumably of legal age, act as if they are children. Moreover, they know it. There are multiple instances in the book in which characters tell themselves or are told by others how stupidly they are behaving. I don’t recommend this book or, indeed, the series for anyone looking for insight or depth. There just isn’t much here.Other information: The sex is graphic, and there is one especially long scene that can be skipped, though it might work reasonably well as a how-to manual since the descriptions are quite precise. (The scene is at least interesting in one sense, though. The two lovers discuss his mother twice during their session.) There is some, but not much, swearing. The book does not require prior knowledge of the series. Though previous events are part of the plot, they are well enough described that the new reader should not feel lost.  And I have no idea what the title is supposed to refer to since the primary relationship develops long after the lovers have done much more than kiss.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11DEX45LMJOW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778813#wasThisHelpful","R11DEX45LMJOW2","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this collection, Karen Joy Fowler certainly provides variety. We have, for instance, a story about Albert Einstein and the daughter whose existence recently came to light with a series of letters. There is the science-fiction account of women living in Berkeley in the 1960s, an account that owes more to women's studies than to science fiction. There is the Shirley Jackson-like story of a woman whose son's trivia questions lead her to imagine a scenario that somehow bleeds into real life.I think the best part of the collection is the variety, but not just the variety in terms of subject matter. The stories are as short as four pages and as long as 50 or more. The forms are varied as well. Some have fairly traditional narration while others vary the form considerably. And throughout, there seems to be a focus on those who don't quite fit in, who exist on the margins. You may not like all 15 stories (I didn't), but if you are a serious reader and enjoy stories that challenge you to think, you're sure to find quite a few here to please you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRBQ6L2UG3UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399175792#wasThisHelpful","R2NRBQ6L2UG3UL","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This re-imagining of the Sherlock Holmes stories takes place when Holmes is a schoolboy. Moriarty, here a schoolgirl, tells the story as she and Sherlock meet, come across a police investigation, and compete to solve it, ultimately drawing closer to each other. As a general rule, I dislike pastiches that deviate substantially from the canon. This one certainly does that, changing the gender of Moriarty. But it seems to work because of the most significant change, namely setting the story when the two are children.I would not recommend the novel to diehard fans of the canon, though, as this really is not so much a pastiche as it is a story that happens to use two characters who are featured prominently in a classic series of short stories. It also bears mention that the characters' brilliance is more told than shown. For example, Mori keeps three dice with her in part to relieve boredom. One day, she rolls them and comes up with a combination whose probability is 1/216. That probability is accurate, but it is also misleading, and the conclusions Mori draws from it are somewhat silly. After all, there are other 1/216 probabilities--35 others to be exact. But the original stories also had their problems, such as Holmes's deduction that someone must be highly intelligent because he has a large head. And this one's not likely to cause many of the target audience to balk.And for the target audience, youths who have not yet formed an intense attachment to the Holmes canon, the story and the mystery probably work. In fact, if we remove the fact that we're reading about THE Sherlock Holmes and THE James Moriarty, we're left with a reasonably well done and fairly standard YA novel about misfits who happen to be precocious. For devotees of the original, though, the story might be enjoyable, but it does not add much, apart from a change of gender for one character and a substantial exploration of her dysfunctional family, to the canon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DG07O02ULT9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481423037#wasThisHelpful","R3DG07O02ULT9J","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I admired the author's craft and especially the translation, I found little emotional impact in the stories here. As a general rule, they are not plot-driven tales but instead focus on character and human interaction. Probably the best constructed, best written, and all-around best story is the first, ""Hiding Places,"" which involves an untimely death, characters' reactions to that death, and characters' responses to those reactions. (It is hard to discuss the stories without giving away too many details.) I was immediately drawn into this story by the writing and the narrator's voice only to find myself slogging through the middle until an especially evocative ending.The worst story in the book, for my money, is ""The Return,"" which is the shortest. In this tale, a woman kills her sister's husband to preserve family ownership of an ancestral house. The story seems to have the air of a fairy tale or a ghost story, both in the events and in the manner in which it is told, but ultimately the ending seemed to me a bit ridiculous for this treasury. That said, ""The Return"" is easily the most accessible story in the book.Ultimately, the stories are bleak with very little warmth, kindness, or charity shining through. And perhaps it's that bleakness that kept me from connecting more with this collection. And that failure to connect really is too bad given how much I admired the writer's and translator's craft.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVUQWMD0AJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634262#wasThisHelpful","R3GVUQWMD0AJ3","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not Jewish. My last name is of German origin, but that side of my family has been in the United States since the 19th century. I mention these points because there is nothing in particular that should draw me to ""Hidden Inheritance,"" which deals with the author's discovery of a Jewish heritage of which she was completely unaware.The story of how she discovered this heritage is itself rather remarkable. An Internet search turned up the completely unexpected results. As far as Heidi Neumark (herself a Lutheran pastor) knew, her family was everything she thought it was: a fairly typical Christian family. But when she discovers her family's connection to the Holocaust (or, to use the term she prefers, Shoah), she is in for some serious questioning about herself, her past, the role of faith, and more.What makes this book so wonderful for me is the writing. Without being too informal, it is almost conversational, complete with all sorts of tangents and diversions and with references to things that haven't been fully explained yet. (As a simple example of the last point, there are multiple references to the discovery well before Newmark explains in more detail the circumstances.) It's quite hard for me to explain what makes the book so wonderful beyond that quality. I don't want to give away too many details. And the non-linear nature of the telling makes it difficult to know what can be revealed. But I can definitely say that ""Hidden Inheritance"" is an easy read and a fascinating one--even for those with few or no ties to the Shoah.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7YIPCY0O6L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881244#wasThisHelpful","R3S7YIPCY0O6L8","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This snorkel and mask are wonderful. First, the fit is great. There’s no discomfort, and I had no problems with leaking. Out of force of habit, I spat in the window beforehand, so I can’t say whether that’s necessary. Too many years of doing so, I suppose. But I suspect the mask will not fog up otherwise. The fact that the snorkel automatically closes (one way, you can still exhale) underwater is great. I kind of miss the fun of rising from the water and blowing out a stream of water, but I got over that feeling quickly. And afterward, when I removed the mask, I didn’t have that oval of pressure that I’ve so long associated with snorkel masks. In fact, I think I could have worn this for hours. Finally, the view is great. It’s really about as close to being to see underwater (meaning as a fish must) as I’ve ever experienced with a mask. (And for the sake of clarity, I will note that I’m not anything near a professional or even habitual snorkeler.

"“Bennington Girls Are Easy”—maybe, but since I didn’t attend Bennington and have not known any Bennington alumnae, I have to take the title of the book on faith. And for me, I think therein lies the problem. I did not attend Bennington, so many of the in-jokes and much of the background that the author seems to assume the reader share just are not part of my experience. So the book read a lot like something that I am not expected to fully understand.The story of two nearly lifelong best friends who grow up together, attend Bennington together, go to Cambridge and then New York together, and so forth just didn’t captivate me. Part of the problem, other than my alma mater (a small liberal-arts college, for what it’s worth) is that the book’s set-up relies far too much on telling rather than showing. I don’t really get why the two women are friends. We’re told they’re friends, but that’s not the same as telling us why. The closes the author comes is in one of the many instances of authorial intrusion in which we’re told that to be best friends two people must love and hate the same things. Another part of the problem is that in the majority of the book, neither character seems to develop that much. I really never cared all that much about what happens to either one.I’ve read that two reviews liken this to the film “The Last Days of Disco,” which I enjoyed. Other than some superficial similarities, though, I don’t really see the comparison. I’m giving this three stars because I believe it may appeal to Bennington alumni (both male and female), but it didn’t do much for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP9EF7PG6BHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538960#wasThisHelpful","R3GP9EF7PG6BHE","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are the things I liked about the Konf-X Buds. (1) The cords are long. There is a cord from the ear buds to the control and then one from the control to the jack. Both are plenty long. I used this product while walking and had no difficulties with a short cord pulling the buds out of my ears. (2) The left and right buds are shaped differently to fit into the specific ears. (Well, they’re actually shaped the same, just as mirror images of each other. The do fit into the wrong ears OK, but they fit well in the proper ears.) (3) The buds fit snugly. (4) These work without the noise-cancelling feature on and without a battery. In other words, they function as simple ear buds. There’s no need to use a battery just to listen. (5) All of the buttons are easily accessible without the user having to look at them. (There are only three buttons or switches anyway.)Here is the thing I didn’t like: The buds are not entirely comfortable. They don’t cause any serious discomfort, but I could tell I had them in, and there was a very small amount of discomfort.Here is the thing I’m indifferent about: The noise-cancelling feature did not seem to have any great benefit. During my walk, I listened to an audiobook and to music, and I was near a heavily traveled street. Switching the feature on had no noticeable effect on what I could hear from outside (i.e., the traffic) and only a minimal effect on the thing I was listening to. The most obvious effect was that the volume decreased ever so slightly.So in the end, I like these ear buds, but I’m not sure that I’d spend all that much on them. In fact, if I had, I think I'd be upset.UPDATE: One day after posting the review above, I tried the noise-reduction feature once again, and this time I noticed a stark difference. It really does reduce noise substantially. I don't know that I'd say I experienced a 90% reduction, but there was a clear difference with the feature on and off. I've thought about what I might have done differently in the two tests, and the only possibility I can come up with is the placement of the buds themselves. I may not have had them firmly in my ears the first time, perhaps the result of having walked a mile. But I'm pleased to report that the noise-reduction (or noise-cancelling) feature really does work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UBE3JMKTS0W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUBG5NG#wasThisHelpful","R1UBE3JMKTS0W6","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“A Dictionary of Mutual Understanding” is a magnificent novel. It manages to be both universal, reflecting a deep understanding of humanity, and especially Japanese, conveying Japanese culture with almost every sentence. (A word of qualification: I have never been to Japan and have no particular connection with Japanese culture, so it is possible that I am mistakenly judging the presentation here as a faithful reflection of Japanese culture. I don’t think so, however.)Octogenarian Amaterasu is a survivor of World War II and the nuclear bombing of Japan. She has spent most of her life since trying to deal with all of the emotions of that time and subsequent life and trying to understand things. Part of her means of dealing with things is turning to alcohol. This existence, although not much more than an existence, seems to work. One day, however, a man appears at her door. He claims to be her grandson, whom she thought dead. But he claims to have proof and provides her with this evidence. As Amaterasu begins to sift through letters and journal entries, she is compelled to face many of the questions about the past, questions that she had tried to put behind her.As I said, this is a wonderful look at humanity in general. Amaterasu’s past may be particularly Japanese, and her way of dealing with many of the events of her life is no doubt shaped by her background. But the book is really about much more than Japanese culture. It is thoughtful, insightful, and genuinely moving. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344PCO2AFTOB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143128256#wasThisHelpful","R344PCO2AFTOB3","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two primary characters in the novel: Jane, an ex-pat journalist come to Africa to do a story about the abduction of over 100 students in Uganda and to flee from her past, and Esther, one of the 30. The story alternates between them, giving them roughly equal weight, and therein lies one of the problems I have with the novel. The real-life abductions of so many girls and the subsequent failure to gain the release of 30 of them is a powerful story that needs to be shared and needs to outrage us (as, indeed, it did briefly). And Esther’s story is indeed powerful. But it’s treatment here struck me as unjust, making it share the stage with the frankly dull and self-obsessed Jane. There is a fair amount of good in “30 Girls,” but there is much that I did not like. Among the latter points is the writing itself. I got the sense early on that Minot has if not contempt for the reader, at least disdain. The writing struck me as deliberately turgid in some places and deliberately Literary with a capital L. Commas and quotation marks, for example, are rare. I know that there are strong passions about writing styles, and I suspect that some will view my comments as the disdain of the great unwashed for brilliance. Fair enough. But I would caution the reader, even the well-read reader, to read the first few pages before deciding whether to purchase this novel. In my mind, there is nothing wrong with punctuation to make meaning clear. At the same time, the writing is at times one of the best features of the novel. Esther’s voice comes through clear and strong, and I have little trouble believing that Esther is a real person. Indeed, her story, of lost hope, of torture and imprisonment, and of almost unspeakable abuse, is a powerful one and is rendered here in a way that keeps that power . . . except for the fact that we lose it so often when we switch back to the other story. As another of the reviews here put it, the girls deserve better (to which I add that they deserve to be the story, not serve another story).","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394NY22QEGTDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266389#wasThisHelpful","R394NY22QEGTDN","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Blood Tattoo"" is, I gather, book seven in the Nicholas Colt series, but it is the first for me. I did not feel as if I missed anything by jumping into the series in book 7.Nicholas, former guitar player of some note, is now living in Florida, where he runs a small shop giving guitar lessons and lives with his wife, a woman whose trust has begun to wear thin. One Sunday, a day Nicholas normally takes off, he gets a call from someone who claims to need an emergency guitar lesson. He is naturally suspicious, but the $200 she offers overcomes his suspicions. When he meets the woman, she tells him that she works for the government in a high-level capacity and that she needs his help. She has uncovered a plan to assassinate the president, and she knows the name of the intended assassin: it is hers. In exchange for the promise of much greater money in the future, Nicholas agrees to help out, though he really does not understand much of anything about the woman or her position.Thus begins an action-filled romp in which Nicholas tries to help the woman even as his marriage seems to crumble. Oh, and he continues to give guitar lessons.There were implausibilities in the book (excluding the entire over-the-top plot) that distracted me at times, such as Nicholas's reaching into the glove compartment to remove his gun while he is driving his car over 100 miles per hour during a chase, but I think that the book requires a certain suspension of disbelief. Once that small leap is made, the store is enjoyable, and the book is certainly a page turner. One slight caution may be in order. Nicholas's wife's diary entries are included, and they provide a great deal of back story--and, I assume, substantial plot details for the earlier books. As I haven't read those books (yet), I can't say whether there are intense spoilers. But there may well be. On its own, though, ""Blood Tattoo"" reminded me of some of the Elvis Cole books by Robert Crais, albeit without the smart-aleck remarks commentary. The styles are similar in that the protagonist has a clear and well-defined voice and the stories mix personal life with adventure well. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G9DBTH77L8FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477809708#wasThisHelpful","R1G9DBTH77L8FG","AQ2UN38CMK119","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ2UN38CMK119?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use them on my computer for a variety of things: gaming, music, movies.  Since it comes with a case and it's modest in size I also use it with my laptop from time to time.  I can highly recommend the Sentey headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1814FSU3HW019/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R1814FSU3HW019","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was provided to me by Wolverine for review.  The Wolverine head lamp has three adjustable straps and fits easily on my head.  The light is powerful enough to light up small areas.  I mostly use it for detail work like when I need to open up electronics and fix them.  It runs on AAA batteries which is great because you can get those any where.  I actually use rechargeable batteries in my head lamp so I'll always be able to replace them easily.  The Wolverine head lamp is simple and it gets the job done.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKFG0ESRZUVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R2CKFG0ESRZUVH","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was provided at a discount for review.  HGW and Maca are great for libido and energy boosting.  I take it daily so it was natural for me to try this product.  It's a great combination for men's health and vitality.  Maca also gives a boost of energy without the stimulant downsides so I actually take it in the morning before working out.  Maca itself is very natural it comes from a plant and has multiple benefits.  I can highly recommend this supplement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQF38MJ09UJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ434TI#wasThisHelpful","R1UQF38MJ09UJQ","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was provided to me at a discount for review.  HGW is a very beneficial supplement for libido boosting so it's something I take on a regular basis.  This one includes Yohimbe which also helps libido but it's a powerful stimulant.  So you have to be careful when you use it.  I only take Yohimbe in the morning to avoid having trouble sleeping at night.  I wish the dosage of Yohimbe was lower so the stimulant effect wasn't so high but your mileage may vary on this one.  Overall it's a good supplement for men looking to boost their libido just be careful with over doing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FE4BLF3BEF1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8FF21M#wasThisHelpful","R2FE4BLF3BEF1N","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was provided to me for free for review by Pro-Sys.  A toothbrush is a pretty simple purchase but you definitely want one that is effective and stays clean.  The Pro-Sys toothbrush is effective when it comes to both.  The bristles are strong but still flexible.  And it's stayed clean for the entire time I've used it.  It's still a dispoable toothbrush so you will have to replace it periodically.

"This product was provided to me for review by Number One Nutrition.  I was looking for a diuretic to keep water weight in check and this one fits perfectly.  It has dandelion root which is the most important ingredient because it's a potassium sparing diuretic.  Meaning you won't lose potassium which is a problem with a lot of other diuretics.  Diuretics are good for reducing water retention.  You have to already be very lean to see the difference, but it definitely helps.  This product help me shed a little bit of water weight.The only negative is that it has B6 which it's possible to overdose on with negative consequences.  Most people would never hit the limit, but if you take other supplements like a multivitamin or ZMA supplement you might already be getting B6.  So in that case you have to be careful.But it's not worth taking off a star for.

" 1:00 Mins Today we're unboxing the Aukey 20 Watt Solar Charger.  This product was provided to me by the manufacturer for review.  It's a solar charger that will fuel your devices using sunlight so you don't need to use an outlet.  It has a canvas exterior and it's rather larger in size, but that's expected with a 20 watt solar charger.  This is perfect for someone who is active outdoors.  And it should work even on a cloudy day, but obviously with less charge.  It also includes carabiners for hanging from a backpack or somewhere outdoors.It has 3 panels and these are also water and dust resistant.  In the back there's a zipper netted pocket for storing battery banks or your phone that you are charging.  It has two USB output ports so you can charge two devices simultaneously.  I'm testing it by setting in front of the window and connecting it to my Galaxy S5 and I'm receiving a solid charge on a sunny day.  This Aukey charger is perfect for someone who is outdoors a lot, doesn't have access to an outlet, or just wants to live greener.  It's currently $54.99 which is comparable to other chargers with the same wattage.  I highly recommend this charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNFZZLH4Z2QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011UH0ZCY#wasThisHelpful","R3HNFZZLH4Z2QM","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product was provided to me at a discount for review.  I've used different tension workout bands for a while now during exercise.  Resistance bands have so many uses, I consider them essential.  They can be used to assist you on pull ups, they can be used to add resistance to barbell exercise, and they can also be used to perform exercises.  You can do a full body workout with resistance just using bands which is great for working out at home or while traveling.  They also provide a different type of tension compared to lifting free weights or using cable machines.  I use them for when I workout at home as a substitute for free weight exercises.  I bought the red band which is the lightest, but was the only one I was missing from my collection of bands.  But all of the bands are useful.  You can even combine two smaller bands to equal the resistance of a stronger band.  These are also very durable and built to last.  I highly recommend these WOD Buddy bands to any one who works out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9RYB504JM8EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01263ON06#wasThisHelpful","R9RYB504JM8EA","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fact that you can launder it or even clean it in the dishwasher is fantastic.  These will last much longer than disposable sponges.

" 6:50 Mins This is probably the biggest game collection ever spanning decades worth of Rare games.  Welcome to the SKILLED channel.  And today we're looking at the Rare Replay collection.  There's something for everyone in this package.  And it's a great idea for people who are life long fans or even those new to Rareware games.  Do all of these ports play well and did Rare do a good job at packaging 30 distinct games into one collection?  Let's find out and see if Rare Replay is worth playing.Everything about this Rare showcase is exceptional in its presentation.  It has a full musical intro that's more than a minute long showing the celebration of Rareware's history.  The menu is incredibly detailed with everything in chronological order of our favorite Rare games.  There's a snapshots mode which are short challenge sections of selected games.  Then there's a collection of Rare documentaries, from games that never passed the concept art phase to behind the scenes footage.  But in order to watch these, you have to unlock them by playing the games from this collection.  This video is more of a first impression and an overview of the features, because there's no way we could could complete all of these games for this review.Starting with the N64 era, it's nice to see that these games work as well as the original.  The N64 generation itself hasn't aged well, but the Rareware games are probably the strongest of the bunch due to their unique design.  They've also been a little harder to access in modern times so it's great to have it here.  With the incredibly unique Blast Corps where you blow up buildings and get money for it.  To the classic platforming of Banjo Kazooie.  Banjo Kazooie is actually the upgraded XBLA version, but that's great because it already has all the improvements of higher resolution and dual analog controls.  Some games don't hold up well like Jet Force Gemini.  They offer an option for modern controls, but no matter what you select it's incredibly awkward and can best be described as tank controls.The old school games looks incredible blocky with the low resolution uprezzed to 1080p.  There is an option for a CRT filter which makes it looks like an old TV and in my opinion it's a much more reasonable appearance even though it's designed for nostalgia.  There's also a beautifully crafted border tailored to each game.  I usually turn off these kinds of features because they are distracting, but these look so good I had to leave them on.  One of the Rarest highlights from the collection is Battletoads Arcade.  The game looks and runs really well for a 2D Beat Em Up because it was released exclusively for the Arcade and now this is the only way to get it without resorting to emulation.Xbox 360 EraThe Xbox 360 era was the category that I was most interested in, but also most disappointed in.  I was surprised how poorly some of these games ran.  All games run under an Xbox 360 emulator instead of being ported natively.  The game has to load the 360 interface and on the first game I ran, it took quite a while to initialize.  Kameo Elements of Power ran fine.  Viva Pinata runs ok.  But Perfect Dark Zero suffered some slow downs even during somewhat simple moments.  Then moving on to Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts the slow down was unbearable.  Walking around in the town and even sometimes during cutscenes was atrocious.  I know I'm not the only one complaining about these slow downs you can look around the net to see other responses.  But a lot of people tend to downplay the slowdown problem due to nostalgia glasses.Other than that, the games handle and play the same as they did on 360, since they are the most recent games.  Aside from slowdown, functionality and controls are all intact.  It is nice to have access to these more modern Rare games in one place.  These games have their own unique values to them. There's Kameo which is as an adventure game that focuses on transforming.  Viva Pinata which is a strangely fun garden simulator.  Perfect Dark Zero has some fun elements and really sets itself apart from modern military shooters.  However it is dated in some ways.  The characters really exude the mid 2000 fashion style.  And the controls are incredibly floaty, it's very difficult to have precision when moving and shooting.RemasteringThe graphics are generally the same as the original versions, with the exception of the XBLA ported remasters like Banjo Kazooie.  Of course we would all love 100% touched up graphics in the 3D games, but it's not really going to be possible.The UI really shows a lot of care and they didn't leave you hanging in any way.  There's options for everything you could possibly need to beat these old games.  And even save states, rewinds, and unlimited lives in some of the old school games.  That way you can actually beat those hard classics without driving yourself crazy.I know everyone is wondering where's Donkey Kong Country?  Or how about StarFox adventures?  Those games are lost in licensing so you won't see them in this pack.  But the classics that are included here are loads of fun and still maintain everything from the original.Rare Replay is a huge package perfect for people who are hardcore fans of the old games.  And even new fans who got a taste of Rare and now they want to go back can play all of the games.  Rare Replay gets our rating of Try It.  The slowdown is really a killer on the recent 360 games.  And not every game has perfect controls, although Rare tried very hard to make it accessible.  But it's a ton of fun games in one package overall.  And for the most part these games still hold up ok.  The slowdown and the Xbox 360 emulation is very annoying and I wish that wasn't the case, but it's still a very valuable package.  It's priced fairly at $30 retail which kind of breaks down to a dollar per game.  But you shouldn't really look at it that way.  Rare is such a fan favorite and it's hard to hate on the company for how they've changed.  Hopefully this is a sign that Rare will be returning to their roots with future games.  These games aren't for everyone and some people may not have the same nostalgia.  But for those who do enjoy it, this collection is loads of fun.

"This supplement was provided to me for review.  COQ10 is very beneficial for overall health and even anti-aging.  I take it everyday along with many other health supplements.  It's one of the best antioxidants and helps with preventing heart disease.  It also includes Vitamin A and Vitamin E which are beneficial but not water soluble.  So you have to be very careful about exceeding dosages.  BRI Nutrition makes solid products and I highly recommend their supplements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDLN3S4H7U0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKI2ITG#wasThisHelpful","R2GDLN3S4H7U0Q","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:06 Mins Today, we're unboxing Comfy microfiber salon towel.  This product was provided to me by Comfy Towels.  They're 80% polyster and 20% polyamide with microfiber material.  I always prefer microfiber for towels because they feel soft, absorb liquid well, and are better at picking up dirt.  Testing it out by dripping water on my hands, wrist, and watch, the towel dries off very well.  It would work well at home for hair and body care.  It's soft and it's also a nice large size.  I highly recommend comfy towels for people who want great microfiber towels in their home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZP4RUEY2B52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFGHAOQ#wasThisHelpful","R14ZP4RUEY2B52","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product was provided to me for review.  This formula has a ton of ingredients that increase male virility and that's really important if you're a guy.  I used to take all of these items individually but this supplement is a good combination and at good dosages.  The most important for me is Maca because it provided energy and overall stamina.  Of course HGW is the main ingredient and it's a great libido booster.  Other ingredients are really important such as saw palmetto for the prostate.  Overall, it's really an essential for men to be taking this and I highly recommend alohagenix''s libido booster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFB1NYPTBXTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8R412I#wasThisHelpful","R1EFB1NYPTBXTI","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It comes in a simple plastic package and there's no accessories.  It has a solid metal construction and I can say that overall it's built well.  It also supports a vertical mount if you had to attach to some sort of shelf, but that doesn't fit my setup.  I'll be mounting this on my desk.  This device mounts on the side of your desk and it screws in securely.  I can put my headphones on it and rest them very easily.  I do wish it had something on the edge to prevent your headphones from falling off, but otherwise it's really cheap at $13.99 for a headphone hanger.  I highly recommend this headphone hanger by Brainwavz.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U23XKLS12FW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMBMO06#wasThisHelpful","R2U23XKLS12FW2","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:09 Mins Telltale Games takes us back to Pandora and beyond with Tales From The Borderlands.  It's a mix between the story and gameplay of Gearbox's classic shooter with a few recurring motifs from the Telltale Games style of storytelling.  In this review we're covering episode 3, but this video should apply both to people who are new to the Tales From The Borderlands series as well those who have only played the first episode or two.  I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum, but it's essential to talk about the narrative in this story driven game.  Let's take a look at Tales From The Borderlands and see if it's worth playing.Tales takes place in the Borderlands universe, but unlike the Borderlands games you aren't playing as a Vault Hunter.  You play as Rhys, a Hyperion employee who is trying to work his way to the top of the corporate ladder.  You also control Fiona who is a con artist working on Pandora.  The two characters come together and through unlikely odds become allies.  The story takes place after Borderlands 2 in the wake of  Handsome Jack's demise.  Yet he still has a presence in this game.  Ironically, these non-Vault Hunters turn their primary focuses to finding a Vault.Episode 3 is the middle of this five part series and it definitely shows.  Character development starts to flush out more as everyone tends to reveal more about their past and their motivations.  We also see relationships develop as the characters learn that they have to work together.  Both Fiona and Rhys have to constantly prove that they are the leaders of this operation.  It manages to do all of this while still injecting a little bit of humor at the right times.  It's safe to say that the strong but light hearted humor remains intact from the borderlands series.Conversation branches have long term impacts on how your characters interact as each of them remember your choices and react appropriately.  Your actions can have very different outcomes as I've had certain character become disability or had big changes to their appearance when I made the wrong choices in different playthroughs.  And there are plenty of action sequences with quicktime events.  Most of the action sequences fit in well and keep you engaged.  They prevent you from putting the controller down just because you are listening to some dialogue.  Especially during some crucial moments of the story when you encounter a villain and the game really tests you to act true to your character.The graphics engine of Borderlands is getting dated by this point, but the art style still shines through.  Tales brings a lot more details in the environment as you get close views of everything through the cutscenes.The strong voice acting is probably the best part of the game and it's essential for an interactive story.  Troy Baker lends his classic voice for Rhys and Fiona is voiced by Laura Bailey.  Both veterans of voice acting in games.Tales From The Borderlands is fun, captivating, and manages to draw fans of shooters and interactive stories.  You definitely want to continue playing the series if you haven't picked up episode 3 and if you're new this would be a good time to jump on board and get up to speed.

" 5:32 Mins The classic Devil May Cry 4 game originally released on PS3 and Xbox 360 back in 2008 has returned for the Special Edition by Capcom.  It brings everything we can expect from an HD version with improved graphics and a few new features.  But is it worth picking up an old re-released game for new fans or even for the hardcore Devil May Cry Fans?  Let's find out in the Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Review.We're going to focus primarily on the new additions to the game as I'm sure there's already a lot of reviews on the original Devil May Cry 4.  The clearest improvement in the Special Edition is the graphics upgrade.  It runs in 1080p 60 frames per second on Xbox One and PS4.  The PC version has no frame rate cap and you can definitely crank up the graphics.  It looks crisp, clear, and smooth.  There's still evidence that it's a last gen game from the textures, to the models, and the level design.  But it's definitely a big improvement and it's a necessity for a modern HD remaster.The biggest draw of the Special Edition are the new playable characters.  You can play as Nero and Dante who were in the original version.  But now you can play as Vergil, Trish, and Lady who all have different weapons, handling, and special abilities.  Devil May Cry is all about the playstyle and how you handle the combos.  So playing as different characters definitely adds a new dimension to the game.Players are really excited to play as Vergil who is based on his rendition from Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, combined with elements of his playstyle from DmC.  He has two different swords and special huge fist weapons.  His special abilites has him transform.  He moves fast and his sword play is really precise.  He's really a blast to play as.Then there's Lady and Trish.  Lady specializes in long range firearm based combat.  Her signature weapon is the Kalina Ann which is a huge rocket launcher.  She has a grappling hook which lets her control enemies and also rappel up in certain platforming sections.  She handles much differently from Dante and Nero.  She's more of a ranged weapons character.  Her melee attacks are very slow but deal a decent amount of damage.  Trish utilizes a Sparada Sword and her pistols.Each of the three new characters also receive their own story cutscenes which makes it feel like playing a different character has meaning and it's not just a re-skin.  However Lady can only play on Nero's missions and Trish can only play on Dante's missions.  Vergil can play on any mission.  That's a little confusing, but it keeps the storylines distinct and adds replayability.  For those who really love replaying the levels and grinding for high score, it's definitely a great value to be able to play the different characters.For the really hardcore, there's Legendary Dark Knight mode.  Which is an extremely high difficulty challenge.  They multiply the amount of enemies and also bring in tougher enemies even early in the game.  You can see here side by side the difference in enemy count is huge.  And they are much more aggressive.  You definitely don't want to go in to Legendary Dark Knight Mode without experience and without all of the upgrades.  I couldn't get far in Legendary Dark Knight mode, but I can see how it would be a lot of fun for someone very experienced and it's actually easier to rack up combos since the enemy count is higher.The one downside is the additional DLC.  You're already re-buying an old game and then they want you to spend more money just to unlock new modes and costumes.  This is so unnecessary, these things should really be included with the game.  The whole reason someone would buy this game is to replay levels with new characters and challenges and they put a barrier to that by placing some of that content in the DLC.  And although the game is a pretty good package it's really just an excuse to get this game out on the new consoles.  And to get it out on Steam a second time.  It's kind of ridiculous that the old one is there just five dollars cheaper than the original.Despite those few quarrels I think the game is a good package and Devil May Cry 4 is a fun game that rewards skill.  If you're a hardcore player, the extra characters and legendary dark knight mode add a new dimension of depth.  If you're a new player this could be an easy way to check out the series seeing as it's only about a $25 package depending on whether or not you can justify also purchasing the DLC.  They made right decision keeping the price low and not overcharging for an HD remaster.  So you may want to give Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition a shot.

" 7:12 Mins Batman Arkham Knight has been highly anticipated both by Batman fans and people who just love open world action games.  The last game, Batman Arkham Origins, wasn't as good as people expected and actually had a different developer which played a big role in the game's outcome.  Rocksteady has returned to create the final Batman game in the Arkham series, but does it bring any new improvements and does it make open world gaming fans happy?  Let's find out in the Batman Arkham Knight review.StoryThe Arkham Knight game takes place one year after events from Arkham City where Batman still struggles after his battle with the Joker.  Unfortunately Scarecrow teams up with a new villain, the Arkham Knight, and brings terror back to Gotham with a wave of Fear Gas forcing an evacuation of the city's six million civilians. It's now a city full of criminals and the police force can't stop it.  It's not just Scarecrow and Arkham Knight, they bring in the Penguin, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Firefly, Poison Ivy, and the Riddler to destroy the Dark Knight permanently.  It's not easy being Batman.The Arkham Knight villain is a new rival to Batman who's dedication to killing Batman is incredibly erie.  He's vengeful, but patient and calculating.  Much different from the Joker.New FeaturesThe Arkham Knight game manages to bring a lot of incremental improvements.  The world is significantly bigger.  Rocksteady has claimed that it's actually five times the scale and you can see the difference both on a macro level and on a micro level.  Viewing the game from maps and flying around the city, there's much more to explore.  And then when you're actually running around or driving there's tons of little detailed niche areas.  It's perfect for the new vehicle addition.  You know what vehicle I'm talking about...Yeah! The Batmobile.  I can't believe we went three Arkham games without a Batmobile.  Driving is incredibly fun and offers a different variety of transportation compared to gliding around the city.  It's a great dynamic between speeding on the ground versus flying overhead.  Of course we've all seen it transform from a transportation vehicle into a tank for combat which adds even more variety to the gameplay.  The only big negative that everyone seems to be complaining about are the jumping puzzles involving the Batmobile.  Jumping puzzles are rarely fun and this really seems like filler and a way to add more Batmobile related content to the game.  It's very contradictory.  Although it's nice that the Batmobile has diverse moves, the purpose is to drive fast and blow stuff up.  Adding puzzles takes you out of the core gameplay.CombatIf there's one thing the Arkham series is known for, it's the combat.  The same tactical and methodical combat returns with a few new tweaks and gadgets.  There's surprise multi takedowns for when you want to sneak up on enemies.  You can chain combos across multiple enemies.  The variety of enemies are also improved as some are harder to kill such as the medics.  And you get a performance report after every event which always encourages you to play just a little bit better.A lot of the same atmospheric elements are also still present.  The criminals with casual banter while you lurk in the shadows, radio communication with Batman's team, Batman's exposition statements, and plenty of detective work.GraphicsLet's not forget that this is the first next gen Arkham game and it doesn't disappoint in the graphics department.  When Rocksteady upped the scale of the city, they also upped the detail.  Environments and especially weather effects are really good and keep the immersion factor high.  Another great detail that the series was already known for are the faces.  During cutscenes facial detail and motion are highly believable which, along with the great voice acting, keeps the cinematic feel.  You can easily forget that you are playing a game.  And of course the Batmobile looks glorious.  They nailed the movements and transformations.  The way the suspension and drifting handle make the Batmobile appear like a fast technologically advanced vehicle.  The sense of speed you get is reminiscent of a Need For Speed game, but with much more control over maneuvering.Voice ActingThe voice acting is fantastic, but it's also the same voice actors we loved from the previous Arkham games.  Kevin Conroy returns as Batman and he's played Batman for years now, so he really has the role down well.  And John Noble is menacing as The Scarecrow.They really tried to pack in as much as possible for this Arkham game.  There's so many villains and each of them get their time in the spotlight.  But Batman's not alone because there are plenty of sidekicks.  Robin, Nightwing, and Catwoman fight alongside you and it's great to see them fighting side by side.  There's even team takedowns which are more for fun than practicality.Replay ValueAs with any open world game.  Arkham Knight will keep you busy with plenty of replayability.  There's tons of side missions and even a New Game Plus.  The main story will take you about 12 hours to beat and then there's probably about 40 hours of total gameplay for completionists.ConclusionArkham Knight is a solid game and I don't think anyone had doubts leading up to the release.  It has action, fun, drama, and don't forget the batmobile.  For those who played the previous games and aren't sure if you want to jump back in, there's plenty of new experiences to keep you busy.  Let us know if you think Arkham Knight was a good game and if you think there's potential for a possible new series of superhero games from developer Rocksteady.

" 4:55 Mins The Witcher 3 is one of the most highly anticipated games of 2015.  And by this point we already know that CD Projekt Red knows how to deliver on their RPGs.  The Witcher is a huge game that takes about 37 hours to beat the main story and over 150 hours to 100% complete the game.  We're going over the highlights.  Let's take a closer look at the Witcher 3 and how this game stands out from the crowd in this quick review.The Witcher 3 is a very in depth RPG that's easy to pick up and hard to master.  The tutorial is very step by step and explains all of the complex mechanics that allow you to play the game properly.  But at the same time, it's intuitive.  Even during the first few moments, the game flows well.  From the first hour of the game the story teaches you basic combat and introduces you to the open world.  Objectives are very directed and easy to get to on your horse.  All of these features make the game seamless and that's what makes the Witcher 3 so amazing.  It never takes you out of the gameplay.  You rarely find yourself stuck whether it's due to the lack of directive, the story, or the challenge.  That's why it's one of the game that you can't put down.The story and the world of Witcher is continually pushing the boundaries of immersion.  The Witcher's story is complex, ongoing, and properly woven into the gameplay.  Each cutscene and each mission is very specifically directed and evokes emotion.  The way people react to your character, Geralt,  gets you lost in the story.  You really feel for Geralt and his troubles as being a Witcher.  It's the battle of every hero.  He's got great power, but a lot of responsibility.  People demand him to do dirty work for them, but see him as an outcast and a killer.  And of course Geralt has always been a ladies man, and his romance scenes are a story of their own.  Even conversation trees keep you on your toes and expose the true emotions of the characters.  It's not the type of game where you put your controller down during a cutscene.The graphics in Witcher 3, especially on the PC version, are really top notch.  And it's not just about how many effects it's pushing.  It's the way it's used.  The day/night cycle is the most detailed out of any game.  It literally tells you the time and weather condition in the upper right corner.  And the weather gradually changes from cloudy to rainy to sunny again.  Looking up at the sky, you get lost in how attractive it looks.  Traveling through the world, it really feels alive.  Not just in towns, but even between towns.  On the roads there are small homes, traveling soldiers, and many areas to explore.  It contributes to the seamless nature of The Witcher 3.  Nothing feels like filler.The combat in Witcher 3 is straight up fun.  Who doesn't like swinging a big sword in melee combat?  You engage in close quarter melee combat as well as fighting huge creatures.  You also have spells and potions to modify your attributes.CD Projekt Red is also one of the most honest game devs.  The PC version has no DRM if you purchase on GOG.com.  And they are one of the few publisher who will release a high amount of free DLC.The Witcher 3 is a massive game with high ambitions and it gets almost all of them right.  It's beautiful to look at, it's fun to play and it's accessible to almost anyone.  Unless you are highly averse to RPGs, you definitely want to pick up the Witcher 3 and start slayin!

" 1:33 Mins Today, we're unboxing the Hometek humidifer.  For anyone who doesn't use a humidifer, it increases moisture in the air which is good for dry air problems such as nose bleeds, dry coughing, dry skin, nasal congestion, sinus irritation, and flu symptoms.  It's a must have if you live in a dry desert area like Arizona or if you have really harsh winters where you have to use a lot of dry indoor heat.  It makes a huge difference for most people and greatly improve quality of life.What I like about the humidifer from Hometek is that it's really simple.  It has a small AC adapter that's removeable, a very lightweight base, the water tank, and the mist funnel.  The base is very lightweight and there's not that many parts involved so it's easy to move between rooms within your home.  The tank holds up to 1.6 liters of water which should last an entire day unless you are running it on max.  And it claims to humidify rooms up to 600 square feet.  It outputs cool mist which is great for those dry weather issues I mentioned earlier.  I also like that there are no filters to deal with, cleanup and refilling the tank is simple.  It also doesn't make much noise, you wouldn't notice it unless you put your ear right up to the device.This particular humidifer has an analog control so you can adjust the humidity levels as you see necessary.  It has a nice tall and long swan shape tank with a funnel at the top so it will easily disperse the mist in your room.  And you can point it in any direction.I can highly recommend this humidifer from Hometek because I think humidifers are a home essential and Hometek provides a great affordable solution.-2.2 Litre Tank-Analog Dial-Adjustable Funnel","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGFMLJUZ3SOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSMTOQS#wasThisHelpful","RZGFMLJUZ3SOD","A3G3YT0TVEA147","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G3YT0TVEA147?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:13 Mins LEGO Jurassic World was announced in January 2015 which was only months prior to the release of the game which coincides with the new Jurassic World movie.  This game adapts the plot of all four Jurassic Park films and provides a huge world to explore.  Let's take a look at LEGO Jurassic World and see if it's worth it for fans of both LEGO and Jurassic World series.LEGO Jurassic World follows all of the same LEGO mechanics.  Similar art style, same construction, swapping characters to advance, and a few surprising action scenes.  There's plenty of puzzles and it's an open world, but the game guides you through in a linear story.  I tend to compare this game to LEGO Marvel Heroes and LEGO Batman because they were my favorite and two of the most popular games in the series.  Jurassic World definitely stands out.  Mixing all four Jurassic Park movies is very ambitious, but I would say that they manage to get the story and the world right.The action is significantly different in my experience.  There isn't a ton of combat like in the LEGO Marvel games.  It's more about action and platforming segmented with action sequences.  The action is reserved for certain sequences where characters must escape from dinosaurs or perform a daring rescue.  And you do actually get to control some dinosaurs to overcome obstacles.It's a very comprehensive game and it captures the essence of all the different characters, with one exception.  They use the original audio from some of the older movies which on the one hand is nostalgic and on the other hand it seems out of place.  The problem comes from the fact that the audio quality is significantly dated and it seems like they are working with the mixed down version.  In other words, you hear too much background noise from the original movie.  It's not a deal breaker, but it definitely took me out of the moment during some cutscenes.The graphics are surprisingly good for a LEGO game.  The character models look the same as the previous games, but the environments are much more dynamic.  The way they hand,led the various swamps and jungles of the island goes beyond the last few LEGO games.  The environment looks more realistic than the characters, but it's still balanced.The cutscenes and some of the action sequences are really cool and reminiscent of the movies.  There's the crazy chase scenes, the small groups of dinosaurs, and you really get the sense of people discovering the world of dinosaurs.The humor is also a little more mature for a LEGO game.  There's plenty of comedy, but the game let's the world and the characters provide the humor rather than pushing numerous puns in every single cutscene.Of course with any LEGO game it has a few extensive features.  The game is a collect-athon with a million different things to capture for replayability in free play mode.  You could easily spend 40 hours chasing after every last widget if you want.  And the game is very accessible.  It's on previous gen and last gen consoles, PC, and even the handhelds - the Vita and 3DS.LEGO Jurassic World can provide some enjoyment if you don't want such an intensive game or you really want to engross yourself in the revitalization of Jurassic World.  So you may as well Try It.  For the hardcore players out there, this game has been released in between Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight so you may want to reserve your cash for a bigger game.

"This book started off really good. You see what Righteous’ life has been like. She’s in the principal’s office for throwing soda on another girl. You sense right then and there that Righteous has been in the hot seat before and isn’t intimidated by the principal. When she goes home, her mother’s boyfriend is roughing up her mom. So when she tries to get him to leave her mother alone and to leave the trailer, he attacks her instead. Well, of course when the cops show up, the mother doesn’t want to press charges and claims it was all her fault the altercation even happened. That is our introduction into Righteous' life.Righteous likes to be left alone. Don’t get her confused for someone who wants friends but is the odd kid out. Not only does the new kid try to converse with Righteous, but there is another girl at school who apparently asks her just about every day if she wants to eat lunch with her; Righteous blows her off every time. However, there is one person in her life that she can count on and that’s Magda. An old lady with dementia whom she met while walking through the park. Apparently Magda got out of her nursing home and Righteous helped her find her way back. They’ve been friends ever since. In fact Magda is Righteous’ only friend.The entire book is written in Righteous’ point of view and at times it was rough for me to get through. There is a lot of internal dialog. A lot. Which I suppose makes sense because she pushes everyone away and has no other friends except for Magda. There were times where her ramblings about the “Pops” or “Popsicles” (popular kids), her musings about her dead end life, her negligent mother who cared more about men than her, and the new kid who is following her around wanting to be her friend, became a little exhausting.I liked that the author gave Righteous struggles. None of it was really over the top. There are people out there who struggle like Righteous and her mother did. My huge gripe though is what happens towards the end. It left me wondering why the author flipped course like that. The story was enjoyable up until that point. Then I just felt like I was reading an entirely different book all together. As if maybe I have fallen into Righteous’ parallel universe or something.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C1N5IV6EYTJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DA5DFNG#wasThisHelpful","R3C1N5IV6EYTJL","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Nobody’s Hero we pick up right where Nobody’s Angel left off. (No you can’t just jump into this book, you have to go in order)I really enjoyed their story. I found it to be a bit long and drawn out in some places which really took away from the story for me but as a whole, but I really enjoyed the story itself and am looking forward to the rest of the series. There is a good amount of backbone to this erotica. It’s not just all sex, but I’m not going to lie, the sex is good. I liked that you got a feel for the characters and the story didn’t just revolve around the two main characters but also included a mix of others as well as various points of interest between the two MCs. For instance, Adam not only has to deal with Karla but his late wife and his childhood past. Meanwhile, things happen with the other characters of Master At Arms and Adam and Karla find themselves helping out their friends and family. So even though a lot of the story is about Karla trying to get Adam to open up to her, there is a lot of other things that take place as well. Like I said, I will definitely be keeping up with this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNS2AIGBS5XLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PA7UJS#wasThisHelpful","RNS2AIGBS5XLN","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really enjoyable book to read. It had just what I was looking for in a book at the time. I needed adventure with a hint of romance and I got that. There’s even a little bit or magic/fantasy/paranormal stuff going on as well. I will definitely be picking up the second book to see what is in store for Celaena. She’s an interesting character and I’m curious to see what life has in store for her.Celaena is a well-known assassin. She was the best one out there until she was caught and sent to the mines to serve out her sentence. Now, you may be thinking the that the mines don’t seem like that big of a deal but it’s pretty much a death sentence. People don’t last more than a month in the mines and woman barely see half that time. Unfortunately, woman are brutalized down there by the overseers. Although Celaena was never raped, thanks to the fear she caused in everyone, she was mistreated. She was starved, beaten, and whipped on a regular basis. When the Captain of the Guard (Chaol) comes to escort her out of the mines, her state of health if not overlooked. She’s frail, pale, brittle dull hair, covered in blood, dirt, and grime, and has tattered clothes that are falling off of her body. She has no idea why the Captain of the Guard has shown up. She assumes it’s her execution day. However, it’s actually the start of a new beginning. The King is in need of a Champion. Someone who will get their hands bloody and do his dirty work for him. He has issued a competition where his council can select a champion of their choosing and they will all battle it out until only one remains. That champion will serve their time under his rule and then will be let free. The prince has chosen Celaena as his champion for the competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38P0PUI6QXXQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140883233X#wasThisHelpful","R38P0PUI6QXXQ2","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this at the store the other day and decided to give it a try. I liked the idea of an all organic toner that wasn't tested on animals. Plus, the orange smell was really nice. However, after washing my face and applying the toner I realized it was not for me. After about 5 minutes or so my face started to heat up. Sort of like after a workout or when you're out in the sun too long. I started to sweat and something told me to look in the mirror. What I saw were red splotches all over my face. I quickly rinsed it off and after a while the redness went away but it's definitely not something I want to happen again. This toner was the only change in my regimen. I've read a lot of raving reviews and my face is usually never sensitive but it did not react well with this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB6XWR1HU9NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001211B0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1OB6XWR1HU9NK","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For being a short story, I thought it was good. However, I had a little bit of a problem with Tess and the reasoning behind why she left her husband in the first place. I guess with me being a military wife, I expect long nights and days where my husband doesn’t come home. It is part of the job. So for Tess to leave Nat because he was spending too much time at work just didn’t seem like a good enough reason for me. With that being said though, I did find that the story was entertaining for being as short as it was. There wasn’t a lot of information dumping, just short recaps of what went wrong.The only characters that were in this book are Tess and Nat. The story starts off with them in the airport and goes straight to them landing on a deserted island. The entire book is about Nate trying to win back his ex-wife. I liked Nat and his persistence, no matter how many times she pushed him away he always came back trying harder. Even though I didn’t feel like the marriage falling apart was his fault, he really manned up and took responsibility and tried to show her that he was a changed man.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRB3URV1ZUY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JSJTQO#wasThisHelpful","R3QRB3URV1ZUY4","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michelle's grandfather looked after her growing up because her mother was clearly not capable of doing so. She either doesn't show up at all or shows up high out of her mind. So, Michelle's grandfather has raised her and looked after her. However, when Michelle is 14 her loving grandfather passes away and her unloving mother kicks her out of the house. With only $80 on her, Michelle gets on a bus to New York. A place where a friend of hers from school claimed to be moving to. Pretty soon, Michelle finds herself broke, with nowhere and no one to turn to, other than the nice man who bought her food at the bus station. He takes her home where she meets two other girls. One in her late teens, and another only 12. Michelle has no idea what she's gotten into until it's too late. Pretty soon she's one of them and they are all calling her Little Peach.""I wonder if Grandpa can see me. If maybe he sent Devon to make sure I could get away.""This was one of those stories that was gut-wrenching to read. The story jumps between Peach in the hospital and the events leading up to her trip to the hospital. The story is written in Peach's perspective. So with that being said, the story is choppy, shallow, and not that well written. However, this is from a 14 year old girl's perspective. So it would stand to reason that she wouldn't be able to articulate herself like an adult would and may have jumbled memories and thoughts. So when you look at it that way, the story was written perfectly.During the day, Peach, Kat, Baby, and Daddy (Devon) hang out at the apartment watching T.V. They are like a normal make-shift family. However, at night, Daddy loads the kids up and takes them to a hotel where each girl gets her own room. While there the girls wait in their room for the customers to show up while the Daddy's stay outside and run the business. Thankfully, the author doesn't go into explicit detail in what happens in those rooms but they are some horribly disturbing scenes nonetheless. Devon gives the girls a false sense of security. He's checks in on Peach after her shift is over, coddles them, and pretends to be their father or older brother. He's there for them if any of the customers get too rough. However, Peach has no idea what lurks beneath until it's too late. She has no idea that the moment his name was tattooed on her chest that she belonged not only to him but a whole gang of people, and not in a good way.This is one of those books that should be read. Everyone should open their eyes to what goes on in our own country, our own city, our own neighborhood. This isn't something that happens in movies, on T.V., or in some foreign country. This is happening in our own backyards and it needs to be stopped. This book will get your right in the heart. You will mourn for the loss of their childhood, for the things that they have to endure to survive, and the hope that has been scared out of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SASZRQ2CKQP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L19DUJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1SASZRQ2CKQP1","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe because I read the prequel, Shadows, I wasn't surprised by anything that happened in this book. I knew Daemon was a Luxen and I understood his hatred and down right rudeness towards Katy. After all, it was a female human who was the cause of his brother's death. So when Katy rolls into town, actually right next door, and makes friends with Daemon's sister Dee, he is livid. He doesn't want his sister getting close to Katy for fear that there will be repercussions. However, it's Daemon who ends up getting too close to Katy which poses the hugest problem of all. He's lead the Amun's right to their door.Like I said, the book didn't have any mystery for me since I read Shadows. However, I still really enjoyed the story. I really liked Katy's character. I rarely say this about a character but I saw a lot of myself in Katy. The fact that she gets creeped out by kids, her sassiness and the fact that she's not above proving a point... even if it is a bad choice on her point. Oh and of course every blogger is going to point this out but c'mon, she's a book blogger for goodness sake! She talks about posting her Waiting on Wednesday post and her weekly wrap up of books that she got for the week. So of course Katy is going to connect with book bloggers universally on that aspect. I just really liked her character. That's not saying that I didn't like the other characters but I just really liked Katy.Again, I'm a fan of the author's writing style. She knows how to connect with the younger crowd. She doesn't use outdated words or phrases that people were saying back in the 90's. Which by the way is my hugest pet peeve about YA novels. The author always writes the characters the way they think they should behave as apposed to the way teenagers act now a days. There is drinking in this novel, hot and heavy make out sessions, and mention of sex. And to me, keeping real to the way teens truly are, always wins major bonus points!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34J1RXVWIPJT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620610078#wasThisHelpful","R34J1RXVWIPJT2","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keelin’s parents have always hovered over her and never allowed her any breathing room. Then she was forced into protective hibernation only to wake up and realize that her parents were still hibernating. She sets off and tries to find the independence she’s been craving. The only problem is, there’s an Alpha dragon who has been sniffing around her and seems to think she’s his mate. No matter how many times she gives him the cold shoulder, he doesn’t seem to take the hint. And now he’s shown up at her new location.This was a great story that revolved around Keelin and Bran. Granted, we meet the two of them in the previous book (The male MC is Keelin’s long lost brother), the author still adds a lot of history that takes place after the last book that helps bring you up to speed about these two characters relationship. Sure, you can read these books by themselves but all the characters from the previous two books are always buzzing around in this one. So with reading the previous two, it’s like a cozy dragon family reunion.The author wrote this book in a handful of character’s perspectives. However, unlike the last book, I was never lost. You follow the two main characters, the villain, and two of the secondary characters which I’m sure will be seeing their own book very soon. We have met Bo previously since his club had been in the previous books but we got to know him a little bit more with the few chapters that were written in his point of view. Not to mention his love interest who is an innocent employee of his. A female who is definitely “other” but no one is quite sure what exactly she is. Of course, it’s revealed in this story but I’m not about to give away any spoilers. With their stories mixed in, and the fact that they have some drama going on that will more than likely come back to bite them in the behind… I’m confident their story will be next. And I cannot wait.Back to the main characters though. Bran and Keelin were interesting characters to read from. Sure Bran is your typical Alpha. He’s powerful, full of himself, and is uber protective of his female. However, he was born with a deformity that has left him viewing life reminiscent of the Beast from Beauty and the Beast. He was born blind in one eye. That same eye is cloudy and looks different from the other. With the fact that dragons are known to be a “beautiful” species, his ruggedness isn’t something that’s normally sought after. So he has some insecurities about his deformity. I think that little nugget was what set Bran apart from other Alpha’s for me. He wasn’t winy or “woah is me”, but he definitely felt hurt when he thought Keelin didn’t want him because of his disability.Keelin was one of those characters that wants to be free. She’s been sheltered all her life and she’s ready to get out and live a little. The only problem is that when she sets out to establish her independence a dominant male comes charging in threatening it. I like that even though her dragon was clawing at her to mate with Bran, she didn’t cave on what she wanted. She wanted to have a little fun and live a little. Granted, she got a little more than she bargained for but she stuck with what she wanted. She didn’t fully push Bran away though, she lays it all out on the table, they can hook up and fool around but she does not want to be mated. I really respected her for standing up for what she wanted and not backing down.This was a great addition to the series. Not only were the main characters a pleasure to read but I liked seeing all the other characters coming back into the mix. It was nice seeing everyone again. I think this will be one of those series that I keep up with. It’s got dragons, romance, and suspenseful fight scenes. I mean, what more could a paranormal romance junkie ask for?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7C7A05E8Y9SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGQ2YAY#wasThisHelpful","R7C7A05E8Y9SD","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five years ago their father left to start a new life with a new family. Five years ago their mother checked out on them. Five years ago Maya and Lochan grew up beyond their years and took over the house. They fed their three younger siblings, changed their diapers, dropped them off to school, picked them up, and took care of them. They became the parents, the guardians.My thoughts are thoroughly conflicted over this book. I’m not sure I will be able to write a coherent review but I’m going to try. It was such a compelling story that I couldn’t put it down, no matter how uncomfortable it made me. You see, it’s not just about two siblings falling in love. There is a lot of build up to that. They start off as normal siblings. However, when Maya goes on a date, Lochan loses his cool and realizes that his feelings for his sister run deeper than that of a brother. He tries everything he can to push her away and to get his head screwed on right. He researches incest to see if they are the only ones out there who fell in love. He is so conflicted over how he feels. Their romance didn’t just start, you could see it building, and the turmoil it caused within them.“I am a person coming undone. I am so disgusted with myself that I want to crawl out of my own skin. My mind keeps pulling me back to that dance. Maya, her face, her touch, that feeling. I keep telling myself these things happen – I’m sure they are not all that uncommon. After all, I’m a seventeen-year-old guy – anything can set us off. Just because it happened while I was dancing with Maya doesn’t mean a thing. But the words do little to reassure me.”Lochan was by far the most interesting character out of the two. He has this speech phobia. He just cannot seem to talk to other people other than his family. He’s extremely smart and does well in school, but when it comes to answering questions or giving oral presentations, he can’t do it. His teachers are all well aware of this and have made sure to leave him be and not call on him during class. The kids at school have already come to terms with the weird boy who doesn’t speak. There were a couple scenes in the book where he does actually speak to others but it’s so painful to watch. You can just feel how uncomfortable he is and no one knows why he’s like that.“I see myself configured in their eyes: the guy who always buries himself at the very back of every class, who never speaks, always sits alone in one of the outdoor stairwells during break, hunched over a book. The guy who doesn’t know how to talk to people, who shakes his head when picked on in class, who is absent whenever there is some kind of presentation to do. Over the years they have learned just to let me be.”The story isn’t told in just Lochan’s POV though. We also follow Maya during this time as well. I must say, she was definitely the aggressor when it came to the relationship blossoming. She sees Lochan’s turmoil, knows why he’s pulling away from her and she confronts him about it. She doesn’t understand why two people who are in love can’t be together, regardless of the circumstances. She pushes the envelope with Lochan little by little. However, she is also conflicted with the whole thing. She tries to figure out why she feels this way for her brother. How it happened. Why it happened. She even goes out with another guy in the hopes of snapping herself out of it.“Why, then – why is it so different with Lochan? But the answer is simple: because Lochan has never felt like a brother. Neither an annoying younger one nor a bossy older one. He and I have always been equals. We’ve been best friends since we were toddlers. We’ve shared a bond closer than friendship all our lives. Together we’ve brought up Kit, Tiffin, and Willa. We’ve cried together and comforted each other. We’ve each seen the other at our most vulnerable. We’ve shared a burden inexplicable to the outside world. We’ve been there for each other – as friends, as partners.”Like I said before, this was such a conflicting book. I mean, I cannot wrap my head around it. It made me feel so many emotions. I was sickened, sad, hopeful, outraged, confused, and in the end heartbroken. This story had me crying at the end. I mean, these two teenagers go through a lot of crap. I’m not talking about the whole, “Whoa is me” crap that a lot of teen characters are going through in books. I think the one thing I loved and hated about this story was the ending. I’m still reeling from the way the author ended the story. So much love, so much heartache. Gah!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1NL39QUEE02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004A90A9I#wasThisHelpful","R1E1NL39QUEE02","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It doesn't have any scent to it which is nice. However, I have a spastic cat and a cat who started peeing outside of the litter box in one particular spot. I took them both to the vet, had tests run, and the results came back normal. So the vet recommended I get not only the spray but the diffuser as well. I sprayed around the litter box, the spot outside of the litter box that my one kept peeing at, and all areas that they spend the majority of their time. It didn't do anything for either of them. My one is still a spaz and my other cat continued to pee in that one spot until the day she passed away. It was worth a try though. This is one of those things that may work for some but not all cats. Just so happened that it didn't work for my two girls.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJ4QI201RQ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GQI8SS#wasThisHelpful","R1AJ4QI201RQ4X","A1K5LVT31CG1IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5LVT31CG1IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like that it is machine washable and I have put it through the laundry twice to test it (normal cycle wash and permanent press drying). It held up well with no noticeable shrinkage, but some slight edge curling.It is not very soft, but it is very absorbent. If it gets very wet, it takes days to dry if left on the floor. I recommend tossing it in the dryer or hanging it over the shower rod (both work fine). The top side is bumpy and provides a foot massage. The floor side is smoother.

"In reviewing this shaver I compared it head-to-head with the Panasonic ES-LV81 and the Braun CoolTec CT5. Both have been previously reviewed by me.The Panasonic ES-LV81 remains my favorite shaver, but in one way, the ES-RT97-S wins out – the cartridge-less and tank-less cleaning system.The ES-RT97 provides a very close shave. It is better than the Braun and just as good as the ES-LV-81, which surprised me since the ES-LV-81 has 5 cutting surfaces compared to the ES-RT97’s 3 cutting surfaces. The ES-RT97 caused more irritation, and the handle vibrates more than I like.The main advantage is the cartridge-less cleaning system. I like not having to store bulky replacement cartridges. You are advised to purchase OEM cleaning solution pouches, which end up costing the same as cartridges. I also have had a lot of difficulty cleaning the crud (mostly congealed detergent) out of the tank of the ES-LV-81. Doing so is almost impossible. The ES-RT97 has a tank-less as well as cartridge-less system, which means the innards can be easily maintained.Pros1. Provides a good, close shave with moderate irritation.2. The entire system can be cleaned easily including the water storage tank3. Light weight and portable (without the cleaning station)4. Can be charged in the cleaning station or by directly connecting the handle to the transformer5. Good ergonomics6. No cleaning cartridges.Cons1. You can’t operate it while the handle is attached to the transformer. You must charge it and use it cordless.2. OEM packets of cleaning solution seem over priced ($11 for 3)3. Shaving head only pivots side to side (but this may actually improve control of the shaving head).4. Cryptic status lights5. Too much handle vibration.6. When removing the comb attachment, the foil head seems to also come off as well.7. Filling reservoir and installing it can be very messy.In conclusion, the ES-RT97 will not l replace my ES-LV-81. The irritation would have to be less and the handle vibration is annoying. But the cleaning system is superior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DDPQ9J7VDH5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R3DDPQ9J7VDH5H","AGVDI7RLT24WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGVDI7RLT24WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an electric toothbrush skeptic. I just thought I would get that out of the way. My wife, however, is a true believer and assisted in reviewing this item.It does seem to provide a good cleaning. The handle is reasonably comfortable. The brushed metal design looks modern. The brush heads go on and come off easily. The induction charger works well and battery life is good. It comes with 2 brush heads (one of which seems to be a child size).The quadrant brushing timer (lets you know when to move from top right, to top left, etc) is a nice feature. The pressure sensor didn't seem necessary, but maybe some people need this feature. The ""clean vs. white vs. deep clean"" setting seems to me to be a confusing gimmick. I can tell what the intensity (low, medium and high) settings do, but nowhere could I find how the 3 cleaning modes are actually different. They feel different, but I couldn't tell what was different. They seemed to just be another way to vary the intensity of the vibration.One other issue is the buttons on the handle. Although they have to be sealed for the device not to short out, there is a gap around each button into which gets toothpaste and water. This makes cleaning the handle unnecessarily annoying. Our other electric toothbrush set has sealed membrane buttons that make cleaning much easier. I'm worried this unit will eventually develop a mildew problem around the buttons.Finally, list price is $180. Wow! That's a lot of money for something that may not even be necessary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3BFW5MS5OAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","RS3BFW5MS5OAR","AGVDI7RLT24WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGVDI7RLT24WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well engineered mechanical toy that both my 3 year old daughter and 6 year old son like. It consists of a mechanical horse that walks. The most interesting feature is the doll's ability to mount the horse automatically. Her arm fits in a spring loaded mechanism and when you activate the horse, the spring flips her onto the horse. It works 9 out of ten times once you know how to set it up. My 6 year old eventually was able to get it to work. The doll is specifically made for the horse and is not much use separately due to the special hip joints. She does not stand on her own. The horse can be used on its own. The doll and horse have taken quite a bit of abuse and have not broken yet. The horse does not walk well on any type of carpet (it falls over).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4DAIPR2T63R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3VXZQC#wasThisHelpful","R1V4DAIPR2T63R","AGVDI7RLT24WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGVDI7RLT24WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very simple retro-style game. Great for a deck or backyard, but you need something from which to hang the string with the ring.The wood plaque looks better in the photos on Amazon than it does in real life, and the plaque is actually unnecessary. You could play the same game with a few bucks worth of hardware (hook, ring, string - that's it).If you follow the directions, which are scant, the ring will not catch on the hook. You have to give it a little more slack, but not too much. Set up was a little tedious, diminishing the claim that it is portable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RON3BBNZ1JIUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBIY348#wasThisHelpful","RON3BBNZ1JIUC","AGVDI7RLT24WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGVDI7RLT24WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice medium sized backpack. Great for overnight and weekend treks,  but too small for longer-term backpacking.The pack looks great and seems very well made.The main compartment has a side access zipper and there is a secondary compartment that I like to use for clothes due to be washed. Lots of small pouches are scattered around the pack.The straps are fairly easy to adjust and once adjusted it is very comfortable. The adjustment instructions make it seem more complicated than it is.

"This is a complete archery set with 2 bows, 8 suction cup ""arrows,"" and a target. It is very easy to nock to arrows. Each arrow has two barbs that attach to bungee cords on the bow. The arrows release easily and fly straight, although not very far (about 30 ft). The light up feature on the arrows is nice, but underwhelming. A flashing option would have been better.Everything is well made and solid. The target can be hung or stood up using the included feet.The main problem is that the arrows don't stick well. Unless the strike head on, they won't stick even to the target. They stick poorly to other smooth surfaces. When they do stick (even to the target) they tend to fall off after less than one minute. This is the primary reason for the 3 star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGC727R0QZ2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T66JQH2#wasThisHelpful","R2FGC727R0QZ2R","AGVDI7RLT24WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGVDI7RLT24WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The unit moves a good amount of air, but on the highest setting it is a little loud. There are 4 fan speed setting and a timer function. The lowest 2 settings are fairly quiet. The unit also provides filter replacement reminders.I tested the unit in a basement family room  (20 x 10) that gets slightly musty and causes my eyes to itch. After 2 weeks of continuous use on the highest setting, the musty odor was only slightly decreased, but eye irritation stopped. I am impressed. The carbon filters have already picked up a noticeable amount of dust.Set up was easy; just pop in the filters. The unit is fairly large. It can be positioned to blow the clean air up, or to the side. The unit cannot be positioned to lie flat (with the intake pointed up) because this would crimp the power cord. Too bad.

This is my first clear case and I actually appreciate being able to see the Apple design of my phone through the case, but the texture on the clear part detracts from this.

"This could have been much better, and for $30-40 it should have been.Assembly was frustrating. Part of the problem was that there are creases in the cardboard so it could be folded up inside its own box, but these creases are not part of the final rocket and it kept bending at these creases during assembly. It does not stay together using just its tabs and slots, but some clear packing tape solved this problem nicely.The door started to rip during assembly and continued to rip with play. The bottom of the door frame ripped off after 45 minutes of play and unfortunately is important for stability.The concept is nice and my children love it. They like drawing on it and playing inside of it. It does not hold up well to two kids fighting over who goes inside and even less so when they both get inside.The markers are very nice. Each has two different points, one on each end. There are 6 different colors. They are somewhat washable. 90% came off of cotton pants in the washing machine. 50% came off of skin with soap and water. They do not wash off flat (porous) wall paint (be warned).

"I confess, I totally accidentally found this author simply because of the title of this book. I'm a Rockstar Romance junkie and I guessed by the title that I might find a rockstar inside. Well, it was my lucky day because I loved this book. Now that Riley Edgewood is on my radar, I'll be stalking her.The story is told from Cassidy's POV. She's a college student that is on summer break. She is home from college and goes to a concert with her best friend who has won VIP tickets. This venue is where she sees Gage for the first time. He's playing the guitar and singing on stage. Both girls determine that he is easy on the eyes and the ears. Due to circumstances beyond her control she ends up spending an extended period of time at the VIP bar, hanging with the staff, drinking and laughing and drooling over Gage.She shares, much more than she intended, with various people that night. Isn't that how it works when you get drunk? You lose your filter, and everything you think actually comes out of your mouth. Who knew that crazy night could end up bringing her a job offer? Who knew that letting out those feelings would make her realize that maybe she wanted something different? Too bad that drunk courage wasn't something that she could use when facing her father. There are so many students that would kill to have the opportunity being offered to her. She should be excited and grateful, right? Then why is she feeling sad instead?Cassidy has some very definite opinions about good music. She knows what she likes and what she doesn't. When her girlfriends go on and on and on about Luca, the international heartthrob, she just rolls her eyes. She tells everyone who will listen that she doesn't like his music, even him. Well, that is after she regains the use of her vocal chords. They kinda get frozen when he walks into the room and she sees him in person. She now totally understands what all the hype is about now. He's H-O-T!""His abs belong in the realm of ridiculous--and he knows it.""Her summer was sweaty and hot--and not just the weather. She made some new friends, and some new enemies. She won some battles, and she lost some battles. She found love, and she lost it... She laughed, she cried, she screamed (in both anger and passion). She made some hard decisions, some good and some bad. Some of her choices led to heartache and pain, and others brought her a happiness that she was afraid to claim.

"Who can resist a sweaty, sexy, muscled MMA cage fighter? Not me obviously cuz I grabbed this book after seeing the cover and reading the synopsis. Even though I knew what was coming, actually reading, in detail, that final fight that knocked Rory ""Knockout"" Kavanagh out was brutal. He had my sympathy and my support...for a while. When he started and continued to make bad choices I joined the Kavanagh clan in being worried that he was throwing his life away, stuck on stupid.Speaking of the Kavanaghs, you are gonna love them. They are a big Irish family that loves unconditionally and refuses to mind their own business. That is exactly what is needed, but not necessarily appreciated, at least initially. Just ask Quinn who seems to be constantly on the receiving end of a slap upside the back of his head. And Rory who is walking around, make that limping around, with a huge chip on his shoulder. He's still in pain and unable to resume his fighting career. He's got anger issues and he's avoiding his family because he doesn't want to face their disapproval and judgement regarding his coping mechanisms. He prefers to stay numb and alone. Well, let me clarify, ""He didn't want a relationship--he just wanted to screw and move on.""Clare is running. I knew that going in, but I didn't know what she was running from. Even though the author put me in her head, privy to her thoughts. Apparently she chose not to think about the things I wanted to know because I was anxiously flipping the pages of my kindle waiting for the answers to show up on my next swipe. So of course my imagination came up with all kinds of scenarios. I kept waiting for her past to catch up with her. I kept telling her to share her secrets with Rory. I kept telling her to kick her boss in the nuts because he deserved it. As usual, the characters in the book ignored my thoughtful suggestions. But that doesn't stop me, I'm eternally optimistic and confident that my advice is worth listening to.I especially enjoyed Casey, she's actually my favorite character and I hope she gets her own book. Other than the mother of the Kavanaghs, she is the only other female. And since the family owns Legends, the gym where the MMA cage fighting events are held, you can bet that she's feisty and not afraid to speak her mind. She knows she has the support of her very well respected, and sometimes feared, family. And did I mention that she teaches self-defense classes to women? That's how Clare and Casey meet, when she signs up for a class. Now it has you thinking too, huh? You are wondering what happened to Clare to make her so secretive, aren't you? You want to know why she needs to defend herself, right? You wanna know how many Kavanagh brothers there are and if they are all hot, huh? I'm not saying, but I will tell you that there are a set of twins.

"Softer Than Steel was my introduction to Jessica Topper. Even though this is the second book in the Love & Steel Series, I read it as a standalone. I assumed that like most rockstar romance series that each band member would get their own book and I could catch up later. And I was right, it was a fully-fleshed-out story and I don't feel like I missed anything. Yes, there was an existing relationship that I'm aware came together in the first book, but if anything I learned just enough to make me intrigued for more details.While I enjoyed many things about this story it took some adjusting for my expectations to stop interrupting my reading experience. I'm a Texas girl who reads lots of rocker romance so I was mentally geared for sex, drugs, and rock n' roll with groupies and alcohol and explicit language. While not a bad thing, it took some getting used to, because it was written with a British formality, that kind of felt like a contradiction to the loud in-your-face rockstar lifestyle I'm used to. It still had all the music industry details I dig. There were concerts, song writing, recording, media issues, record label drama, and band bickering to keep my smiling. And one of my favorite things that not every author is talented enough to excel at, but this author aced, was meaningful song lyrics.The characters were believable and entertaining with witty banter and heartfelt expressiveness. I found the yoga aspect interesting, and informational (maybe a touch too much), but also therapeutic and very sensual.The story is told from multiple POV's and the author took me back in time on occasion, through the memories of the characters, to fill in some blanks. It helped me to understand Rick's (aka Riff's) pain and some of the tension between the band members. And even though I was reading from both POV's, the author kept a few secrets to make it interesting. She would drop subtle hints, put ideas in my head, making me wonder and guess as I anticipated a particular outcome. It was exciting to hope and to wait as the suspense built gradually. It takes a while to get there but let me reassure those readers that require an HEA that all the details will eventually come together and get tied up nicely...with a bright orange bow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCBDX17P47NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3GARZM#wasThisHelpful","R1OCBDX17P47NZ","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chelle Bliss fans are gonna be in a one-click Frisco frenzy when this treasure is released. The story is told from his POV and I fell in love with him just by being inside his head. He's the real thing. All those good things that us women want in a man. He's cocky and confident, sexy and skilled, caveman and caring. He's got muscles and tattoos and…um…something special.Too bad all that deliciousness is being wasted on one-night-stands. He's a disillusioned mess and has no desire for a relationship. After seeing so much cheating in his job as a PI and through personal experience he doesn't have much hope for finding love. However; he can't help but notice what a treasure City has found in his Sunshine. All the ALFA PI guys love her. They find it very amusing that she retains her innocence after spending so much time in their presence. They tease her endlessly and find it very amusing if a cuss word ever passes her lips. But what are the chances of him ever finding someone like that?Being the sweetheart that she is, Sunshine wants everyone else to be happy too. So, of course she's gonna attempt matchmaking, right? Where else would you expect to find a sexy, too young bombshell, but at a little girls pink princess party? Can you imagine seeing a bartender in a pink tuxedo? *giggle-snort* Frisco has no intention of dating anyone, especially someone who is good friends with Suzy. I mean really, how could he kick her out in the morning and it not get back to Suzy…and then City… and then all of his friends. There would be no walking away from that without baggage, right? So that's a bad idea he plans to avoid at all costs. Good luck with that, right?Georgia is on his mind, like the song, running endlessly on repeat. He's determined that he's too old for her. He's not good enough for her. She's a good girl. He's a bad boy. He wants her, but he doesn't deserve her. And then he almost lost her…Look out, it gets even better. Get ready for some suspense as the PI's do their thing. Get ready for some laughter as the PI's do their thing. Get ready for friends and family to meddle, it's their thing. Get ready for some action, in and out of the bedroom. (wink-wink) Get ready to smile and sigh as your heart is touched and you become even more attached to this incredible series.

"Being a music lover I couldn't resist giving this book a try after reading the synopsis. And yeah, I really wanted to meet Hank the hound too. It was a very short but interesting read. The characters had personality and the banter was witty. I found myself rooting for poor CeCe who had hit hard times in an explosive way. She wasn't eased into it, she landed hard. Fortunately, Holden and Thomas showed up in the nick of time to offer her and Hank Junior a ride to Nashville. There was just enough good stuff to keep me intrigued as I impatiently wait for the next installment to be released. I have questions...and fantasies that have yet to be fulfilled.

"I'm totally addicted to the Brothers by Blood MC and their women Harmony & Chelsea. After reading this latest book, there are even more characters that I'm drawn to and want to see more of. I agree that, ""The loyalty and love you found within this group was unrivaled."" They are a family that have each other's backs, and that includes the club girls. I found the idea of a MC Romance told from the POV of a club girl to be very intriguing. I was not disappointed, I was impressed. The stories are told in such a way that the reader is drawn in, becoming part of the drama taking place. It's a nail biting, page turning, brow raising experience that you don't want to miss.Chelsea came from foster care, a product of the system. She lost her parents at an early age and was passed from one bad foster home to the next until she finally reached legal age. Her mother told her to run, and she's been doing it ever since. While some might judge her for her choice to become a club girl, she doesn't care. She's found more love and acceptance from these big bossy bikers than she ever received growing up. She's a survivor, doing what has to be done to make it in hard times. She's determined to carve a better future for herself. She's following the rules, doing what she needs to do in exchange for protection and college tuition. The club is taking care of her, and she is taking care of them. But what she really wants, is to just take care of HIM...to be HIS. But, it's been years, and Optimus hasn't claimed her. She's almost got her degree and soon it will be time to move on.Optimus hasn't claimed Chelsea, but he favors her. Everyone knows that, except her. The other brothers are leaving her alone, because they know she is HIS. That's the problem though. He keeps her at arms length, knowing that being associated with him would put her in danger. She doesn't know that he does it for her protection. He can't let her know how he feels. Her safety is what's important, right? What if withholding his feelings, and pushing her away, sends her into the arms of another man? What if she runs again? How can he keep her safe if she's not with him?And then...it gets really good! Then there is action, suspense, betrayal, danger...and death. Who can she trust? Who is telling the truth? Who's gonna be next? Where's the popcorn? When will the next book be released and who's it gonna about? There are a few brothers that need a good woman...I'm predicting Wrench & Sugar will get together, at least I hope so. And then there's Blizzard & Rose...what do you think, maybe? I can't wait to find out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KSZ551AWCPLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OS4436#wasThisHelpful","R2KSZ551AWCPLZ","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is getting better with each book. I'm getting very attached to the characters which include the Savage Angels MC family, their family members, the local citizens that make up the small town of Tourmaline, and the band members that Dave manages. It's hard not to since the author writes in multiple POV, and she doesn't skimp with the multiples... Spending time inside the head of so many characters allowed me to see the relationships and events that took place from several different angles.Dane & Kat (my favorite couple) have been together for a while and are finally planning their big day. Due to Kat's fame and the their large circle of friends and family the event is gonna be spectacular and very, very, huge. The details are taking all of Kat's time and energy and the increased media attention means that she needs extra security. We all know what that means right? Yup, big muscled bossy bikers shadowing her every move.Dane, the president of the Savage Angels MC and the groom-to-be, is very protective of his fiancé. He doesn't even have to force his brothers to babysit Kat, they feel the same way. She has the MC members, the local citizens, and her fans wrapped around her little finger. They are falling all over themselves to make her wishes come true. They are probably just being over-cautious, but after her previous ordeal and the crazy behavior of some fans, the precaution seems necessary if only for Dane's peace of mind, right?Jonas, the Savage Angels VP, is also in charge of the club's garage. He just happens to be looking through the shop window when Carlos, the Sheriff, leans over and kisses Adelynn. His woman. But wait, she's not his anymore. He walked away without a word. What was he thinking? She's beautiful...she's perfect...she's gonna belong to someone else if he doesn't do something about it.Carlos has his heart set on Adelynn. He's been moving slow. Taking his time. Giving her time to heal. He knows that Jonas broke her heart. But he has a lot to offer and he's out to prove that she can depend on him to take care of her and her son, Ben.Adelynn's life is better now that her father is sober. She and her son live with him and together they run the local hotel. They are getting a lot of business lately because of the media attention revolving around the upcoming wedding. Everything should be perfect...but it's not. She should feel content with the success of the hotel and the attention of the sexy Sheriff, right? Can she let go of her feelings for Jonas and move on?As the big day approaches the plans are moving forward, everything is falling into place. The cake has been ordered and the venue has been reserved. What could go wrong? Isn't that when it always does? Of course, that's what makes an exciting suspenseful story. This we already know, cuz duh, this is the 3rd book in the series. I can almost hear the author's maniacal laugh in my head as the s*** starts to hit the fan. I knew it was coming, I expected something, I just didn't know what. But I did know it was gonna be twisted, cuz she's good like that. And it's not over. I'm happy to report that with so many characters involved there is plenty of behind the scenes drama that will be brought out later to keep us entertained as the series continues. But don't stress, there's not a big cliffy at the end, just some teases to keep us anticipating more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARRKXV1CEMOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S5MO5A#wasThisHelpful","R3ARRKXV1CEMOV","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to go on the road with the Vagabonds after experiencing their evolution into a band. I had my concerns about what to expect, especially with the band members being underage. They were at the mercy of Peter who promised their parents that he would provide tutoring and security for their daughters. Let's just say that from my first introduction to his character he reminded me of a slimy car salesman. There was nothing concrete, but he just rubbed me the wrong way with his offensive name-calling. However; he did have skills in the talent scout area as proven by the successful creation and marketing of the Vagabonds.The story picks right up where book one left off, and it is written in Kyle's POV. Being inside her head, knowing what was really happening, rather than what was shared with the parents had me biting my nails with worry. I kept waiting for their rockstar lifestyle, complete with the sex and drugs to explode in the media. I kept waiting for Bald Barbie, because surely Kyle was gonna end up slinging her off the stage by her hair. Well, at least that was my fantasy. Yes, I was just as frustrated with B--- Barbie as she was.Truthfully, what I was really waiting for was Kyle's birthday. Y'all know why, right? Cuz sexy rocker, C.J., refused to take their flirting to the next level until she was 18 yrs old. They shared a passion for music and for each other. I was anxiously anticipating their...um...collaboration. I knew they would make beautiful music together and that it would be extra spicy because they had waited so long for it to happen. Don't deny it. Isn't that what you were waiting for too?What I got was not what I was expecting. It was a dark journey full of everything that could go wrong in the music industry. It's definitely not a fluffy version of rockstar falls in love and lives happily ever after. Nope, it was, ""Harder, faster, longer, and louder"", until it wasn't. It was not a book version of the X-Factor where Simon threw 5 girls together and they became Fifth Harmony. Although, I did kinda have a giggle-snort moment imagining Simon taking Peter's place. Especially when thinking about how he would deal with Barbie when ""she was off in f---ing Barbie Land doing her usual self absorbed thing."" Unfortunately, Peter was in charge and he was living in Peter Land. He's looking out for himself and his wallet. He's definitely not the nurturing parental road manager type. He was there to make sure they showed up at the venues, the radio stations, the meet-and-greets. He made sure the merchandise got promoted and sold. He made sure that they had just barely enough of what they needed, and too much of what they didn't need.I think the title of the next book says it all, On The Rocks. All their dreams of rockstar stardom are hanging by a thread. Will their artistic differences prevent them from recording another album? Will their journey to the dark side keep them from seeing the light? Will some bad choices in their past prevent them from having a future? Will C.J. and Kyle ever be more than FWB? Will the author share Kyle's song lyrics with us?

"I knew going in that it was gonna be gritty and unapologetic. Cuz, duh, I read Kick, and it kicked my butt...in a good way. I had already met Tank & Ivy, and determined that digging deeper into what caused them to become the current messed up version of themselves was a journey I was looking forward to. What can I say, I'm messed up too and I like to read that stuff.Ivy is the club whore that cried all the time and had daddy issues, remember? Am I the only one that forgets some of the details in between books? I sometimes have to go back and read the end of a the previous book again to catch up before I start the next one. So, Ivy was in love with Kick. She spent a lot of time with him...before she was replaced by Indie. He was the only one who could handle her tears. Actually, he got off on them...he's sick that way. Unfortunately the club lifestyle gave her easy access to drugs, her cure for unwanted memories. Her recently broken heart, added to her mysterious tragic past, made for a hot mess that no amount of glue could put back together again.I knew she was running from something. I knew who she was running from. But I didn't know the details of the events that brought her to the Savage Saints MC. Was she there for drugs? Was she there for sex? Was she there for protection? If so, how were they supposed to protect her if she wouldn't tell anyone what she was afraid of? If she wouldn't share details or names then the club couldn't remove the threat, right? She had a moment of clarity when she said, ""Why do you think I've spent the better part of three years inside that clubhouse, Tank? I may be an addict, but I'm not an idiot.""Tank had more patience with Ivy than I did. Surprising, huh? He's a very highly respected member of the MC. He is well-known by his brothers and his enemies as someone who takes care of business. They call him 'Death', but never to his face. He's huge (all over), muscled, commanding, and determined. Determined to save Ivy, from herself, in spite of herself. I guess being broken himself he recognizes the same trait in her. They are like magnets being pulled towards each other against their wills. For every step forward, for every inch he struggles toward reaching her, something happens to undo the progress.The story is told from both POV's with alternating past/present scenes to bring the readers up to speed. Get ready to have your heart ripped out and your boundaries invaded. Get ready for your jaw to hit the floor while your eyebrows are being raised. Get ready to gasp for air because you've not realized that you were holding your breath, shocked and afraid to turn the next page...but unable to stop yourself. Get ready for the ride of your life that you won't be forgetting anytime soon. Yeah, I doubt I'll be having to re-read this book to refresh my memory. I'll be lucky to turn off the images flashing through my brain as I try to sleep tonight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJCAKCR22P55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517335310#wasThisHelpful","R2TJCAKCR22P55","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This biker lovin' blogger has found a new author to fangirl over. Burning Ember rocked my world for days. Yes, it's a full-length novel that made me unavailable to the rest of the world until I turned the last page and sighed with satisfaction. Having read truck loads of books in the last few years I have a huge basis for comparison, so you can take it to the bank when I tell you this book is amazing. If you like MC Romance, you will love Burning Ember. I can't wait for more of the HOC series. I fell in love with so many characters that I can't wait to spend more time with.</p>I had a girl crush on Ember from the beginning. She is a survivor, refusing to let life win. She's been through hell but she's still fighting and sacrificing. She hasn't lost her ability to love and put others before herself. She's learned her lessons well and is determined to make different choices in the future. One of those decisions is regarding the type of men she allows a place in her life. She had good intentions, until him. He reminds her of the devil, so she secretly tags him Luce in her mind when she first sees him. He's a nasty piece of work, spewing insults, trying to push her away. It might have worked if she had other choices. But since she's all out of options, she must suffer through, taking whatever is dished out, biding her time until it's safe to leave. Taking her punishment for looking like the woman who turned Mav into the disillusioned, hateful man that resulted from her betrayal. Every time he looked at Ember, he saw HER.</p>Maverick has been wallowing for five long years. He is bitter and he uses his words as weapons, cutting Ember at every turn. He's determined to push her away. He hasn't looked at a woman for years, simply using a clubpiece for relief as needed. They know not to touch him. But she doesn't know what's raging in his soul. He feels the spark between them, even though they both fight it. He sees all the men softening towards her and he's afraid that they will want to keep her around. He can't risk having her around though, she makes him feel, she makes him remember. He prefers to stay numb. But when he sees her laughing, or touching one of his brothers, it effects him. What is that feeling? Surely it's not jealousy, right?</p>Just when things start to smooth out, chaos finds them. It's hard to revel in it when all those things that you didn't even know you needed is threatened. When Ember's past comes chasing after her the choice is taken out of her hands. It's no longer her decision whether she wants to stay or go. The question is, does Mav want her to stay or go? Will he fight to keep her? Can he ever trust her, especially when he finds out who she is? He is a saint and a sinner, light and dark, which side of him will decide?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKQJGI0X4AND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HFFMBA#wasThisHelpful","RFKQJGI0X4AND","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a big fan of rockstar romance, that was was caught my attention and convinced me to read this book. I was also intrigued with the idea of a rocker being paired with a nerd. I must admit that being inside the head of Taylor was quite amusing at times. Especially when she was drooling over her instructor and thinking things like, ""I wasn't even in the damn pool yet I was wet."" I also found the book quite educational. I learned what ""sapiosexual"" was and yes, I even Googled ""See you next Tuesday."" I felt like I fool afterwards but had a good giggle at myself anyway.While the band, Goldenrod, is gradually getting more gigs, they are by no stretch considered rockstars yet. All the band members are still working other jobs to pay the bills. Taylor, who has been a 'runner' for most of her life finally felt safe enough to settle down. She has been practicing and playing with the band for about 6 months and is gradually starting to relax. Her chance meeting with 'Sexy Eyes Nerdy Glasses' opens a door for a job opportunity that might help her to stick around longer. She doesn't want to let her guys down, they really want the band to be a success.What I didn't expect when I started reading was the suspense. There were secrets, clues, danger and surprises thrown in to keep me turning the pages. Well, that's not the only reason I kept turning the pages, I kinda wanted to know if what they say about nerds in the bedroom was true.

"MC Romance lovers are gonna be in 'hog' heaven when they read Grit. It's dark and gritty, but also light and funny. Well, at the least the relationships are. The banter between the brothers of the Hunters MC is very entertaining. But it's the banter between Jaeger and Phoenix that will keep you giggle-snorting throughout.</p>Jaeger is the typical cocky, conceited, alpha, bossy biker who has no clue how to win over a woman. He's used to the women fighting over him, standing in line, always ready for any scrap of attention he is willing to give them. Of course the one woman who he wants to give attention to fights him at every turn. Her fiery personality certainly matches her fiery red hair. But don't make the mistake of calling her Red, that didn't work out too well for Jaeger. Actually, not many of his brilliant ideas went over too well. He's got to be the most clueless man to ever pursue a woman. He has no idea what it takes since he's always been on the receiving end. He's used to just giving orders and being obeyed by both the club members and the club whores. Being the Prez brings him respect and obedience from most, but not from her. He has a habit of describing in the filthiest way possible every thought that pops into his head and ever fantasy he's ever had about her. While it all makes perfect sense to him, and he thinks she should feel honored and take it as a compliment, it doesn't always turn out that way.</p>Since the book is written with both POV's I was privy to Nix's thoughts and feelings. So, I can vouch that while she was most definitely a ballbreaker, she was not totally unaffected by his bossy growly caveman shenanigans. While her mouth was telling him off, her body was melting from all of his sexy suggestions. And...um...so was mine. I really liked Phoenix and her sass was just what Jaeger needed. She brought out a side to the Prez that his brothers had never seen before. But she wasn't feeling the whole biker 'old lady' lifestyle idea. She's a country girl and she just wants to go home to her farm. She can't believe that her her father owed money to not one, but two MC's, and that they are claiming that her childhood home belongs to them.</p>That's when the action and suspense get going. There are more players than expected and it's hard to tell who is on their side. Brothers betray brothers and friends get caught in the crossfire. It's a nail biting, page turning, panty melting experience that you do not want to miss. I haven't seen any reference to this being a series, but I guarantee that if it is I'll be first in line, flexing my clicker, waiting for it to be released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUB05KZJPK40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2YX7H4#wasThisHelpful","R3BUB05KZJPK40","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was jealous of all my friends who were raving about the Gypsy Brothers, wishing I had time to read it but knowing that I had too many review commitments to take that much time for my own guilty pleasure. Well, guess what? I did it. I dived in and read all seven books in two days. I'm that kinda girl, all or nothing.And boy was I wrong about what I was getting into. I was fantasizing about 7 sexy biker brothers. I thought each book was gonna be focused on a different brother who would fall in love. Um...nope, this was NOT a typical MC Romance. And what a ride Lili St. Germain took me on. It was such a rush. I loved every second of it. I became a big fan and placed the author on auto-click status. Yup, if she writes it, I'll read it. I've joined the Gypsy Brothers Fan Club and will fight the crowds to scoop up anything released in that series. BTW, when I joined the fan club, it's the series not the brothers I'm fangirling over.

I'm not sure what name to call her, but I am in awe of her, no matter what she chooses to call herself. I'd love to stay and chat some more about this nail biting series, but I'm anxious to move on to the next book...see ya there.</P>SIX BROTHERS: The countdown continues...</P>This ain't no seven brides for seven brothers ladies. These brothers are bad news and their numbers are dwindling. Sammi is out for vengeance, rightly so, and she's not letting anything stand in her way. Not even her heart. </P>The more I get to know Dornan and his sons, the more worried I become. They are some sick puppies and she's playing with fire. I guess she felt like she had nothing to lose when she made her plans for revenge. But from this side of my kindle, I have to disagree. If she doesn't want Jase or Elliott, I'll take them...sigh. ❤️</P>FIVE MILES: There's an app for that... </p>It keeps getting better and better. Sammi is badass, remaining brave in spite of her fear. As the big event gets closer and closer, my nails get smaller and smaller. The suspense is excruciatingly delicious. The sparks are flying between her and Jase, and a few other places too. I'm hooked, ready for more, see ya there.</p>FOUR SCORE: Love will have to wait...</P>Secrets have been revealed. Hearts are broken. Lies are uncovered. Passion is present. Danger is calling. I'm afraid to turn the next page. I need to know, but what if it's bad and not good. Can I take it? Too late, I'm hooked, I'm going in...I'll see you on the other side.</P>THREE YEARS: There are things worse than death...so...much...worse </P>Consider this a courtesy warning, it's your mind bending alert. You should start practicing your what-the-hell look right now so you'll be ready when it happens Cuz it is gonna happen. It's too late to turn back now. If you've made it this far, you're already and addict. So make a fist and get ready for your reward. And then, move on with me to the next book in the series to get your next fix.</p>TWO ROADS: Poor little rich girl...The Gypsy Brothers series is a total mind-bending-experience, I love it! It really makes you think about things that you would never have come up with on your own. That's what makes good authors so worthy to be fangirled over, right? They have amazing things floating around in their mind and choose to share those thoughts and ideas with their readers. Thank you for the hours of entertainment and mental anxiety as I bite my nails and rail at the evil villains that were birthed in your mind. Thank you for the smiles and the tears. And thank you for the next book in the series, I'm not ready to let go of my addiction yet. I need to be weaned off gently. So keep them coming...</p>ONE LOVE: The price of vengeance...</P>I've been hearing about this series for a long time. I was jealous of all my friends who were raving about the Gypsy Brothers, wishing I had time to read it but knowing that I had too many review commitments to take that much time for my own guilty pleasure. Well, guess what? I did it. I dived in and read all seven books in two days. I'm that kinda girl, all or nothing.</P>And boy was I wrong about what I was getting into. I was fantasizing about 7 sexy biker brothers. I thought each book was gonna be focused on a different brother who would fall in love. Um...nope, this was NOT a typical MC Romance. And what a ride Lili St. Germain took me on. It was such a rush. I loved every second of it. I became a big fan and placed the author on auto-click status. Yup, if she writes it, I'll read it. I've joined the Gypsy Brothers Fan Club and will fight the crowds to scoop up anything released in that series. BTW, when I joined the fan club, it's the series not the brothers I'm fangirling over. There's only one brother that has my adoration, and yes, I would definitely hang his poster on my bedroom wall...sigh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC68KBJBRAJZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137QJXZQ#wasThisHelpful","RC68KBJBRAJZZ","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a fan of The Legal Brief series after falling in love with the incredible characters in Overruled. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Sustained, and Jake...sigh. He caught my attention with his unsmiling moodiness. I knew it would take a special woman to turn his frown upside down. And I must say that Chelsea is indeed very special.Being the womanizer that he was, Jake had his morning-after-scenario down to a system. It seemed to work for him just fine, until it didn't. After an eye-opening event caused him to reevaluate his lifestyle choices he attempted to make a change. Who knew that the change he needed could be found in the last place he ever expected to find himself?The surprising events leading up to his introduction to Chelsea and her clan were intriguing. I was drawn into the story a character at a time, unable to resist the broken and endearing siblings who pulled me into their unique situation. I wholeheartedly jumped in, encouraging Jake to let go of his fears and take a chance.One minute I was drooling over his strong, commanding presence and his ability to make things happen. And the next minute I was drooling over his strong muscles and his sexy tattoos. But before he closed the deal and convinced me that he was the total package, he messed up. Yup, I discovered he's not perfect. However; I still believed he was perfect for her, for them. Too bad he wasn't listening to me, or her, or them.He's the typical hard-headed lawyer who knows everything, especially what's best for everyone else. I was in full support of an intervention, regardless of what measures were needed. My heart was invested and I wouldn't settle for anything less than the outcome I had envisioned. I'm not sure what bargaining power I thought I had, but I bluffed my way through, threatening to throw my kindle against the wall if things didn't go my way. Am I the only one that does that? Fortunately the author knows what she's doing as she continues to prove by writing one successful novel after another. We keep coming back for more because she keeps working her magic, making us swoon, and laugh, and sigh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3452EDM6XSYVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501102079#wasThisHelpful","R3452EDM6XSYVT","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm basking in the glow of a satisfying read. I'd be having a cigarette...if I smoked. And for the record, Cole & Sin, they passed smokin' and went to full-on inferno. I almost got scorched from touching my kindle, it was H-O-T! I'm kinda sad, knowing that this is the last book in the Bad Boys of Retribution MC series. I'm hoping that these incredible characters will crossover into another series from time to time. I'm not ready to let them go. I can't say enough good things about Rie Warren, she's one of my favorite authors. She always gives me everything I need in a good book. She touches my emotions...yes, I did shed a few tears in this one. She touches my funny bone...those 'bad boys' crack me up with their banter. She seems to know exactly the kind of men that appeal to me because her bad-boy bikers push all my buttons, especially Cole. He's a bossy biker with a filthy mouth and huge heart. If you read a lot of MC books you will probably find this series to be on the lighter side. These are good bad-boys, they are not 1% outlaws. There are cops, strippers, and tattoo artists who work hard and play harder. They have a strong sense of brotherhood and try to do what is right, but if anyone messes with their women they will take any measures necessary to protect them. They seem to attract trouble regardless of their good intentions about staying on the right side of the law. I really enjoy the good mix of sexy and suspenseful. I'm looking forward to whatever the next project is, I'm a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFX03W6V67FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ADPC26#wasThisHelpful","R3IFX03W6V67FY","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel like reading a Ker Dukey book is a guilty pleasure. You know, like I'm kinda ashamed that I enjoy them so much. Like, maybe I'm disturbed, a little cray cray. Like, maybe nobody will ever know that about me unless I admit that I enjoy reading her books. But once they know...I'l be labeled...it'll be too late to deny it. Oh well, here goes. My name is Rosa, and I'm an addict. I know that when I read this stuff, it gets in my head and I can't quit thinking about it. It's like seeing a wreck on the freeway. You become a rubber-necker, staring at the mangled destruction, unable to look away. Once it's inside your head, it can't get out. So, am I trying to get it out? No, I've got an itchy clicker, waiting for the next book to be released so I can do it again.There is nothing I can tell you about this short novella other than it's about Ryan & Cereus. They have been together for 3 years. They travel from place to place and occasionally change their identities. You already know why if you've been reading this series. If not, well then you need to do that. I wish I could tell you that you will get all your answers to every question you ever had, but that's not the case. It's like a Hershey's Kiss. You don't get your fill. You still want more. But it's damn good...melts in your mouth...soothes your craving...temporarily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI8WRCBW15LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Z36GN8#wasThisHelpful","RVI8WRCBW15LG","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a short prequel to Two Princes (Sons of Sanctuary MC). It is the back story that lets the readers know how there came to be two princes who were unaware of each other's existence. I enjoyed the story and I'm greedy for more, it was just enough for me to whet my whistle. I have sooo many questions now. I also have a strong opinion about a certain someone who failed my badass biker chick aptitude test. I'm looking forward to more Sons of Sanctuary and will be moving directly into Two Princes now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5GWL4WH3Y2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014150CJI#wasThisHelpful","RW5GWL4WH3Y2K","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overruled is exactly what the doctor ordered to put a smile on my face. I literally laughed-out-loud at some of the witty banter and antics of the incredible characters that totally won me over. And I'm not just talking about Stanton and Jenny and Sofia. There were so many awesome friends and family members that I'm very excited to see again in future books in the series.The story is told in multiple POV's so the reader is privy to the thoughts, misconceptions, lust and love of whichever character's head we happen to be in at any given time. And dayum, it's H-O-T! You better have your fire extinguisher nearby, you might need to use it on your kindle. ""It's scorching flames, licking at our limbs, pulling us together from a space deep inside--making us clash like magnets separated too far for too long.""And then, when Stanton makes the trip back home, to Mississippi...it's a journey you do not want to miss. Yup, everyone needs to meet Nana and her shotgun...and if she can't settle the dispute, then there's always 'tractor racing'. It's never boring in the small town with only one hotel and one stop light. When things start to loosen up you can expect to witness some 'streakin' and some drunkin' logic, such as, ""my truck knows the way.""I'm most definitely a fan of the author and the series and I will be anxiously awaiting the next book in the series, Sustained. I've already had a little taste of the sexy man who will be burning up those pages and I can't wait!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23INGBOIS2YQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK394JI#wasThisHelpful","R23INGBOIS2YQC","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yup, it was that motorcycle on the cover that convinced me to read my first Jill Sorenson novel. I'm a biker romance junkie and the blurb intrigued me. It was a good decision and I enjoyed Riding Dirty and I'm looking forward to Ace's story in Shooting Dirty.This book is not a typical MC romance. I didn't even get to check out the clubhouse, if there is one. Shank's relationship with his club brothers is strained when he is released from prison. He's lost his officer standing and there are trust issues on both sides. So, rather than the usual brotherhood bonding and witty banter scenario I found myself suspicious of everyone and curious about the events that landed Shank in prison. Then, after meeting Mia, I was even more curious to learn about the players in her traumatic past.The book was a page turner, stringing me along as I waited to learn how Shank & Mia's relationship would unfold. Especially since they were both being watched so closely. How would they pull it off? And when they finally do more than lust for each other...it is H-O-T! But how could they ever hope for more than that when they are from such opposite worlds? He's an outlaw biker and she's a classy 'good girl'. They both have secrets that could get them killed if discovered. They both know they should run away, not toward each other. But, lets not forget who we're talking out, he didn't become an outlaw by following the rules, right? She's used to following the rules, but since he came into her life she's starting to feel again, and she doesn't want to go back to being numb. Can they find a way to overcome the many obstacles standing in the way of a possible future together? When the secrets are revealed, will they even want a future together?","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14K73BCFKFRSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z768TXM#wasThisHelpful","R14K73BCFKFRSD","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cocky Bastard was not what I was expecting. I was mentally prepared for an egotistical womanizer with a bad attitude and a smart mouth. However; what I got was a sweet, sexy, blue-eyed sports model with scruff, dimples, a wicked sense of humor and a smart mouth. And did I mention the Australian accent? Chance won me over immediately, his charm and wit were lethal. He had me giggle-snorting and sighing from the beginning and it didn't stop until the last page.What started out as a 'chance' meeting turned into a Thelma & Louise road trip. Well, kinda, except the passenger they picked up along the way was no Brad Pitt. I must admit, after spending days and miles with them, the sexual tension was so thick I felt it through my kindle. They were so obviously attracted to each other, but he wouldn't give in to it. Nope, we all suffered as we waited...wondering....when...if...and especially, why not?Of course I eventually found out, but I won't be making it that easy for you. You deserve to experience the unwinding mystery for yourself.

"Yes, I admit it, the title intrigued me and the synopsis sold me. Bradley's Whistle is a lighthearted sexy romance that will have you alternating between blushing and giggle-snorting from beginning to end. I read it as a standalone, but must admit that I'm intrigued about Decker's Wood too. Those titles are works of art, right? As I'm sure most readers will agree, while Bradley & Whiska are very entertaining, it's Casey that steals the show. He is hilarious and so sweet, I would love to be added to his inner circle. I would totally be on board for glitter, feathers, mocktails and Fancy Dress Friday.

"Bella Jewel is one of my favorite authors. It doesn't matter what she chooses to write about, I know it's gonna be good. She's on my auto-click list and I get very excited every time a new book is released. This time she tackled bounty hunting, and to make it even more interesting, it's a female doing the hunting. Grace is tough. She can hold her own up against her male co-workers, if only they would give her a chance to prove it. They find it very amusing to give her the small cases, especially the ones with the crazies. She is determined to show them she has what it takes, she just needs that one opportunity and she'll surely make a name for herself.Wouldn't you know that her big chance is just that, BIG. Raide is massive. ""He is six foot of solid, thick muscle."" He has dark hair, amber eyes, and a light accent. How is she supposed to handle all that? Even if she could stop drooling long enough to tackle him, he probably wouldn't budge a inch. And speaking of inches, he guarantees that he has them. He's cocky and confident in his abilities in the bedroom and is sure that every women wants him. Even though that is probably true, and she does, of course she would never admit that to him, right? Remember, she is tough and cocky too. When he pushes, she pushes back. And that's what gets his attention. He's never had to work for female attention before. I swear, when her asked HER, ""Care for me to show you how ungentlemanly I can be?"", it was ME nodding at my kindle. Even though she denied it, the chemistry between them was immediate and scorching.I enjoyed every page from beginning to end and finished in one sitting, sad that it had to end. It was also a learning experience, for instance, did you know that ""beer fixes everything?"" And did you know that taking your BFF on a stakeout is a bad idea? I fell in love with quite a few characters that I look forward to seeing again in future installments, especially Benny...sigh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XPHTSVSHF4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE4Y2BE#wasThisHelpful","R23XPHTSVSHF4J","A27FM7KYTCY1B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FM7KYTCY1B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was already a fan of the Wind Dragons MC series before I started reading Tracker's End, so I already knew that Tracker & Lana had experienced 'lust at first sight'. However; for whatever reason, they were not acting on it.Tracker is a muscled, tattooed fearless biker with sexy long blonde hair. He knows he's hot and has the women drooling over his man bun, and his...um...jewelry. And yes, Lana is among them. She wants him, but she's not willing to stand in line for his attention. It's hell for her to have to watch him with other women, but it's not something she can avoid. Since her best friend, Anna, is Arrow's old lady and lives at the clubhouse she can't see her without seeing him.Tracker saw Lana as a gorgeous, sweet, timid, wholesome girl that he felt was not suited to his club lifestyle. But that didn't stop him from fantasizing about her in those sexy Librarian glasses. When she agrees to help out Sin & Faye, the club President and his old lady by being their nanny for the summer, it begins. She's there, on his turf, every day.Is there enough water in the world to put out the fire that their chemistry sparks? How long will she be able to hold out once he turns his attention to her? How long will it take him to give in to his feelings once she stops running?And something for you to look forward to...her big secret...it's so delicious. OMG!!! I loved it and couldn't stop smiling and giggling as I enjoyed it and anticipated the big reveal.There is no such thing as too much Wind Dragons MC. I am so addicted to this ""family, not of blood but of choice."" They are all so full of personality they keep me grinning at their witty banter and outrageous antics. Especially kinky Rake, he's the worst. I'm so ready to learn the story behind him and his ex, Bailey.

"I have had many laptops and netbooks. I turned to netbooks because my previous laptops were too heavy to carry on my commute to work. My first netbooks were ok, I had all the Asus EEE models, 7"", 9"" and the 10"" 1000, 1005 etc. Some had keyboards that were too small and screens that could not play HD movies. My last netbook was actually a netbook tablet called the acer w 500. It was very good at playing HD movies and the keyboard worked great. The tablet function was tough to type a long email, so I found myself using the keyboard most of the time. I believe the tablet phase will fade. So I read the fantastic reviews on this model and noticed it was using an upgraded APU processor So I found a refurbished model for $159 dollars less and I must tell you this is the best net book available!!  First it flys! It is to me almost as fast as the I3 processors with better battery life. I notice a major difference between the AMD C50 (my old Acer w500) and the AMD C60.I played a HD video 1280x720 at 56fps with out a glitch. This is a video I could not play on any previous netbook I owned.(except the Acer w 500) The included camera came  as a .3 meg model but when I clicked on the Acer crystal eye webcam it told me there is a free update and after it ran, it is now a 1.3 meg model. It went from 640x480 to 1280x1024 with increment settings down to 320x240. Very cool! Here are my pros and cons:Pros:Very light (feels lighter than 3 lbs)Only 1"" thickComes with 4gb memoryThe dual core C60 w/ 1.3ghz boosted APU processor is a major+Battery Life is really nice (6+ hrs for me)Screen is bright with a 1366x768 resolutionPlays HD videos with out a glitch (Played a 1280x720 at 56fps)500GB hard drive (no space worries)1.3 camera with free Acer upgrade3 usb ports, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card slot.Cons:No bluetooth (will add small external)Keyboard has slight flex when you push down.With all items mentioned above. I am very happy with this machine!UPDATE: Installed the IOgear bluetooth USB adapter. Works great. A little tricky to install though. I found out the best way was to insert the adapter let windows 7 load its drivers then I ran the IO gear software and that installed the drivers and software over the windows 7 drivers and everything works mint! IOGear adapter is just $10 on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGV0IFDUAB4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065PFC34#wasThisHelpful","R2CGV0IFDUAB4U","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok my first purchase was a foscam from foscam's website. My second purchase was a Wansview model 541 (this model) to save a few bucks. The Wansview took a while for me to figure out because the IP of the camera comes fixed at factory set 192.168.0.178. Why I have no idea. This IP was out of the range of my router so I had to figure out how to connect to it. If you have a Linksys router it should work fine. The foscam camera came with a automatic IP that will adjust to your router. Typically with these IP cameras you plug in the ethernet wire camera to router and next plug in the power cord in that order (imporant) wait for the connection and enter the IP in your browser the camera is using in your router and you will connect. NOT WITH THIS CAMERA! If the factory IP I listed doesn't fit in your router range you must insert the disc that came with the camera, run the BS search, select the B model and hit scan then check the automatic IP box and it will update and you will be set. The camera reset and came up in my router as 10.0.x.xx and I could connect fine! I double checked the alarm motion detection and its the same as the Foscam. Now to the pros and cons:PROS:Picture almost as good as a foscam but colors are washed up a little.Listening audio works fine (only on IE or my android ip cam viewer app)camera movement works fine but no presets (bummer)camera alarm works nice, it sends me emails with pictures and sensitivity can easily be adjusted. After double checking its the same as my Foscam.CONS:Night Vision IR will not shutoff (foscam does)Listening audio doesn't work on Chrome or Firefox (foscam does)NO presets (ptz) You can't set where the camera will point except with manual movement. My foscam can be set with presets that will automatically scan to that location (very handy) This function on my foscam works great on my android phone using IP Cam viewer. I wanted the preset function and was disappointed that the Wansview doesn't have it even though wansview lists it as a PTZ camera on their web site. I use firefox alot and I was also disappointed that there is no listening audio on that browser. The foscam uses a VLC plugin for audio on the firefox browser. I do use the android app IP Cam viewer pro which works great. So to finish, if an extra $25 dollars won't break you, get a FOSCAM.UPDATE: As I use both cameras and compare their functions, I updated over time and use. I have since (today 2/1/2012) purchased the latest fosccam model F18910W. Will review after I receive it !","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGC7ORKGV1XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JLPWAK#wasThisHelpful","R1KGC7ORKGV1XR","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incredible camera. I have revised the setup to make it easier Here is the set up:To access from your PC when you are on your home network as a baby cam etc:1. Plug your camera into your router with the cable provided, plug it into the wall. The camera head will rotate. this is normal2. Run the IP Camera tool that is provided on the CD. It will find your camera and give an IP address. Enter this address into your browser. A login will popup. Enter Admin and you then click on live video and see your camera. You can now get into your camera and change settings or view and use as a baby cam or monitor from any home computerThats it! for a wired setup. Any changes you want to make can be made in the Device Management section after you login....Note: after you make a change, the camera will reset almost every time.NOW A WIRELESS SETUP!While connected to your camera in the Ethernet wired mode, click on the device management:1. click on wireless lan setup2. click scan and click on your wireless device that appears in the box (sometimes you have to scan multiple times)3. Most of the info will be automatically loaded. I just added my wifi sharekey code.4. Now Click the submit button, the camera will reset, you can now disconnect your cable. Wait a minute or two. If the wireless takes you will see the led in the back blinking very fast. If the led  is not blinking fast redo the setup again for the wireless. Wait a few minutes then Run IP camera tool and you should see the IP address of your camera. Enter it into your browser just like you did with the wired setup and you are all set! NOTE: if you constantly have problems connecting, reset your camera with a pin pushed into the reset button and hold for 20 seconds or so and repeat all the above starting with the wired mode. I had to do this on one camera only. Its rare but could happen.I found the camera to be fantastic, the IR mode in darkness is incredible, you have full control of the camera and the audio listening works great with IE and can work with firefox or Google Chrome after you load the free audio plugin VLC player. Good idea to click on device management and type your new password in user settings. I use firefox and while watching the live video, on the left you will see PT numbers. With these you can adjust your presets. Move the camera to point at a certain object, press the set to the left of the preset button and when ever you press  go to the right of the numbers, the camera will automatically move to that preset. Very Cool! In device management you can go to PTZ settings and set the PT speed to 1 for a faster speed.FYI, if you lose power the IP access code could change so I put my router on a UPS unit (a battery backup power supply). These are pretty cheap now a days. I also use it on my cable modem, so if I lose power I still have internet!Next how to set up port forwarding with a android app to access your camera on the phone.Go into your router. IF you do not know the access code google it. I needed to setup my daughters Verizon Router and I just googled it. Go to port forwarding in the router and enter the camera IP address and mac address and that's it. you can now put any of the iphone or android camera apps enter your camera Ip address and you can see your camera from anywhere. I use IP CAM PRO on my android smart phone. Good LuckI don't know why so many people have problems setting this up, when so many people in their reviews explain everything you need! The wired and the wireless have two different IP addresses and their MAC addresses are listed on the bottom of the camera! Plus you can google foscam, they have a easy do it yourself guide for windows and mac in their support page. ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU7LXEWJCDO68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046710G6#wasThisHelpful","RU7LXEWJCDO68","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read the reviews and purchased this heater from Amazon. The room I use it in has cathedral ceiling, it is approx 20x22ft with 4 large windows, a glass door and 1 very large window. It is our main TV den. Previously I was using a electric oil filled radiator type heater. The oil filled heater could not handle the room. As I type this, it is 34 degrees outside and I have this honeywell heater set for 73 degrees and when I first turned it on the room was 60 degrees despite my home thermostat being set at 68 degrees. That shows you why I need a heater and how all the windows do lower the temperature. Well it took about an hour, or a little less and the room is 74 degrees and the heater shutoff automatically as it should. This heater blows away the oil filled radiator. So far I am very pleased with this heater, it sits under the very large window, hardly noticeable at approx 9"" high and 42"" long. Very easy to set the thermostat which works perfectly, extremely quiet and this heater is keeping my main home gas heater from turning on as the heat from the main tv den now moves into the main living room where the thermostat is. This perfect for me since its just my wife and I and we spend most of our time in the large room. So now I'm anxious to see my electric bill. If its reasonable I will be a happy camper!  Will followup when I receive it!  Note the grill on this heater gets hot, so I would not recommend it for a young child's room.UPDATE: I received my electric bill from Nov 10th to Dec 10th 2011 for 1 month and my electric bill went up only $10 to $147 and I have not checked but I bet my gas bill on my central system is so much lower! So far I am a happy camper!UPDATE: 2-5-12My gas bill is 1/3 of what it was last year! The heat from this electric heater travels from our main den and keeps the living room thermostat from turning on as often. I live in NJ and this year has been a milder winter but we have had 1 snow day and many below freezing days and I notice a difference with this electric heater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TE38HVQR3ZPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BC2GGS#wasThisHelpful","R1TE38HVQR3ZPI","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This adapter will convert the RV female generator connector on your generator to a regular 120VAC outlet. I have the Champion 4000 watt generator and it only came with 1 regular outlet. The additional RV connector on the Champion generator is a 25amp connector and this adapter converts it beautifully and now I have two outlets to connect to my home appliances. I tested it and it works perfectly !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZFE70TQKT5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00268WS72#wasThisHelpful","R33ZFE70TQKT5Z","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you just purchased the Motorola Triumph or a similar phone this is a must have! Like one of the other reviewers said ""this is a great product for the price"". Everything worked. The case was just slightly snug , but a few minutes of stretch and pull and it fits perfectly, loose so it can easily come out. I like the magnetic cover on the pouch. I purchased this for the case only.  I already had the car adapter and AC charger but my wife needed it so this worked out perfectly. Nice products, very pleased!UPDATE:2-6-12After having these products now for awhile, I can tell you the case doesn't last. It is cheaply constructed. There are much better cases available all the other products that came with this bundle are working perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEYLJCAC14N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005E14HZY#wasThisHelpful","R1CEYLJCAC14N7","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First I've been an Amazon reviewer reader and writer for many years! I use Amazon because I know the reviews are from real people like myself and I can tell from these reviews if a product is a problem. Now as a Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept owner I wanted to upgrade and this large thin screen with a 1ghz processor seemed like a no brainer, so I read the reviews and what? There are many 5 star and many 1 star reviews....this confused me, but knowing that that is most always a 30 day money-back guarantee with the Virgin mobile phones I took my Amazon discounted Motorola Triumph page to my local Bestbuy electronics store and they matched the price! So if I may I would like to go into a quick past with my old Virgin mobile Samsung intercept for a second....I purchased the Samsung Intercept and had all sorts of problems, I upgraded the system operating system and with the correct apps made the Samsung a very stable smart phone but slow. I was pleased, but after a year and seeing that Virgin Mobile has a new DROID X phone called the Motorola Triumph I had to go for it. The Motorola phone size is thin, sturdy, beautiful screen and fast, in fact compared to the Samsung, super fast. The memory to run programs is about 1gb. This is just for programs!!! Everything works perfectly, Blue-tooth on my car, wifi, mp3 player,(I'm using power amp app which is fantastic)for videos I added the MX player app which is a must to play HD videos, speaking of HD videos/pictures the camera has a flash and takes perfect pictures and the camcorder can take 1280x 720 videos!  2x free app is a must for saving the battery draw. The 3G speed is about 3 times the Samsung Intercept, the screen is larger than an Iphone and super thin and the detail on the screen is just like my friends HTC fancy large android phone. I checked and my phone software ends in .39  Maybe if you check the one stars on this phone you will their software ends in .38  I don't know the difference and I don't care. I love this phone and I can tell you the reason people are complaining about the battery life is because this phone is so fast, so bright, so detailed and holds so many apps its hard to put it down and shut the screen off!!!!  In conclusion, I would like to point out that I did have a problem with the GPS starting time, so I did much reading and loaded the free GPS tester app on the phone (free on the market) and now I can run the tester if there is a problem and see the satellite signal etc and when I switch to the navigator GPS on the phone it shines!! This is the best Virgin Mobile Phone on the market! I'm one  still on the #25 dollar plan. BTW use superbox app, it does everything you need.PROS:Fast,runs every app I can throw at itVery bright screen and very detailedMemory for holding and running apps is 1gb (great)Memory for running the processor is 200mb or moreProcessor speed is 1gb  (fast)Pictures and Videos are fantastic taking and playing (set to high)Camera flash works wellCase is well designed with a rubber none slip feel and very thinCons:Battery life drains faster than I would like1. because the phone can not be put down!!!!2. Use the battery saver apps like 2x battery or others.IF you have a problem with the GPS starting,try running the free GPS tester app first.UPDATE:Everything above still stands. I also found the black Empire kit that Amazon sells with the pouch, car charger and AC charger to be a must. Also the phone comes with the side power button programmed to drop cellphone calls. You can unprogram this in settings. This is a must for me because I was cancelling my calls while taking the phone out of the pouch. I also downloaded the super keyboard app and it works better for emailing /texting on the screen. This phone is now my emailer, texter, mp3 player, camcorder, camera, flashlight, gaming device, newspaper reader, weather monitor, GPS (better than a garmin) my calculator, VM Minutes monitor, barcode reader,google voice search and much more anyone who gives this phone a one star is crazy, this is the best VM smartphone to date!UPDATE: April 2012 all above stands, except this phone does take a while to connect to the GPS signal and I now found that the fastest way to connect to GPS is to run the App GPS Status and toolbox. It is better than GPS tester and seems to help the phone connect to the GPS signal faster also I'm now using the GPS app Waze...wow Great GPS to Traveling...Try it!UPDATE: August 2012 all the above still stands. Love this phone. I noticed that Virgin mobile is now selling the HTC Evo 3d with 4G and a 1.2 ghz dual core processor. Then I looked at the PC mag reviews and the Amazon reviews and it appears that the HTC Evo 3g has problems receiving phone calls and texting. Too bad, I was ready to upgrade. PC Mag also says the Motorola Triumph is the best smartphone on virgin mobile to date. I agree!UPDATE: September 2012 Because I was frustrated that this phone took too long to connect to the gps satellites, I went to my local radio shack store and purchased the new Virgin Mobile HTC Evo 3D 4G phone. Radio Shack gives a 30 day money back guarantee, so how could I go wrong? It is noticeably faster than the Triumph but has a glich with texting. Glad I don't text much. My BW now has my Triumph and it works fine for her. See all the reviews on this unit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32H6K13IHNRI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DTSBEU#wasThisHelpful","R32H6K13IHNRI8","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this generator after reading all the reviews. Amazon was selling it at $325 but I found a better price at Cabelas so shop around. Usually Amazon has a great price. The generator arrived by UPS with no damage to the box. I had previously gone to the Championpowerequipmentl.com and downloaded the manual. I opened the box installed the wheel kit and handle (very easy to install and a must have item) I then installed the spark arrester (two screws installs in seconds) and added 10-30 oil using a 16oz cup and the cool funnel that comes with the generator. (generator takes about 20oz) I added gas (the built-in gas gauge is very cool) Set the choke to on, Pulled the cord and nothing, pulled the cord again and nothing. Stupid me the red switch on the side was down in the off position. (I thought that switch was for the electric only it is not) Pushed the switch up and 1 pull and the generator started. I don't have a L5-30 connector yet, so I used the 20 amp standard outlet that comes with the generator. I hooked up 1 1500 watt heater and a 2HP  air compressor and it ran both with out a problem. This unit will easily handle my refrigerator, gas furnace and some extras which I will wire into my house breakers for an emergency. I ran the generator for 4-1/2 hours and changed the oil. The manual says 5hrs. The oil was black. Added new Oil and now it is ready for any upcoming emergency. Yes it is as loud as a lawnmower, but not disturbing to me. This is my first generator and I am very pleased with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FF9TPC56WVIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00295MN2M#wasThisHelpful","R1FF9TPC56WVIR","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This USB device is perfect for my airpad as an external usb so I can easily move files from my computer to my airpad tablet. The Elago is white and matches the rim color, it sits flush on the pad rim and only sticks out a 1/4 of a inch. My micro sd card sits inside the USB tightly and cannot be seen. There is a little yellow micro tab that allows you to remove the card if needed. The unit also lights up with a little blue light to let you know when it is being used. Very Cool! It also comes with a well designed cord and a plastic cap that slips over the USB. The only con is the cap, if you install this on your keychain, I would not use the cap since it would probably fall off. I have read that the sd card can fall out, I find this hard to believe since the card is very light and fits tightly into the USB.

"After a couple of years my previous micro sd usb device had broken and I knew it was time to get another. I had it on my key chain and it worked great. This model looked exactly like my old one so I purchased it. Hooked on my key chain and as soon as I needed it to install a file into my computer at work, the cord fell off!! I ended up slipping the cord back on and holding it with crazy glue. The problem is the weak piece of metal where the cord hooks can easily bend. Hey it was a cheap device for a cheap price.

"First I am a true Amazon customer and have been for years. I always read the reviews on Amazon before I purchase. The reviews on this card were excellent so I jumped into a no name brand and got just want I deserved! I order this for my X10 tablet to replace my Sandisk 8gb micro SD card. I was so disappointed with the writing speed on this card 2.8 mb per second....are you kidding me? My old 8g Sandisk writes at 7.8mb per second. End of story. This is going back. Also when loading files from my windows computer I was getting errors and windows was telling me it wanted to scan and fix.???  No problem, its going back for a refund. This is the first refund to Amazon in a very very long time. I should point out the read speed on this card was excellent 8mb per second but the slow write speed and the errors are not going to cut it! I'm going back to Sandisk.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHXH60F7TM56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UOKK9Y#wasThisHelpful","RGHXH60F7TM56","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Too bad because I wanted a copy because Comcast was showing this on their free on demand movie channel and the 3D was amazing.

"Back in 2002 I purchased a top of the line Pioneer Plasma for $4.3k for my den and last year I purchase a 40inch LCD for the bedroom for 1.0k. Even thought its many years old, the Plasma holds its own, but I was due for a new den TV and when Amazon offered this deal to me, my wife told me to jump on it and I did. The screen is huge, the 2D picture is breathtaking with live HD. 3D is fun to watch and very enjoyable! I'm still learning all the features of this TV, I can say that I have not experienced any of the clouding/ backlighting issues that are mentioned in many reviews. I believe Toshiba took care of these with programing updates. So here are my Pros and Cons:Pros:2D HD picture is incredible actually breathtaking if its a live signal3D HD picture is thrilling and funConnected to our wireless network easilyRemote can handle all my devices (TV,Cable,BD Player, Stereo)Has builtin net tv,netflix,news,weather,facebook,widgets and more4 hdmi inputs ,2 usb, 1 sd card,RGB and audio inputsCONS:The Stand is tricky to assembleTry to watch 3D with a 2D signal looks terribleScreen has beautiful black mirror finish that could show a bright reflected light  not a problem for me but I could see it could be depending TV location)I can now really see the difference in programing. Can't wait for football season!! Amazon used a delivery company called pilot. They were great! They delivered the TV without any damage and even helped me assemble the stand. Netflix works super! I haven't tried all the other net channels. I read all the reviews on this TV and the mention about the blacks are cloudy, the 240hz must be off for the 3d to prevent jumpy screen. None of this has to be adjusted on my unit. I noticed when I put it on 3d the 240hz setting went off, the blacks are incredible! On the second day, the TV asked me if I would want to download the latest updates, which I did. I guess the only complaint and its a small complaint is while watching a 2D movie, if I press the 3D button and put the glasses on the screen is not watchable! Its distorted, but in watching a 3D movie from my player or cable company is great! Am I doing something wrong?UPDATE: Thanks to comments I wasn't doing anything wrong. This set will not convert 2D to 3D. No problem for me the other sets I have looked at that do convert 2D to 3D are not exciting anyway. Still love this TV, huge bright picture with deep black that I have not seen before and super colors. This sets blows away any other set I have owned and I've owned quite a few! 3D from my cable company is incredible! I had a problem with loosing my wireless connection to the tv and found if I shut off the enhanced N selection, it connects without a problem to my  N Linksys wireless router in G mode at 54mbps, and with this setting everything works, netflix, widgets and more!UPDATE:Like most new digital TV's this TV only has a digital audio output. If you have an old stereo like I do with only analog audio inputs, you will need a digital to analog converter. Amazon is selling the Fiio D3 digital to analog converter with cable for $24. You just connect the  cable to the tv then to the converter, run the analog audio cables from the converter to your stereo and you are all set! No noise! No delay! Now any hdmi input device will automatically connect to the stereo through the tv.

"The fan is beautiful, very well built super quiet. My wife had me take down a old fan in a bedroom and install this one. I am a master electrician and I have installed many fans. With this one the lamp wiring is very tight in the container and a connection came apart so I had to take apart the fan and reinstall the lamp. Other than that it works and looks great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34R2BRDTIRSEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JZVER4#wasThisHelpful","R34R2BRDTIRSEJ","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a stylus it works perfectly as do many other products. As a pen it also works fine, but I wish the pen cap would fit over the stylus when writing and it doesn't so you could lose the cap.

"Before purchasing the Virgin Mobile 2200 mifi, I was using the Virgin Mobile Ovation 760 Broadband2Go Wireless USB stick. It worked ok, but I experienced dropped connections and both fast and slow performances. I just received a new tablet and I wanted to get internet on my laptop and/or tablet on the train while commuting to work from New Jersey to New York. So I purchased the Virgin mobile 2200 mifi and immediately I noticed a major improvement. I have not received 1 dropped connection, my tablet and my laptop connect perfectly and automatically to the Virgin Mobile mifi after my first initial setup. The unit has one button, turn it on and wait a very moments and you can connect up to 5 computers/tablets/net-books to this product! If you purchase it from Wally, you will get a special 1gb upgrade. This was a pleasant surprise! I can't believe all the negative reviews on this product. All I can say is before you purchase this, check the SPRINT coverage maps to make sure you can get a connection. (Virgin uses sprint towers) I am very happy with this product, the battery lasts hours and charges easily through a USB or from an AC outlet with the supplied power supply.UPDATE:Got clobbered from Hurricane Irene. No power, no tv, no internet from Comcast. So I turned on my Virgin Mobile MiFi and the whole family was connected for days!!! This product is fantastic, much better than the old USB 3G stick. I am shocked by all the negative reviews!! Maybe these people expect super speed!? I'm impressed with the speed, easy to surf the web, check emails etc. Maybe its the area? I am on the Jersey shore and it works at work in New York just as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDK1FLOXGR4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044IOGG8#wasThisHelpful","R1TDK1FLOXGR4S","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I currently use a Acer W 500 windows machine as my portable computer. I wanted a smaller light android tablet to use around the house, on the train to listen to music, watch videos, check mail and surf the web. Read all the reviews on many 7 inch tablets and settled on this one. Wally is selling this at an incredible price, and I could not resist. I have a Android Phone (Samsung intercept)so I knew how to use this tablet from the start. Here are the pros and con:PROS:Touch screen works perfectly, better than many capacitive screensVery light weighs .8 lb also very thin .5 thickCame with a 8gb micro SD cardKindle for Android works great for reading EbooksWeb surfing is fast, the included browser works fine (no need to upgrade)Mail apps make it a breeze to check emailTablet comes with Docs to go (which is a great app)WiFi connects fast to my networkBluetooth music to my headphones works perfectlyPlenty of memory for the processor to function quickly (420mb)Built in FM radio  (I also use radio.com and pandora app for fm and am and music)Battery life is great (haven't run it past 40% despite using  it for hours)Operation is very fast, and there are many fantastic apps to download from the Android marketCons:Does not have 3G built inDoes not play all videos or flashNo HDMI output162mb app memory (wish it had more)No front facing camera only a rear camera (not really a con for me I use my Acer for skype)I'm liking this tablet more and more! This tablet allows me to connect without having to sign a contract with the big wireless cellphone companies. I ordered the Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200 which will convert the 3G signal to wifi which this tablet accepts easily. Will comment after I receive it. For my problem with some videos, I have downloaded many video players from the market and found the Mobo player to work the best.  All in all I am very happy with this unit, using it out by the pool, on the deck, in the house. Great unit!UPDATE: received  the Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200 and now I have 3G anywhere with this tablet!!!  No contract!!  Buy from Wally and you will get 1gb upgrade!! Additional points on this tablet. I have loaded quite a few great apps from the market, but I wish the app memory was larger than 160mb. The Processor memory is 420mb which really makes this tablet fly. You must download superbox so you can control your apps and cache. Superbox can also load all your apps on your SD card to give you room for more apps. The apps I recommend are, yahoo mail (if you use yahoo), kindle for android, us newspapers, power amp, mobo player, tunein radio, angry birds (if you like games), textplus if you want to send text messages, software data cable will allow you to send files wirelessly to any computer using your wifi.TIP: Screen is so sensitive when scrolling through many items, I turn my finger around and use my nail. Works great to avoid selection. Try it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR5XCZRUPSB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050Q4UVE#wasThisHelpful","RAR5XCZRUPSB6","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before you read my review, I'd like to point out that you may see Acer pictures on Amazon that make it look like different machines with different prices. They are not. There are two models available the W500 (this model) has Windows home premium and W500P, has windows professional. Now on to my review of the W500:Received my Acer Iconia 32gb windows 7 W500 Tablet/ netbook from Amazon yesterday and immediately I unwrapped and fired it up mounted in the keyboard. After starting, I removed Adobe reader 9.1, Acer games, Ebay world, Skype4.1, and reloaded Skype 5.3, added Firefox with the grab and drag add on for easy tablet use, added sumatra pdf (takes no space compared to adobe9.1,  removed live essentials and more. My previous computer was a Asus T91mt tablet/netbook, right away I noticed the following about this Acer, screen is much brighter and more detailed, audio is louder especially on earphones, installed my 32gb SD card from my old computer with all my files and I could easily transfer to various folders on the computer. I adjusted the stick mouse and found it easy to operate. (But I am a old IBM user so you may want to use a USB mouse while in the keyboard mount) I have read reviews that the screen is top heavy and could fall out of the keyboard. Not so. Although the screen is heavier than the keyboard, I found it sits attached to the keyboard very nicely, I even leaned the screen and keyboard way back and it still would not tip and in fact I'm typing this review on my lap now!!! (Leaning the screen forward toward you while in the keyboard it could come out since that's how you remove the screen) Haven't experimented with the tablet yet, but I can see it is well built! Very well built! As a test, I played a 1080 blu-ray movie (the Mask) from my SD Card on this unit and it played with out a glitch. This is a movie that would not play on any of my previous netbooks and I've owned 4 of them. I have read in other reviews that this computer handles everything thrown at it. I also read the match up of the INTEL dual core 550N against this AMD C-50 CPU/GPU and the AMD blew away the intel. It took AMD 5 years to develop this special processor, a blend of a Processor and a graphics chip on one die! Very Incredible. AMD calls it a APU. Goodbye CPU! I can do everything on this machine that I do on my desktop, connected to my home wireless N in seconds, connected to my wireless HP network printer in seconds.  More to come! So far very happy! This unit blows away my former Asus T91mt tablet/netbook! I am so glad that I didn't get sucked into the hype of all the latest tablets with honeycomb 3. I'll keep my android software on my phone where it belongs! I must mention there is a review by Sticky on the other listed Acer W500 on Amazon that was very passionate and convinced me to purchase this computer and he was right on with his review!UPDATE:It has only been a few days later. I can't stop playing with this unit!!  I skyped with my grand daughter 50 miles away and the incoming picture and  audio was perfect. I was told my audio was noisy (I later found the microphone setting in windows was boosted to 30+) I adjusted that. I can't think of one item I don't like about this computer. Its so quiet! Tablet is bright, very detailed and easy to surf the web etc. The tablet has a nice  border, which makes the unit easy to hold so you are not putting your fingers on the glass. Bought a Targus capacitive stylus. Perfect for drawing and writing and browsing on the tablet. This is a must have, especially if you use the Microsoft journal that comes with the netbook for writing or printing notes directly on he screen. (Plus it keeps the glass clean) Tablet is fantastic, it came from the factory with a clear very thin plastic screen cover. You can use the screen with the cover on or take it off. I peeled mine off, but I didn't notice a difference in response. Screen is very responsive. I haven't read all the gestures that can be performed, I know if you hold your finger or stylus on the screen it will act like a mouse right click. I like the windows button (which lights blue), which allows you to access the task bar and start menu with ease. My old Asus tablet had a problem accessing the task bar especially if you set it to hide position. Not with this unit! Still experimenting!UPDATE: (a week later)Love this machine. Purchased the Targus TSM148US mini bag. It is in my opinion the perfect bag for this machine, holds the keyboard and screen with plenty of room for your power supply and earphones , capacitive stylus and more etc. I also purchased the tablet holder by Arkon, it is a folding tablet stand and this solves the problem for people that complained that the screen doesn't fold while attached to the keyboard. Works like it was built for this tablet!  I am also using my android phone with PdaNet app to get internet on the train via blue-tooth. Very cool! I'm easily getting 6 hrs of battery life browsing the web, even more with the wifi off and reading my Ebooks using kindle, my skype sessions with my grand daughter are incredible! The video and audio are perfect! Also I like Internet explorer 9 as a touch browser. This Acer is better than any previous netbook I have owned. This  machine is a keeper. Brightest screen I have owned in a netbook, great screen detail, with windows 7 I can do everything I need in a computer! I could go on and on.UPDATE (1 month later)All the above still stands, this is to date the best netbook/pc I have ever owned. It is super quiet, bright screen and nice clean resolution. There is a new bios update at the Acer site. I ran it and upgraded my bios to 1.08 This is truly a very well built tablet and after a month of use, I'm enjoying it more and more. I just played a HD Movie file that was 1920 x 1080 with not even a glitch. My dual-core 2.5ghz desktop at work can't play this file with out glitches/pauses. This machine is incredible! One last point, I don't remember if I mentioned it in the past but this computer has been reported to accept SDXC cards. Why is this important? SDXC are the newest SD cards and they can go up to 2 terabytes!!  Of course at this time a 2 terabyte card would cost you 5k, but you can purchase a 64gb sdxc card for about $115 dollars and this means this computer unlike many other tablets will always have the room for your future programs!UPDATE (2 months later)Everything above still stands. In fact, my main laptop was a HP 14 inch dual core machine. I gave it to my brother, this Acer is my main laptop, Netbook, Tablet, what ever you wish to call it. Bright screen and very quiet. BTW, I stopped using pdanet and switched to the virgin mobile 2200 mifi to get internet on the train. It is a fantastic product. No contract, buy from wally and you will get a free 1gb upgrade of data per month.UPDATE (January 2013)For those that will question a use of a windows tablet. There is no doubt that if you want a tablet, a windows tablet has many more functions then a android tablet and windows 8 is perfect to install on this unit. For the year 2011 this was a nice tablet/laptop but now its 2013 and OMG there are so many choices out there with windows 8 already installed. There is the HP surface, the Lenovo ideapad, the Lenovo twist and much more. All these mentioned are now better than this machine. Technology gets better every year. So I too have moved on, Presently I am using the Acer Aspire one 722 netbook with the C60 processor but I am looking at one of these models mentioned above. For those who still have their Acer w 500 I bet you installed windows 8 on it to improve touch screen functionality! Right now its the only way to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2T3SFXJMHGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SBI2PW#wasThisHelpful","R2V2T3SFXJMHGY","A3GFQHHVMEAIO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GFQHHVMEAIO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"New from B2MP is a loving restoration for Golden Agers: a limited-edition Blu-Ray of THE PUPPETOON MOVIE (79 mins., 1987), Arnold Leibovit’s compilation of classic George Pal shorts framed by new footage of Gumby and friends learning about the work of the late fantasy film pioneer.Similar to Warner Bros.’ various animated films comprised of classic Looney Tunes cartoons, “The Puppetoon Movie” offers a number of Pal’s most memorable shorts in a breezy, fast-moving production fans and casual viewers will both enjoy. Its fine high-def mastering is reason enough for celebration – but B2MP’s marvelous 2-disc Special Edition goes above and beyond with a package that pays tribute to Pal’s legacy altogether.In addition to the film’s 1080p transfer, there are no less than seven Puppetoon shorts making their home video debut in spectacular HD (“And To Think I Saw It On Mulberry Street,” “500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,” “The Sky Princess,” “Rhapsody in Wood,” “Date With Duke,” Jasper and the Beanstalk,” and “Rhythm in the Ranks”), as well as an HD presentation of the Jimmy Durante-Terry Moore B&W feature “The Great Rupert,” and a handful of full-length Puppetoon shorts in standard def (“What Ho She Bumps,” “Mr. Strauss Takes a Walk,” “Olio for Jasper,” “Philips Cavalcade,” “Jasper’s Derby,” “Hoola Boola,” “Ether Symphony,” “Aladdin and the Magic Lamp,” “The Magic Atlas,” “Jasper and the Haunted House,” “The Philips Broadcast of 1938,” and “The Ship of the Ether”).Extended interviews with greats like Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury, Gene Roddenberry, Walt Disney, Wah Chang, Duke Goldstone and Russ Tamblyn are also present. If all of that – and a commentary from Leibovit and animation authority Jerry Beck – wasn’t enough, there’s also Leibovit’s wonderful 1985 documentary “The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal.” Presented in standard-def, this loving production offers clips from all of Pal’s classics with fond remembrances from their respective cast members. I first watched the program on a local PBS station in the late ‘80s and it immediately generated my interest in tracking down all of Pal’s productions back in the heyday of VHS and laserdisc.This 3000-copy limited edition is an essential purchase for Pal aficionados, lovers of classic animation and film fantasy alike. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99IQIWO7TTAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL9D6JG#wasThisHelpful","R99IQIWO7TTAU","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I don't classify it as the funniest film ever made, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD is undoubtedly one of the biggest cinematic comedies ever mounted in terms of scale - offering a veritable who's who of classic Golden Age comedians in a picture that has long generated a love/hate relationship among viewers. While the movie's artistic merits are debatable, there's no denying that Criterion has produced one of the most praiseworthy restorations we've seen on home video in years with their new Blu-Ray/DVD edition of Stanley Kramer's gargantuan 1963 release.The screenplay by William Rose and his wife, Tania (who had previously written the British car rally comedy ""Genevieve""), opens with a group of motorists watching in awe as Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) speeds off a highway overpass, crashing into a ravine where he reveals (prior to literally kicking the bucket) that a treasure is buried under a ""Big W"" in Palm Springs, California. With this hot tip, the motorists stage a frantic mad dash for the coast, splitting up into different groups and getting into every kind of predicament imaginable. Their progress is tracked by Captain T.G. Culpeper (Spencer Tracy), ready for retirement after spending years as an honest cop, wanting only to bring the situation to a close in order to round out his distinguished career.The crazies he's after include J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), his wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine), her mother (Ethel Merman) and, eventually, brother (a funny Dick Shawn); Melville Crump (Sid Caesar) and his wife (Edie Adams); botanist J. Algernon Hawthorne (Terry-Thomas); Ding Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett); and the irascible Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters). However, if that wasn't enough, Kramer filled his supporting roles a wealth of talented and formidable performers, many of whom had already achieved fame or would later to go onto find it - names like Jim Backus, Joe E. Brown, William Demarest, Andy Devine, Selma Diamond, Peter Falk, Norman Fell, Stan Freberg, Sterling Holloway, Don Knotts, and Carl Reiner, plus cameos from Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges for good measure.Having not lived through its era, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is a tough nut to crack. The movie means a good deal more to nostalgic viewers than anyone else, especially since its comedy is seldom more than gently amusing. The big laughs one would expect from the assembled cast seldom materialize throughout the course of its three hours, and yet as I've come to find out over the years, the movie grows on you. It's not hilarious, but it's likeable, and serves as a time capsule of its day - and where else in the history of cinema have so many legends come together for one motion picture? Even if the film is less than the sum of its parts, seeing these performers working together alone is worthwhile, and Kramer's use of the wide scope frame also makes his comic odyssey visually stimulating. It's not a classic, but it is a one-of-a-kind motion picture experience whose place in history is stamped by the talent who worked on it.While the film was heavily promoted as a Cinerama feature, Kramer actually shot the film in the 70mm Ultra Panavision process, and the movie originally opened in Roadshow release at 192 minutes in November of 1963. United Artists, however, quickly pared the film down to 163 minutes (later 154 mins. minus overture/intermission/exit music) -- some have claimed to accommodate more screenings in theaters -- and for many years the longer Roadshow version of the movie was thought to be lost forever. MGM/UA attempted to restore what they could salvage of the lost footage in the early `90s for a laserdisc release that ran 20 minutes longer, but was hampered by sequences that were inserted in the wrong order and also transferred at varying aspect ratios.Working with restoration authority Robert A. Harris, Criterion has produced a spectacular new, 197-minute presentation exclusively for their new Blu-Ray/DVD release. The care that went into this production is evident throughout, and it is truly remarkable what Criterion and Harris were able to find. This new restoration offers footage added back into the film for the first time, as well as newly remastered deleted scenes that are an enhancement from the prior attempt at restoring the full Roadshow version - scenes are here inserted back in their proper place, others that were ""warped"" for Cinerama exhibition have been corrected, sequences with Japanese subtitles that were zoomed-in and cropped have been fixed as best they can, and others lacking visuals have been carefully matched with stills from the movie (several audio drop-outs have also been rectified with subtitles). Given that none of the original film elements exist - and that the added scenes come from a myriad of sources that have been ravaged by time, sticking out visually from the rest of the picture - it's amazing how much of the ""lost footage"" has been resurrected here on Blu-Ray, and how well it plays together.Another notable aspect of the restoration was the decision to lift the color off the laserdisc master for some of the excised material - a necessity given that those sequences have faded even further over the 20 years since their previous exhibition, and offer virtually no color when viewed today. By using the same process that converts 2D movies to 3D, Harris and Criterion were able to add color to newly rescanned in HD - but now-monochrome - material. It's fascinating to see their cutting-edge efforts in action, even if the end result carries B&W borders along the image (since the laserdisc didn't transfer the full aspect ratio of the film, no color guide existed for that part of the image).The 1080p image itself otherwise is just brilliant -- working from the same gorgeous master MGM produced for their earlier Blu-Ray release, which offered pinpoint detail. This is what every catalog release ought to look like on Blu-Ray but seldom does, and if the 197-minute version offers too much ""Mad World"" for you (even the movie's Intermission ""police calls"" have been reinstated) ,the ""Shorter Roadshow"" 163-minute version is also included here on its own disc, with both pictures offering a robust 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack that does justice to Ernest Gold's raucous, infectious - and admittedly repetitive - score.Extras, as you'd anticipate, are in abundance, though fans may lament the loss of the older laserdisc documentary, which made its way onto MGM's prior DVD and Blu-Ray releases. A group commentary track with fans Mark Evanier, Mike Schlesinger, and Paul Scrabo offers as much trivia on the extended version as you'd ever want to hear; excerpts from a 1974 Kramer-hosted talk show include recollections from Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett and Jonathan Winters; a press interview from `63 and two episodes from the TV program ""Telescope"" offer priceless, vintage footage of the cast behind the scenes; a 10 minute extract from the 2000 AFI TV special ""100 Years...100 Laughs"" features comments from admirers like David Alan Grier and Whoopi Goldberg (who starred in the unfortunate semi-remake ""Rat Race""); Sten Freberg's original TV and radio ads with his introduction; trailers and radio spots; and footage from a 2012 event, ""The Last 70mm Film Festival,"" hosted by Billy Crystal and offering appearances from surviving cast and crew members. It's a shame the program ends at the 38 minute mark - one wishes the conversation had lasted longer, particularly considering half of the featurette is spent introducing the various participants.The package is housed in a cardboard foldout case with Jack Davis' original artwork and a three-disc DVD copy that offers a standard-def version of the same presentation. For fans, this is as much as one could hope for - ""Mad"" indeed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERZ1Z1R6Z2VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBT61YS#wasThisHelpful","R3ERZ1Z1R6Z2VM","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sir Lew Grade’s ITC Entertainment produced a number of high-profile cinematic vehicles in the ‘70s, several of them ending up as notable box-office failures. The most notorious of the lot was RAISE THE TITANIC, a film that’s actually not nearly as terrible as its disastrous commercial performance would lead one to believe.raisetitanicIn order to tap into the film’s mindset, one has to travel back to the late ‘70s and early ‘80s – before Robert Ballard discovered the wreck of the ill-fated White Star liner and James Cameron spearheaded numerous expeditions down to the bottom of the Atlantic during and after the production of his 1996 blockbuster.In fact, one of the more memorable moments during my family’s sailing sojourns around southern New England and the islands (Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket, Block Island) in the ‘80s was when my cousin – a marine enthusiast – picked up a radio transmission from Ballard’s crew, communicating that they had “found something.” While it wasn’t expressly spelled out, my cousin deduced that they had found the Titanic – something confirmed in newspaper and TV reports over the subsequent days, back in the pre-internet era when news traveled just a little bit slower than it does now. For a couple of days, at least, we were in on the scoop, and soon Titanic fever would again captivate the general public around the world.Clive Cussler’s book “Raise the Titanic” was published nearly a decade prior to Ballard’s discovery. At the time, a notion like discovering the wreck and raising it – even if it was still a flight of fancy in Cussler’s novel – wasn’t totally out of the realm of believability, since the author wasn’t aware that the vessel had broken into two parts on the way down to its watery tomb. One of several books starring Cussler’s hero, Dirk Pitt, the book was a fast read – entertaining and compelling, and an ideal project for a feature film.Regrettably, despite an ample budget, the ITC-produced “Raise the Titanic” was a huge bomb (Grade ultimately remarked it would’ve been more cost efficient to lower the Atlantic!). The movie certainly has its share of shortcomings – a lack of character development and human engagement, a ponderous mid-section – but it also, as Roger Ebert noted in his original review, “has some wonderful moments,” even if “they’re bogged down in two moronic subplots.”At least Richard Jordan was a fitting choice for Dirk Pitt, who’s tasked with raising the doomed ship after the U.S. government discovers that the Titanic was carrying a rare element named Byzantium – something that could, decades later, be used to develop a nuclear defense perimeter around the U.S. Pitt, along with old chum Admiral Sandecker (Jason Robards) and Dr. Seagram (David Selby), not only has to find the Titanic and raise it, but also head off an attempt by the Russians to access the Byzantium and claim the ship for themselves.Stanley Kramer was originally attached to “Raise the Titanic,” and brought in screenwriter Adam Kennedy to rewrite Eric Hughes’ original adaptation of Cussler’s novel. Though Kramer eventually dropped out, the remnants of his involvement can be found on the finished film, which was ultimately directed by Jerry Jameson.Despite its terrible reputation, it’s a movie that’s never awful – it is, at times, tedious, especially during its less-than-thrilling sequences of submersibles descending upon the Titanic and their assorted problems in bringing the ship back to the surface. There’s also a lack of development among the film’s protagonists – the movie moves along in workmanlike fashion without pausing for scenes that could’ve fleshed out the script’s otherwise vacant character motivations. Why is Pitt so constantly irritated with Dr. Seagram? And so what if Pitt’s former flame (a worthless role for the lovely Anne Archer) is currently involved with him? There’s no pay off to their sequences, and no point at all in Archer’s token female character even being involved in the picture to begin with. The movie is more interested in hardware than humanity, and that lack of engagement undoubtedly was the main reason why viewers found it dull and uninteresting.If one can overcome the film’s problems, however, then there are some rewards to be found in “Raise the Titanic” – namely, John Barry’s majestic, beautiful score (one of his best from the era), which carries the film and gives it an otherwise absent emotional undercurrent. The opening montage of archival photos from the White Star liner, set to Barry’s main theme, is wonderfully done, and a brief sequence where Pitt meets one of the surviving crewmen from the vessel (Alec Guinness) carries a poignant resonance that pays off in Pitt raising the flag of the White Star line once the Titanic resurfaces. More moments like those could’ve made “Raise the Titanic” truly special.The special effects in the movie are also excellent for their time, especially the model work (shot in Malta’s tank) and the concluding sequences of the Titanic sailing back into port in New York City, completing its maiden voyage at last. There’s also a haunting shot of the Titanic passing by the twin towers of the World Trade Center – sequences that still move the viewer even with their pre-CGI technical rendering.Restored to its full widescreen glory on Blu-Ray from Shout! Factory, “Raise the Titanic” is certainly a more watchable film in Technovision (2.35) and stereo than in its prior, muddy, pan-and-scan home video crop jobs, the likes of which U.S. viewers have had to live with since its theatrical debut. Though the print shows its age and is quite grainy at times, the restoration of the movie’s scope aspect ratio and its stereo sound enhances Barry’s magnificent music (though I did find the 2.0 DTS MA stereo track to be too “hot,” even with an increased dynamic range over the 5.1 DTS MA mix). A lengthy trailer and a newly produced 20-minute featurette, touching upon the movie’s visual effects (though curiously not the excised prologue of the boat’s sinking – footage of which was ultimately used in an episode of NBC’s short-lived sci-fi series “Voyagers!”), rounds out the release along with a standard DVD copy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGYF1LKWXD8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FM4S7FE#wasThisHelpful","R2UGYF1LKWXD8E","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Holdridge's beautiful love theme from SPLASH was superbly articulated by Rita Coolidge and it's a classic -- for me, one of the best love themes in any film made in the '80s.If you're looking for the film version, this IS it -- it's not a re-recording, it has the same vocal as the film. The sole difference, and it is very small, is a tiny bit of added guitar the start of the track. That's it. Otherwise, it's the exact same performance, same orchestral backing, same everything as the film version. It also doesn't suffer from tape distortion that was found on the soundtrack CD Holdridge produced himself of Splash.A gem!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVBROX3QXAUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O3UOFI#wasThisHelpful","R2IVBROX3QXAUH","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A box-office disappointment upon its original release, the lovely David Frost production of THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE has arrived on Blu-Ray from Inception Entertainment.An extravagant musical adaptation of the Cinderella story by director Bryan Forbes and song-meisters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, who wrote a handful of tuneful compositions, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" was one of the last big-budget musicals of its kind produced for the screen. Gemma Craven makes for an endearing Cinderella while Richard Chamberlain struts his stuff as the Prince (in a sympathetic performance Dougray Scott would draw upon to a degree in ""Ever After"" years later), and many wonderful British vets appear in secondary roles, from Kenneth More to Edith Evans, Michael Hordern, Margaret Lockwood, and others. The film is overlong but beautifully shot by Tony Imi, whose widescreen compositions give the mostly set-bound dramatics some theatrical impact. The Shermans' songs run the gamut from bouncy to unnecessary, but between the good-natured performances and stripped-down fantasy elements (again, an aspect ""Ever After"" emulated some time later), this is one of the more memorable adaptations of the Cinderella story placed on-screen, with ample charm and elegance to spare.Out of circulation for many years, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" made is way to DVD in the U.S. over a decade ago from Image Entertainment. That release contained the full-length British version of the movie (Universal trimmed some 15 minutes for its U.S. theatrical release) along with several special features. Inception's Blu-Ray marks the first release of the film on video domestically since that out-of-print release, and it's a beauty: the label's 1080p AVC encoded transfer is spectacular, marked by fine detail, natural grain and gorgeous colors. It's as impressive as any catalog release I've seen this year.A number of audio options are included, from a 5.1 DTS MA mix to a LPCM 2.0 stereo track that's more limited in its stereophonic range, and an ""alternative"" 5.1 DTS MA mix that's not quite as bass-heavy as the other DTS MA mix. All the extras from the Image release have also been retained: audio commentary by director Bryan Forbes (particularly interesting as he discusses the film's production and bizarre financing), a 30-minute, vintage promotional documentary hosted by Frost (who executive-produced the film), and a 17-minute on-camera interview with the Sherman Brothers rounds out a terrific package all around. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKZR3JTJRUDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENP2R1S#wasThisHelpful","R2CKZR3JTJRUDW","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Carpenter's seminal horror classic returns to haunt Blu-Ray once again, here in a newly remastered transfer supervised by cinematographer Dean Cundey expressly for this release.Anchor Bay previously brought the Jamie Lee Curtis-Donald Pleasance slasher - which introduced Michael Myers to audiences around the world - to Blu-Ray in 2007. While that release was well-received by most at the time (myself included), fans objected to some of the color timing alterations in the image - elements that have been corrected in this new 1080p AVC encode, which also boasts finer detail and contrasts, especially during darker scenes. The result is a cooler image than its Blu-Ray predecessor, but one that's likely to please ""Halloween"" fans even more with its pristine presentation. On the audio side, the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD track is effectively layered with a good balance of dialogue and effects, while the original theatrical mono is also included for purists.The Digibook release includes some fresh extras: in addition to a newly recorded commentary track with John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, the disc boasts an entertaining, hour-long featurette ""The Night She Came Home,"" following Curtis as she heads to a horror convention last year. Footage shot for NBC's TV version of the movie (filmed during the production of ""Halloween II"") is likewise included, while returning supplements include the 10-minute ""On Location: 25 Years Later"" featurette, the trailer and TV spots. The disc omits the older commentary (first recorded for Criterion's laserdisc) and the feature-length documentary on the film, but seeing as viewers have likely taken in these extras on countless other releases, their omission here doesn't detract from the package as a whole. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMHEIBEQCY6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOB3N56#wasThisHelpful","R3EMHEIBEQCY6L","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shout's first year of releasing horror titles through their Scream Factory brand has yielded numerous treasures for genre fans, giving even B-tier titles like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR TRILOGY their due on Blu-Ray.Never regarded as a classic, even of the cult variety, the original 1979 AMITYVILLE HORROR nevertheless became one of the biggest independent hits of all-time. Produced by Samuel Z. Arkoff's American-International Pictures, the pulpy adaptation of Jay Anson's supposedly-""true story"" of the infamous haunted house provides plenty of cheap thrills and a few unintentional yucks to go along with it.James Brolin and Margot Kidder essay George and Kathy Lutz, who move into the quiet Long Island community of Amityville. Unbeknownst to them, their new home was previously occupied by a family that was slain by their teenage son in a series of brutal shootings. Whether or not the teenager was driven mad by the house (or something in it), the Lutzes soon find themselves being barraged by a variety of haunted house cliches: slime flowing out of toilets, glowing eyes in the upstairs bedroom, invisible play pals of their young children telling them secrets, and George being taken over by some kind of entity from another dimension. Even a local priest (Rod Steiger) fails to clean the house of its inherent evil after giving it the old Father Merrin try.Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, ""The Amityville Horror"" is standard but competent late 70s horror. The performances are solid but the movie has that ""plastic"" kind of look so many films of its era do. It's like watching an ""Eight Is Enough"" episode crossed with ""The Exorcist."" More effective is Lalo Schifrin's score, which unfortunately was copied in so many other genre films (and used in even more trailers) that it's then-unique mix of child chorus and creepy orchestral arrangements also seems well-worn.Shout's ""Amityville Horror"" Blu-Ray doesn't merely reprise the already-available MGM/Fox Blu release, adding in extras from an older Special Edition DVD that the prior Blu-Ray lacked. ""For God's Sake, Get Out!"" is a superb look back at the success of the film, sporting interviews with Brolin and Kidder, who isn't ashamed to admit the movie was her ""pay day"" following ""Superman."" Radios spots and the original trailer are also on hand, though the most entertaining extra is a full-length commentary from parapsychologist Dr. Hans Holzer. The late Dr. Holzer may be known to some for his occasional appearances on Leonard Nimoy's old series ""In Search Of...,"" particularly in the Amityville episode where he was a lead investigator. Here, Holzer engages in a fascinating, if not completely off-the-wall, discussion of the actual Lutz haunting, noting where the filmmakers went wrong in making the movie and needlessly messing with the ""actual"" accounts of what happened in the house. It's the kind of talk one wishes you'd hear more often in a DVD commentary. Shout has also shot new extras for this box-set, though the only new supplement on ""The Amityville Horror"" is a 10-minute conversation with Lalo Schifrin, discussing his oft-imitated score.Visually, the 1080p AVC encoded transfer is probably as spiffy as the film is going to appear, and both 2.0 and 5.1 DTS MA mixes are included on the audio side.The set also includes the Blu-Ray debuts of the series' two theatrical sequels: the tasteless AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION and the entertaining, if not generic, AMITYVILLE 3-D. Dino DeLaurentiis produced both sequels, which Orion released to declining box-office receipts, leading the ""Amityville"" series to head to the small-screen and direct-to-tape productions thereafter.""Amityville II"" purports to be a prequel showing what happened to the family that moved in before the Lutzes. Tommy Lee Wallace's script, which claims to be based on Holzer's ""Murder in Amityville"" book, is an unholy rehash of ""The Exorcist"" and numerous other genre films of the period, exploiting the actual murders that occurred in the house and adding doses of sexuality (including incest!) under the direction of Damiano Diamiani.Shot in New Jersey (exteriors) and Mexico (interiors), ""Amityville II"" leaves one with a sour taste, mainly due to its attempt to explain the brutal killings by having the teen son responsible for the crimes being possessed by a demon. The movie has an eclectic cast, with James Olson as a priest who attempts to exorcise the teenager of all evils, Burt Young as the doomed father of the Montelli clan, Moses Gunn as an attorney and Diane Franklin (seen also in ""The Last American Virgin"" during the summer of `82) as the eldest Montelli daughter. The make-up effects are okay in an `80s gross-out kind of way, but the sequences showing the Montelli son running around, gunning down his family, leave an uncomfortable feeling that no amount of subsequent hocus-pocus can eradicate. (For the movie's defenders, ask yourself if most folks today would enjoy watching an exploitation film about the Newtown shootings with the gunman's actions being explained by him being possessed by a gooey-green monster)A film that's always carried a notorious reputation for that reason, ""Amityville II"" makes its Blu-Ray debut sporting the most amount of supplements in Shout's box-set: a 10-minute interview with the Italian director (who passed away earlier this year) is on-hand, as are recent conversations with Diane Franklin and co-stars Rutanya Alda and Andrew Prine, plus writer Tommy Lee Wallace, who was about to make his directorial debut on ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" when he took the assignment to pen the sequel/prequel. There's also a lengthy talk with Hans Holzer's daughter, Alexandra, who discusses her father's work and also participates in a limp commentary track filled with long silences. The trailer, a fresh 1080p AVC encoded transfer and 5.1 DTS MA stereo and mono audio round out the release.With Richard Fleischer at the helm, the following year's AMITYVILLE 3-D offers a superior viewing experience, seemingly more influenced by ""Poltergeist"" and similar supernatural tales than its predecessors (the movie was even released with a disclaimer that it was unrelated to either of the previous ""Amityville"" films). Tony Roberts and Tess Harper play the latest fun couple to move into the Amityville house, just to prove writer Roberts' theory that the hauntings are just a hoax. Unfortunately for them - and their daughter Lori Laughlin - the Baxters find out the hard way that the spectral scares are indeed real.William Wales' script and Howard Blake's score are both a cut-above the norm, and while nobody will mistake ""Amityville 3-D"" with a classic of its kind, the movie is a big upgrade on the second film and even offers one or two eerie moments (particularly after Laughlin drowns). The anamorphic frame also gives the movie the most cinematic look of the entire series, and presented here in its proper Arrivison 3-D dimensions, the movie at last restores its most entertaining element: its stereoscopic effects, which (while blurry around the edges - an inherent issue with the Arrivision-shot films of the era) are competently executed by Fleischer.Shout's 3D Blu-Ray of ""Amityville 3-D"" enables viewers with 2D sets to enjoy the film as well (the disc will default to either 3D or 2D depending on your set-up), though 3D is clearly the way to go if you have the ability to view its original format. The transfer is like looking at a Viewmaster reel in motion - a far cry from most of today's tepid 3D offerings. Extras include a brief trailer and a new interview with Candy Clark, who discusses her work in the film, which - like ""Amityville II"" - was shot mostly on Mexican soundstages.The set utilizes the original theatrical one-sheets for its individual Blu-Ray cases, though as of yet, Shout has no intention of releasing the discs individually.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XATULP24MCMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOZNF1O#wasThisHelpful","R2XATULP24MCMT","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It hasn't been a great year for 3D enthusiasts. Shortly after ESPN dropped their dedicated 3D channel, Real 3D stocks sank over the course of the summer as revenues for theatrical 3D releases declined to their lowest ebb since the current ""resurgence"" in the format. With Disney opting to can their planned 3D theatrical re-issue of ""The Little Mermaid"" earlier this year, it's admittedly been a rough go for 3D fans - though a pair of new 3D Blu-Ray releases from Warner Home Video should generate sufficient enthusiasm for format owners.The most exciting release for genre buffs is sure to be HOUSE OF WAX, Warner's then-groundbreaking attempt at marrying 3D and stereo (Warner-Phonic!) sound for its macabre remake of the 1933 ""Mystery of the Wax Museum."" In one of his trademark roles, Vincent Price stars as the kindly proprietor of a New York City wax museum whose business partner decides to enhance his financial standing by collecting the insurance money on Price's business. Not wanting to part company with his beautifully articulated wax recreations of Marie Antoinette and other historical figures, Price wages a futile fight that culminates in the museum being burned to the ground - with Price along with it...or so it seems. Months later, the now disfigured sculptor resurfaces along with a mute assistant (Charles Bronson!) with a new attraction filled with creations that seem too human to be true....Director Andre de Toth might have only had one eye but he still had a clear vision for staging a slick piece of 1950s horror moviemaking. ""House of Wax"" is great fun and catapulted Price into genre stardom - his Henry Jarrod certainly doesn't start out as a monster, only becoming one physically and internally once his creations are destroyed. Though long a favorite of horror fans, most viewers have likely never seen ""House of Wax"" in its original, native 3D format, which is essential to the picture's impact: every scene is lit and choreographed to make use of the then-cutting edge process, and although the film doesn't offer a lot of gimmicky effects (save the showman outside the theater with his paddleboard tricks!), the format adds immeasurably to the picture's overall entertainment value. Without it, much of de Toth's artistry is lost, making this debut presentation of ""House of Wax"" in 3D a golden release for Golden Age horror fans.Warner's 3D Blu-Ray doesn't disappoint in any capacity: the MVC encoded transfer is top-notch, with the print in sterling condition for the most part (the disc is also playable in 2D). The early ""Warnerphonic"" sound is encoded as a DTS MA 2.0 track, offering a mostly mono range for David Buttolph's score but with sound effects and ambiance that occasionally give it a wider audio pallet. Extras are tremendous: the new hour-long documentary ""House of Wax: Unlike Anything You've Seen Before!"" is a wonderful piece featuring interviews with admirers like Martin Scorsese, Joe Dante, Rick Baker and Wes Craven among others, all of whom extol the film's virtues, its 3D process and Price's performance. A newsreel, the trailer, a commentary with historians David Del Valle and Constantine Nasr, and even the 1933 ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (with Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray) is included on the supplemental side, with the latter presented in standard-def.

"Back on Blu-Ray in a new 40th Anniversay release, THE EXORCIST reprieves the same BD discs as the 2010 Digibook release of William Friedkin's blockbuster 1973 film, as well as adds a bonus disc with two new retrospective featurettes.I've seen the picture many times over the years on video, though theatrically only once -- in its 2000 ""Version You've Never Seen"" edition, which has since been re-christened the ""Extended Director's Cut."" Not knowing how a packed audience of mostly-college students would react to that somewhat controversial re-edit of the groundbreaking horror classic, I sat pretty much in stunned silence as kids used to gore but little genuine scares from today's genre flicks sat quietly, patiently and spellbound by a movie that remains as fresh and potent today as it did decades ago.This tale of demonic possession, shot in a documentary style by Friedkin and filled with tremendous performances (including Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, and Lee J.Cobb), is obviously best remembered for cute little Linda Blair becoming inhabited by a demon that enjoys spewing buckets of pea soup and spouting endless profanities, but the other elements of the film remain just as intriguing and mysterious for me: the opening sequence of Von Sydow in Iraq, the strange coincidences and unexplained appearance of the ""demon,"" and the religious themes which resonate throughout the movie and encourage repeat viewing.Fans have long debated the alterations made to the 2000 revision -- which adds a fantastic new stereo soundtrack and some 10 minutes of footage author/screenwriter/ producer Blatty never wanted excised to begin with- but for me, I found that it actually has more narrative shape and moves just a bit more coherently than Friedkin's original cut. True, the theatrical version of ""The Exorcist"" was (and still is) a classic, but some theological debate between priests Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller was cut against Blatty's wishes, as were scenes involving Linda Blair being examined by doctors that were referred to in the finished cut but never previously shown.These sequences were deftly restored to the picture, along with the infamous ""spider walk"" sequence -- a great new shock-scare moment further enhanced by additional ""subliminal image"" shots (one of which is neatly added to the film's climax). However, it's not just effects that make the scene's addition noteworthy: coming at the height of Burstyn's increasing paranoia, the spider-walk works perfectly as a progression of horror following the discovery of filmmaker Burke Jennings' death.The most satisfying addition for me, however, is the expanded finale with Cobb and priest William S. O' Malley that poignantly closes the film on a note that Friedkin's original ending was unable to do. The sound editing for the conclusion -- which intriguingly includes a note of the film's opening Iraq music -- is also effectively different in this version, reflecting the close of Blatty's original novel.Whether or not you're a fan of this version of the film, there certainly seemed to be more point to the mostly-narrative enhancements found in the expanded ""Exorcist"" than in the purely-cosmetic changes George Lucas made to his ""Star Wars"" films. In some ways, this ""Director's Cut"" is the movie Blatty all the while, and if nothing else, makes for an interesting contrast to the final cut Friedkin originally turned in.Warner's Blu-Ray edition of ""The Exorcist"" is simply sublime. The 40th Anniversary box contains the same two discs as the prior Digibook, and the still-exceptional VC-1 encoded 1080p transfer of the film - with both cuts on-hand - will not disappoint. The entire image has a clarity and crispness no prior video release of the picture offered, while retaining its original appearance (there's thankfully no `rethinking' of the color timing that plagued Friedkin's Blu-Ray of ""The French Connection""). The nicely textured DTS Master Audio soundtrack is likewise superb on both versions.Disc one of the double-disc BD set boasts the ""Director's Cut"" (2000 version) with Friedkin's commentary from that prior release, plus that version's trailers, along with three new featurettes highlighted by extensive, previously unseen FX footage and make-up tests. This half-hour segment will prove to be a revelation for fans, as it also sports interviews with Blatty, Friedkin, Linda Blair, Owen Roizman and others; a then/now comparison of the movie's locations; and a ten-minute profile of the different versions of the picture, wherein Friedkin says the 2000 version is now his favorite and the most ""complete"" of the different cuts.Disc two includes the original theatrical version, along with the extras from the 1998 DVD, from Friedkin's on-camera introduction to his original commentary; Blatty's original commentary with sound effects tests; interviews with the duo from that release; original trailers (albeit only presented in standard-definition); Mark Kermode's BBC documentary; and the ending that had been deleted from the theatrical cut.What's new to this release - in addition to a hardbound excerpt from William Friedkin's terrific new book ""The Friedkin Connection"" - is a bonus Blu-Ray offering two brief documentaries. Regrettably, the two new extras on the disc, while interesting, really aren't worth a repurchase for fans: the half-hour ""Beyond Comprehension"" finds Blatty returning to the Georgetown locales where the film was shot, reminiscing and relaying anecdotes that have been divulged elsewhere many times by this point. It's slickly handled, but nothing revelatory. Of more interest is ""Talk of the Devil,"" a 17-minute featurette that features footage of Father Eugene Gallagher, the Georgetown priest who was involved in the original, reportedly true exorcism that inspired Blatty to write his book. It's an interesting piece but feels a bit abbreviated.Along with an Ultraviolet copy, this package is likely to appeal to first-time buyers of ""The Exorcist"" on Blu-Ray, though fans who already own the (more attractively packaged) prior Digibook will likely find their current release to be just as satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQRT7POJPOX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYRNGQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3SQRT7POJPOX2","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about bizarre. Though billed as FRIGHT NIGHT 2, this direct-to-video film from 20th Century Fox is yet another remake of the original 1985 Tom Holland classic, just with the settings changed. Here, Charley, Amy and Evil Ed are in a high school program in Romania. Instead of Jerry Dandridge, we have Gerri Dandridge, a female professor with a taste for blood. Peter Vincent is here too, but instead of a horror movie host (a la Roddy McDowall) or a magician (a la David Tennant), he's a Ghost Hunters-like, would-be paranormal investigator. The movie plays out exactly as you'd expect -- same basic plot structure as the Holland original, but with more blood, less humor, and something of a road company cast that's not particularly engaging (though the female leads are attractive enough).It's beyond strange that the director and crew commentary say they're making a sequel to the 2011 Fright Night, when the movie is actually a remake. The story doesn't acknowledge the earlier film (how could it when Evil Ed is back, alive and well!) in any capacity. There's some vague plot element in Charley and Amy's relationship that ""something"" happened to them before, but it's never spelled out, and otherwise, the characters behave as if it's the first time something happened to them (Charley and Peter have never met, for example). So, so strange!Basically, though, the movie isn't terrible -- it's watchable, but nowhere in the league of the 1985 film or even the 2011 remake. Like a better-than-Syfy Channel rendition of the story, which for most fans, isn't going to be enough, though it's a passable timekiller if taken on its own terms.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYMDHKC7DX0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZH7QV6#wasThisHelpful","R3VYMDHKC7DX0O","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fascinating curiosity but something of a troubled and uneven picture, ""Greystoke"" was originally the brainchild of ""Chinatown"" writer Robert Towne. After languishing in pre-production hell for years, Warner Bros. finally decided to rework Towne's script - which he had originally wanted to direct himself -- as a vehicle for director Hugh Hudson, then a red hot commodity after the Oscar-winning ""Chariots of Fire.""The resulting film, which Towne removed his name from (in favor of the pseudonym ""P.H. Vazak"" - Towne's dog!), reportedly retained the structure of Towne's script in its first half - showing the upbringing of young Lord Greystoke (Christopher Lambert) in the wilds of Africa by a society of apes and his eventual discovery by a group of adventurers led by Ian Holm. However, Hudson deviated from both the script, as well as Edgar Rice Borroughs' source material, in its tedious second half, when Tarzan returns to the family manor in Scotland and meets dear old grandpa (Ralph Richardson). Suddenly the film shifts gears from a gorgeous, albeit serious adaptation of Tarzan in the wild to a drawing room drama a la Merchant-Ivory, compounded by leaden scenes (Richardson's Earl of Greystoke sliding down a flight of stairs on a dining service tray) and the decision to have Glenn Close dub the movie's Jane - Andie McDowell (a film debut she's spent her career living down). The latter eliminates any chance of Lambert and McDowell generating any chemistry together, so the love story comes across as limp while the dramatic development of Greystoke (he's never called Tarzan at any point in the film) and his failure to acclimate to civilization seems misplaced compared to the upbeat, exciting thrills of Borroughs' original stories.Further hampered by extensive post-production cutting (after poor test screenings, Warner Bros. reportedly slashed nearly 40 minutes from the film), ""Greystoke"" comes across as an entertaining missed opportunity that flirts with greatness but was sabotaged by poor filmmaking decisions - defined most clearly by the clashing sensibilities of Towne's script (which envisioned portraying Tarzan's story from the point of view of the apes) with Hudson's interest in depicting stuffy Anglo aristocracy. It's nevertheless a gorgeous looking letdown, thanks to John Alcott's stellar cinematography; between the movie's visuals and lush production, the film provides a feasts for the ears and eyes, even if it leaves you lamenting that Towne never had the chance to bring his original script to the screen (regrettably, the failure of ""Personal Best,"" and its spiraling budget, forced the writer to sell his ""Greystoke"" script to Warner Bros. in order to get that picture completed).After being delayed for several months, ""Greystoke"" - the fourth Blu-Ray release from the Warner Archives - is a winner. The 1080p AVC encoded presentation preserves Alcott's cinematography in a crisp, beautiful image that does justice to its most accomplished technical attribute. The 5.1 DTS MA track is likewise potent with a nice array of sound effects and one of John Scott's finest scores filling the sound stage. Extras include commentary from the director and associate producer Garth Thomas along with the original trailer.

Movies like the Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" surveyed the suburban malaise that enshrouded the culture arong the same time that President Bill Clinton went through his trials with Monica Lewinsky.One film that turned its attention to the past in order to draw a parallel to the present was Ang Lee's hypnotic THE ICE STORM (***, 1997, 113 mins., R; Criterion), which arrives on Blu-Ray this month courtesy of Criterion.A marvelously written and multi-layered film that's now as noteworthy for the presence of its young cast (Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes) as it is for its veteran stars (Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Jamey Sheridan), ""The Ice Storm"" was based on Rick Moody's novel about wealthy New Canaan, Connecticut socialites who opt -- with tragic consequences -- into clandestine relationships with one another, all the while neglecting their misguided children, who are fast getting into trouble of their own.Set against the beginnings of the Watergate scandal, ""The Ice Storm"" was shot in authentic New England locales and boasts a natural, haunting feel courtesy of director Lee and cinematographer Frederick Elmes. Composer Mychael Danna's unconventional score incorporates Native American instrumentation, accentuating the natural setting of the story's surroundings while enhancing its protagonists' disillusionment and the downside of the `70s sexual revolution. This is a movie that examines cultural and societal change and the negative consequences of its era's mores, yet does so in such a compelling filmmaking manner that it's impossible not to get lost in the picture's subtle and melancholy atmosphere. I've always found it to be a far more interesting and satisfying piece than Sam Mendes' more overtly in-your-face ""American Beauty,"" and rightly regarded on Criterion's jacket as one of the finest films of the 1990s.Criterion's Blu-Ray includes a 2K digital transfer (1080p) with 2.0 DTS MA audio. Extras, carried over from the label's prior two-disc DVD set, include Lee and screenwriter James Schamus' commentary, while interviews with Allen, Kline, Maguire, Ricci, Weaver and Wood are on-hand along with a video interview with author Moody. Visual essays on the film (featuring additional interviews with crew members), footage from a New York Museum of the Moving Image gathering with Lee and Schamus, and deleted scenes make for a marvelous release all around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTYGFDWUWOR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEIOHKA#wasThisHelpful","RRTYGFDWUWOR7","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gut wrenching, beautifully filmed and perfectly paced, THE CONJURING isn't just one of the best supernatural chillers of recent years - it truly deserves a place next to ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Innocents"" and ""Poltergeist"" as one of the more memorable cinematic excursions into the paranormal ever produced. That may sound like high praise, but walking out of director James Wan's stunning thriller, I was hard pressed to think of other horror movies that have captivated me from start to end as much as this one did.Chad and Carey Hayes' screenplay takes the true story of a Rhode Island family's haunting in the early `70s and embellishes it into a film that grips you from its earliest frames, while Wan - the director who single-handedly launched a decades worth of gory ""torture porn"" pictures with the original ""Saw"" - here demonstrates a far greater command of the screen with what many have already called a directorial tour de force. In fact, Wan utilizes a documentary-styled approach that's closer to William Friedkin's 1973 classic than any other supernatural film I can recall, and expertly works with John R. Leonetti's cinematography and a masterful sound design to create one of the more brilliantly directed pictures this genre has seen in years.The Perron family - led by parents Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston - move into their home in northern Rhode Island and quickly notice standbys of any film haunting: bumps in the night, unseen forces that cause their dog to bark, and an occasional chill that permeates the air. Their five young daughters, though, are quickly put into the crosshair of a supernatural entity that wants more than to just make its presence known, physically announcing itself by grabbing the girls and causing bruises to Taylor that she believes are just the result of an iron deficiency. Ultimately, the Perrons call in paranormal experts Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson), the earliest ""Ghost Hunters,"" who soon realize the family isn't suffering from a noisy oil burner on its last legs causing a ruckus.""The Conjuring"" carries an R rating but the film's violence is minimal and its profanity nearly non-existent. Wan eschews the gratuitousness of his past works in favor of a less is more approach that's just as scary for what you don't see as what you do (particularly when young Andrea Perron first encounters a ghost, standing in the corner of her room but only visible to her - not the audience). At first, it might be easy to resist the movie's familiar structure, but as the story unfolds, it's nearly impossible not to get wrapped up in the family's plight as the supernatural occurrences increase. The effectiveness is all due to Wan's direction and the uniformly believable performances of Taylor, Fermiga and Wilson, not to mention the unaffected young actresses playing the tormented Perron girls. Yet even with all the chilling moments, you come to care about these people, and the emotional catharsis that closes the picture is something few films in this genre have been able to duplicate (kudos to Joseph Bishara for a moody, effective score as well, with Mark Isham contributing a poignant ""family theme"" that plays a significant role in the film's concluding moments).""The Conjuring"" is at a disadvantage compared to other films in its genre because it's had to follow classic films like ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""Poltergeist."" For viewers resistant to horror films in general, there's probably little here they haven't seen before, and one could argue the more explicitly visceral elements of the haunting are its weakest asset. Nevertheless, Wan's movie grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits have rolled - and even then, you might be checking the rear view mirror, just to make sure nothing's followed you home. That's frightful filmmaking at its finest, and ""The Conjuring"" is unquestionably the most effective cinematic haunt of this generation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KLCNF4KBOH1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYMAG#wasThisHelpful","R1KLCNF4KBOH1S","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You always hear about people being nostalgic for the summers of their youth. When it comes to the cinema, it certainly seems that there is something valid about looking at recent movie seasons we've been having and comparing them to the same period from 15-20 years ago -- something confirmed when you look back on past seasons and realize that ""all those movies came out then?""The summer of 1985 may not have been as big as the summers of '82, '83, or '84, but it was still a hot one -- BACK TO THE FUTURE became a phenomenon, RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II was a bona-fide blockbuster, COCOON was a sleeper hit, and the ""brat pack"" scored another success with ST. ELMO'S FIRE. Mel Gibson came back in MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, Chris Sarandon proved to be a formidable vamp in FRIGHT NIGHT, Jeff Bridges was on trial in JAGGED EDGE, Val Kilmer lead the teen sci-fi revolution in REAL GENIUS, Joe Dante met with mixed results in EXPLORERS, plus you had THE GOONIES, FLETCH, John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST, and Roger Moore's swan song as 007, A VIEW TO A KILL, all circulating at once. A pair of western revivals didn't burn up the charts, but SILVERADO and PALE RIDER still carry along a pretty good rep these days. Even two costly flops from Disney (RETURN TO OZ, THE BLACK CAULDRON) managed to net a few admirers upon their original release.One particular movie was also released that June -- a picture that still lives in my mind as the ultimate definition of a ""summer movie."" I'm talking, of course, about Tobe Hooper's sci-fi extravaganza, LIFEFORCE, which has become something of a cult classic over the years and remains a guilty pleasure shared by many fans around the world. Now, finally, it's also the center of a long-overdue deluxe edition from Shout! Factory that gives this cult favorite the proper high-def treatment it has long deserved.No other movie in the annals of cinema can boast a naked space vampiress, London burning up in flames, countless outrageously bad performances from noted British thesps, and a great score by Henry Mancini to round it off. Throw in direction that treats the epic story as if it's a comedy, and you should have an indication why the film's popularity is higher now than it ever was back in 1985.But before we dive into discussing ""Lifeforce,"" one must first consider the unique background to this film.The Cannon Group (the makers of such classics like ""Enter the Ninja,"" ""Superman IV"" and ""King Solomon's Mines"" with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone) spent some $45 million on this adaptation of Colin Wilson's novel ""The Space Vampires"", hiring Dan O'Bannon (""Alien"") and Don Jakoby (""Blue Thunder"") to write the script, netting Tobe Hooper (hot off ""Poltergeist"") to direct and John Dykstra (""Star Wars"") to handle the special effects.""Lifeforce"" was, for all practical purposes, Cannon's attempt at a classy special effects picture, an out-of-this-world epic that would contend for the summer box-office crown of '85, and, likewise, make-or-break the studio in their shot at big-time Hollywood respectability.However, due to their not-so-firm track record at the box-office (and theaters owners' correct assumption that most Cannon films were strictly drive-in fare), producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus sought to find a distributor to release it nationwide. Tri-Star Pictures became interested in distributing ""Lifeforce"" with the condition that Cannon hand them the real prize - all distribution rights for ""Breakin' 2: Electric Bugaloo,"" the sequel to a breakdancing film that made over $20 million at the box-office six months earlier and cost, like most Cannon films, less than a million to produce. Cannon agreed, and ""Lifeforce"" went into nationwide release in mid-June of 1985, right up against ""Cocoon"" and Tri-Star's own ""Rambo II.""Well, we all know what happened to The Cannon Group, and their big attempt at box-office glory, but the fact remains that ""Lifeforce"" is still one of the most unique film experiences of the 1980s. It's lavishly produced but totally incompetent in the prime areas that determine the success of any film -- in a nutshell, ""Lifeforce"" is a masterpiece, except for the writing, directing and acting. Fortunately, though, ""Lifeforce"" is a prime example of a fun bad movie because the performances are so inept, the writing so ridiculous, and the direction so obvious that you just can't help but laugh. Putting it on the expensive scale that this film takes place on makes it even more enjoyable -- the more excessive the film gets, the funnier it becomes.Steve Railsback stars as Tom Carlsen, the American leader of an international space-shuttle mission to explore Halley's Comet, which is about to pass near the Earth for the first time in ages. The shuttle radar picks up an immense object situated in the comet, one that turns out to be an alien ship containing the remains of strange bat-like creatures (gross) and three completely naked humans, including French actress Mathilda May (far from gross).For reasons explained later in the film, Railsback's crew begins to die one-by-one, all of them having been drained of their ""life force"" by these interstellar vamps. Railsback, despite being drawn to Mathilda's bod (and who in their right mind wouldn't be?), tries to blow up the ship and prevent the creatures from reaching Earth......BUT their glass cases protect them from the fire (a surprise plot twist), and the three bad-vamps are brought back to Earth thanks to a rescue mission by the shuttle Columbia. They're put under surveillance in a London Research Laboratory, where head scientist Frank Finlay assures the audience that ""there's no way a naked girl is going to get out of this complex."" However, we know better, and Mathilda uses her vast powers to overcome the security guards (one of whom tries to stop her by offering up a bite of his biscuit), and walks off to inflict havoc on an unsuspecting London populace.Meanwhile, intelligence expert Peter Firth teams with our intergalactic doofus Railsback to try to track Mathilda down (she apparently started some sort of fling with Steve while on the shuttle -- God only knows why she picked him), which leads the two to an encounter with a possessed, pre-""Star Trek"" Patrick Stewart (who disintegrates into a blob of blood in a military helicopter during one of the film's funniest scenes) and a climax which seems to have been taken right out of an Irwin Allen movie.London is in flames as the population turns into zombies! Buildings blow up right and left! Big special effects fill the screen! Mathilda still walks around naked! The dialogue is even dumber than before! (As Firth and Railsback walk in sweating to a last-minute meeting with the Prime Minister -- trying to come up with a last-ditch attempt at saving the world -- his secretary calmly asks if they ""would like a cup of tea?"").If you haven't seen ""Lifeforce"", I think I've made it clear by now why this film holds so much entertainment value for those of us who treasure this sort of thing. Co-writer Don Jakoby later blasted Tobe Hooper, claiming he mis-directed the entire film and that he edited sequences as if they were comedic -- a charge that nearly every frame of the movie could be used as evidence to support. It's a '50s ""B"" sci-fi movie blown up to epic proportions, and as Jakoby stated, it's played so totally straight it threatens to veer into self-parody throughout.In fact, not only does the film boast excellent special FX, but it also contains atmospheric photography from Alan Hume (a vet of many fine British films, including several James Bond pictures), expensive sets by John Graysmark, and a gorgeously bombastic, melodic music score by Henry Mancini that's rightfully regarded as one of the finest of the 1980s.While it is, admittedly, sort of sad to see such talent being wasted on a film like this, you can't help but enjoy it all while watching it, and enough of the craftsmanship and artistry of the filmmakers shines through to make it an undeniably one-of-a-kind movie experience.When ""Lifeforce"" was released theatrically back in '85, it was first shown domestically in a 102-minute version prepared by Tri-Star, with re-cut opening credits and various, re-scored music cues written by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie (who shared on-screen credit with Mancini). The new, heavily-synthesized cues were composed to cover over various edits in the shorter U.S. release print, but they're vastly inferior to the Mancini compositions and stick out by comparison.Subsequently, fans of ""Lifeforce"" were thrilled when MGM/UA, back in 1995, decided to release a 116-minute ""Extended International Version"" on laserdisc -- an expanded edition that was comprised of Hooper's original cut for Cannon. This edition appropriately opens with Mancini's thunderous """"Lifeforce"" Theme,"" adds introductory narration by John Larroquette (who performed a similar function on Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), and restores Mancini's original cues to their intended form (Kamen's involvement is eliminated from this print).It also, happily, adds even more hilarious dialogue: my favorite is Peter Firth's exchange with one of the head male vampires at the end. When the vile villain brags that ""it'll be a lot less terrifying if you'd just come to me,"" Firth gathers his magical sword, grins and boasts, ""I'LL DO JUST THAT!"" (This longer version, however, is regrettably missing a priceless bit featuring a vampified- jogger combing through a garbage can, which remains exclusive to the U.S. theatrical release).Shout Factory's Blu-Ray offers both cuts of ""Lifeforce"" in a miraculous 1080p presentation that shows off the film's elaborate visual effects and production design. The movie's never looked this good on video (or even close to it, considering MGM's ancient DVD wasn't even enhanced for 16:9 TVs), nor has it sounded as potent in its DTS MA soundtrack. While the 116-minute cut is an AVC encode with lossless audio, the U.S. theatrical version has been included as an extra feature, presented in an MPEG-2 transfer and with a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack - however, don't be fooled into thinking this is a vastly inferior presentation simply from the specs, because this transfer is nearly as good as the restored extended release.Looking for extras? We've got `em - finally. Commentary from Tobe Hooper and Tim Sullivan examines the film's production; another commentary with make-up great Nick Maley is moderated by Michael Felsher; all-new interviews with Hooper, Mathilda May and Steve Railsback receive their own (if abbreviated) interview featurettes; trailers, TV spots and still galleries are also on-hand; and the vintage 20-minute 1985 Making Of featurette rounds out the double-disc set.You can't say that ""Lifeforce"" is a great movie, but it's impossible not to get caught up in the fun of it. I've shown the movie to a bunch of friends over the years, and all of them got a major kick out of it -- it's simply too unusual, too incredible not to.With the biggest effects to be seen this side of ""Star Wars,"" some of the most unintentionally funny dialogue of the '80s, and the worst acting by competent actors you may ever see (although Mathilda scores a 10 for her ""performance""), ""Lifeforce"" throws in everything but the kitchen sink in an effort to make the picture enormously entertaining.And entertaining it is -- right down to the last shots of Firth watching as the ship of extraterrestrial vamps flies away from Earth at the very last minute. We're all saved, and a veritable B-movie classic comes to a fitting, perfect end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156RR6R5G6B81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWWX6XY#wasThisHelpful","R156RR6R5G6B81","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Soon after George Miller's ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" burst onto the cinematic landscape in the early `80s, they ushered in a whole new genre of thrillers where warring gangs ruled the roads, fighting for gasoline and whatever scraps of food were left behind by scavengers. Many of those imitators have been (deservedly) forgotten as the years have passed, yet the MAD MAX TRILOGY itself remains a favorite of fans, with Miller's brilliantly edited set-pieces keeping viewers enthralled despite the familiar settings of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Warner Home Video's newly-released Blu-Ray box-set of the ""Mad Max Trilogy"" offers - in a single, three-disc Blu-Ray case (housed inside a slightly unattractive oversized tin) - a reprise of MGM's original ""Mad Max"" BD; a new AVC encode of ""The Road Warrior,"" premiering here with a DTS MA soundtrack; and the HD debut of the third film in the series, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.""The original MAD MAX finds Mel Gibson launching his career as a tough cop in a world where unhinged loonies - including Hugh Keays-Byrne as the nefarious ""Toecutter"" - attack unsuspecting motorists and innocent civilians. Max's battles with his own bosses - desperately hoping to keep ""heroes"" on the road - are contrasted with the violent attacks of the gangs, and once Max's partner is killed and his wife and child targeted by the thugs, Max turns from desperation to anger in a soon-to-be-post-apocalyptic society quickly spiraling out of control.Though ""Mad Max""'s world is only semi-futuristic compared to the films that followed, it's still a bleak, and captivating, environment that Miller captured on-screen - particularly considering the era in which the movie was originally released. The various car chases and action sequences deliver the goods, and while the picture - penned by Miller and producer Byron Kennedy from James McCausland's original story - isn't as compelling or tightly packaged as the film's immediate sequel, the original ""Mad Max"" remains one of the most important productions to originate Down Under. The picture ignited Gibson and Miller's respective careers, single-handedly ushered in a whole genre of similarly-themed cash-ins, and along with the works of Peter Weir, announced the Aussie film industry as a major player in world cinema.It's also a movie that's perpetually had to shake off a nagging reputation that it's inferior to its sequel - something not helped by the fact that many of us originally saw the film second, after ""The Road Warrior"" was released, and usually in lousy TV prints at that. With its widescreen Todd-AO dimensions cropped, and its original Aussie dialogue dubbed by Samuel Arkoff's American-International, it's no wonder ""Mad Max"" came off for many years as the weaker sibling compared to ""The Road Warrior."" Still, taken on its own terms as an appetizer before the main course, and with its technical trappings restored, it's an involving, memorable picture with striking directorial choices.MGM's Blu-Ray here boasts the same exact presentation as its prior BD release. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers an appreciable enhancement over its decade-old Special Edition DVD, limited only by the occasional griminess of its source materials, while most of the potent extras from that release have been carried over, including a 25-minute retrospective documentary and an insightful audio commentary featuring cinematographer David Eggby, Jon Dowding, Tim Ridge and Chris Murray. These extras, along with the U.S. trailers, are on-hand, plus a remixed DTS MA soundtrack of the original Aussie dialogue and Brian May's occasionally bombastic score (the American-International U.S. dubbed track is also included in its original mono).One of the best looking Blu-Ray catalog releases, ""Max""'s sequel, THE ROAD WARRIOR, has now been surpassed by a remastered Warner Blu-Ray that's even better than its predecessor, though more so for an augmented audio track than its slightly enhanced visuals.Gibson returns here as a more haunted, grizzled Max, with the world now completed dominated by punks while bands of humanity attempt to survive in the wasteland. Miller, Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant's script works in elements of classic westerns like ""Shane"" as Max reluctantly bands together with the survivors - including Bruce Spence's Gyro Captain - to ward off the villains.""The Road Warrior"" has always been one of my favorite films of the early `80s - an improvement on the original ""Mad Max"" in every way (from Miller's direction to Gibson's performance and Brian May's more sophisticated, richer score) and a driving, thrilling piece of sci-fi action that's never been duplicated in its genre. Its straightforward story, lack of extraneous dialogue and subplots, emphasis on the pursuit and energy of its chase sequences, and the brilliant editing and choreography of those set-pieces makes it an all-time classic - a movie that stands alone from its bookending pictures as a spectacular piece of filmmaking.Working from the original negative, ""The Road Warrior"" looked great on the prior Blu-Ray and has been improved by superior AVC encoding here, though in general, the two transfers look roughly the same. As with before, Dean Semler's rugged, atmospheric cinematography is enhanced by high-def, with eye-popping colors and detailed textures on-hand at every turn; it's a dazzling transfer of a film that demands to be seen this way, or not at all. The audio here also receives an upgrade with a lossless DTS MA mix (the prior Blu-Ray's audio was rendered as a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track) that rumbles with bass and a superb soundstage for May's musical output.The disc otherwise is identical to the original Blu-Ray, with a pair of exclusive-to-HD extras included: a commentary track with George Miller and Dean Semler, along with a brief introduction from Leonard Maltin that puts the movie into the context of its other series films, plus the original trailer.The worldwide success of ""The Road Warrior"" - and in particular its breakthrough performance at the U.S. box-office in 1982 - lead to another sequel, this time augmented by a larger budget afforded by its predecessor's commercial success.Deciding to go in something of a different direction, George Miller opted to turn MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME into something of a more ""emotional"" piece less driven by violence and high-octane set-pieces. Miller and writer Terry Hayes took a cue from Max's arc in ""The Road Warrior"" and turned him into a slightly more charismatic, ""Man With No Name"" sort here, with Max stumbling into a post-apocalyptic village named ""Bartertown."" There, a political struggle ensues between leader Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and the diminutive ""Master"" (Angelo Rossitto), who's the only one (apparently) who understands how to produce methane to power the town. Aunty strikes a deal with Max to knock off Master's physical bodyguard ""Blaster,"" but circumstances eventually send Max off into the wasteland again, where he finds a ""Lord of the Flies"" type community of youngsters waiting for the messianic ""Captain Walker"" to return.Miller co-directed ""Thunderdome"" with associate George Ogilvie, something that might explain the uneven pacing of this more ambitious, though decidedly least successful, of the ""Mad Max"" series. There are a pair of dynamite set-pieces on-hand when Max takes to the Thunderdome to battle the hulking Blaster, and Miller caps the film with one last, stirring chase with Max and the young refugees trying to escape from Aunty's gang on a train. As potent as these moments are, however, they're surrounded by a meandering mid-section where Max finds the castoff children, who look as if they've come out of the William Golding novel by way of the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi."" Their society isn't nearly as developed as it should've been, and for a group of naive youngsters who presumably haven't encountered anything of the punk-driven outside world, why one of them actually drops an f-bomb when they re-enter Bartertown is patently nonsensical.There's also an obvious lack of energy in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" at times. The thrilling, fast-paced intensity of the earlier films is replaced here with a more deliberately paced fantasy approach, and for fans of ""The Road Warrior,"" this PG-13 rated, decidedly less violent picture can be (and has often been written off as) a shock to the system. Even the production design of Bartertown seems uninspired, employing a ""Temple of Doom""-like aesthetic that makes you think Mola Ram is going to pop out at any second.Still, there are assorted pleasures to be found: Gibson exudes more of his natural charisma here, and this decidedly ""looser"" Max feels like a natural progression of the hardened warrior who rediscovered his humanity at the end of ""The Road Warrior."" Dean Semler's wide scope cinematography is once again stylish, and Turner brings sufficient life to her scenes as a scavenger who's recreated herself as the leader of Bartertown (""he's just a raggedy man!""). What's more, Maurice Jarre's glorious orchestral score helps to smooth over some of the picture's rough passages - with its sweeping scale and melodic interludes, ""Thunderdome"" is one of Jarre's strongest efforts from one of his most prolific periods (his marvelous ""Enemy Mine"" score would follow just a few months later). In fact, the climactic, 12-minute chase cue has to rank as one of Jarre's greatest in his esteemed career.Although it's a definite comedown from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is an admirable attempt at tweaking the formula established by its predecessors. Miller even manages to craft a surprisingly moving epilogue for the film as well, paying tribute to his late associate - producer Byron Kennedy - as the movie fades out and brings the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy to an emotionally satisfying close.With only the theatrical trailer as an extra, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome""'s Blu-Ray debut comes in the form of a highly detailed 1080p AVC encoded transfer. The DTS MA soundtrack packs an impressive punch when Jarre's score takes center stage, though it's unfortunate his final cue was dialed in so low in the original mix.With Miller having completed filming on ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (apparently due for release sometime in 2014), it'll be interesting to see how the eclectic filmmaker - who hasn't directed a live-action film not aimed at children in 20 years - returns to the film series he's most remembered for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230WDVBEI7LDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLRXDTQ#wasThisHelpful","R230WDVBEI7LDL","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After making a name for himself with the success of 1983's ""The Evil Dead,"" Sam Raimi teamed up with pals Robert Tapert, Bruce Campbell and a pair of fellow filmmaker friends - Joel and Ethan Coen, the former having worked on ""Evil Dead"" - for the ill-fated 1986 release ""Crimewave.""With ""Crimewave,"" Raimi opted to break away from gore and make a movie ""everyone could see."" Taking a page (kinda) from the Coen Brothers and their debut picture, ""Blood Simple,"" Raimi and the Coens concocted a zany affair that would utilize a pulpy plot involving a businessman trying to kill off his business partner, a pair of pet exterminators (""Popeye""'s Paul L. Smith and ""Blade Runner""'s Brion James) attempting to carry out the murder, and a nerdy employee ultimately framed for the crime.It might sound like something out of the Coen playbook, but ""Crimewave"" is really a cartoon - a manic, live-action, in-your-face cartoon with over-the-top humor and performances that certainly won't be for every viewer's taste (in fact, with a few more broadly-played gags, this could've done for pulp fiction what the ZAZ crew did to the disaster genre with ""Airplane!"" several years prior). Bruce Campbell generates a few laughs in a supporting role as an obnoxious heel, yet Bruce was supposed to be playing the film's centerpiece role - just one of many areas where studio interference from Embassy Pictures and its then owner, Norman Lear, caused a great deal of problems for Raimi and his crew.Maybe it's just the passage of time at play but I recall finding ""Crimewave"" to be a lot  funnier back when I was in high school. These days, its manic sensibilities come off as strident and overpowering (a little bit goes a long way), so I found the most enjoyable element of Shout's new Blu-Ray/DVD package to be its special features.Bruce Campbell's on-camera interview and commentary track, moderated by DVD extras guru Michael Felsher, are both hugely entertaining, not to mention insightful for any aspiring filmmaker. Bruce isn't afraid to dissect the film's problematic shoot and divulges countless anecdotes throughout the course of the track, while the trailer and a respectable 1080p transfer round out the combo pack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHD45WDMJO4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCMT1I2#wasThisHelpful","R3UHD45WDMJO4J","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the major cinematic disappointments of its day, the 1974 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" is likely to be reassessed by viewers in lieu of the release of Baz Luhrmann's upcoming, and obviously more flamboyant, version starring Leonardo DiCaprio that opens May 10th. The perfect way to do so is through Warner Home Video's gorgeous new Blu-Ray presentation that, if nothing else, plays to the film's visual strengths.Directed in an apathetic manner by Jack Clayton - whose career ranged from highlights like ""The Innocents"" to several disappointments including ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" - ""The Great Gatsby"" boasts a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who came into save the expensive Paramount/David Merrick production after Truman Capote's prior adaptation was vetoed by the studio. The film cast Robert Redford as the enigmatic title character, Mia Farrow as Gatsby's eternal flame - Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as her husband Tom, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway, Daisy's second cousin and a new arrival on the Long Island social scene circa 1925.Carraway, who narrates the film and serves as the story's social conscience, watches from a distance as the upper-crust of ""West Egg"" commits innumerable acts of selfishness, with Tom cheating on Daisy with the wife (Karen Black) of a local mechanic (Scott Wilson), and Daisy herself rekindling her lost love for the withdrawn Gatsby. As embodied by Redford, Gatsby is a tortured soul whose lavish parties are merely a facade for his emotional longing for Daisy's love. His desire to recapture the past dooms his future, with writer Coppola occasionally foreshadowing the tragedy that eventually befalls the vapid characters of Fitzgerald's novel.Coppola has written that Clayton paid scant attention to his screenplay, but while there's no question the film would've likely fared better with Coppola - at the time coming off the smash success of ""The Godfather"" - behind the lens, Clayton does capture enough of Coppola's adaptation that the movie isn't the total loss its reputation would lead you to believe. It's true that the movie's emotional aspect is detached from one end of the film to the other, and that the needed chemistry between Redford and Farrow never sparks (Farrow reportedly wrote that Redford's constant interest in the Watergate scandal kept him glued to the TV set whenever the cameras weren't rolling - something that may explain their lack of chemistry and Redford's disinterested performance). Scenes linger that should've been tightened up while Clayton keeps too much of the film on an even-keeled, dramatic flatline, and familiar faces from Edward Herrmann to Howard Da Silva (who also appeared in ""Gatsby""'s 1949 film version) appear in parts retained from the novel that don't offer any payoff on-screen.Yet ""The Great Gatsby"" still functions as an exquisitely good looking period film - a superficial romance that, despite its lack of emotional power, nevertheless manages to captivate for its sense of time and place. Making great use of  Newport, Rhode Island mansions like Rosecliff, Marble House and The Breakers (subbing for Long Island), Clayton and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe capture the gaudy heyday of the `20s in all its beauty and excess. And what more needs to be said about Nelson Riddle's Oscar-winning soundtrack? Beautifully adapted from numerous standards as well as offering an effective, low-key dramatic underscore, Riddle's work on ""The Great Gatsby"" is some of his finest. His use of George Gershwin's ""What I'll Do,"" weaving in and out of the score from the movie's first frames, is heartbreakingly poignant, and gives the film a soul that its otherwise overly-placid tone lacks. (Here's hoping someone releases Riddle's score on CD at some point soon).The movie's visual appearance, as well as its soundtrack, are both greatly enhanced by Warner's Blu-Ray presentation, which looks pleasingly natural with fine grain and detail present throughout (the details are so distinct you can easily see the old Jamestown [RI] Bridge in the movie's opening minutes). This is a beautiful 1080p AVC encoded presentation and another home run for Warner, releasing their first new title from the Paramount Pictures vaults as part of a recent catalog distribution agreement between the two studios. On the audio end, the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is surprisingly robust with a pleasing stereophonic presence.While those expecting ""The Great Gatsby"" to become the `70s equivalent of ""Gone With Wind"" were severely disappointed, the film is worthy of another look, and Warner's Blu-Ray gives ""Gatsby"" a stellar presentation that adds to its visual and aural appeal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0XKL05SJJK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJOMIW#wasThisHelpful","R3G0XKL05SJJK5","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A strong Shout! Factory Blu-Ray of Albert Pyun's comic-book production that was shot for Menahem Golan's post-Cannon Group 21st Century Film Corporation but never theatrically released.Matt Salinger (nephew of J.D.) plays Steve Rogers as he fights the Red Skull both in the `40s and again after he's frozen in time; Scott Paulin essays his arch-nemesis while a better-than-the-movie-deserves supporting cast includes Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin, Michael Nouri and Melinda Dillon. ""Captain America"" does move along briskly and has a few fun moments but is basically let down by threadbare production values (there's a WLVI TV-56 Boston microphone during a White House press briefing!) and terrible editing. Pyun further claims his film was ruined by Golan in post-production, but this charge isn't entirely supported by his recent so-called ""Director's Cut"" that the director sold a couple of years ago on his website (sadly I was dumb enough to buy a copy; the Blu-Ray version looked like some third-gen Youtube video!).Particularly compared to the dramatic stylings of Reb Brown (who played Rogers in a pair of failed '70s TV pilots), Salinger is actually quite good as Cap -- the movie is more about Steve Rogers than the man in the suit, and there are intermittent moments where the film is effective. Tolkin's script, meanwhile, hits many of the same narrative buttons as the recent Marvel movie, but needed a more seasoned director and a stronger budget for it to come together.Nevertheless, Shout's Blu-Ray goes a long way to making the '90 ""Captain America"" respectable. Previously available as a manufactured-on-demand DVD release that recycled its old home video master, Shout's Blu-Ray of ""Captain America"" is a vast improvement on any prior presentation of the picture. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer is detailed and satisfying, opening up the old 4:3 frame for a bolder, more colorful widescreen image that immediately enhances the cramped full-screen release of every prior transfer. The stereo sound is fine, and extras include a brand new, 20-minute featurette with Pyun and the good-natured Salinger lamenting the production's thrifty production values. Recommended for Marvel completists, and a reminder to younger viewers that those of us who grew up in the `80s often had to endure movies like this as our source of superhero entertainment - a far cry from the mega-budget, and hugely entertaining, big-screen comic book flicks of today.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIVVF7BTHWCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCMT49I#wasThisHelpful","R3GIVVF7BTHWCK","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For about 45 minutes, I could easily see why ""Cocktail"" bucked the ire of critics and was a summer-time smash: between Tom Cruise's charisma, a typically pop-tune laden Touchstone Pictures soundtrack, the movie's freewheeling ""80s plot"" of a young upstart making his way up the ladder of NYC's social circuit, and then a nice location switch to Jamaica, ""Cocktail"" has all the earmarks of simple, escapist fun.Unfortunately, right at the midway point, the movie collapses and turns into a hoary old melodrama that feels more in step with the '30s than the '80s -- Cruise meeting and falling for an NYC artist (Elisabeth Shue) harboring a secret, then reuniting with troubled bartender mentor Bryan Brown, cheating on Shue, returning to NYC...only to find out she's pregnant. There's more -- and it's all terrible, starting with the script falling into a number of laughably bad scenes (especially when Cruise gets chewed out by his ""cougar"" girlfriend and decks an artist at a posh gallery) and cringe-inducing lines of dialogue (Cruise explaining to Shue why he left her on the beach in Jamaica). Worst of all is Cruise's climactic ""confrontation"" with Shue's rich-snob father that almost comes off like a parody of itself.True, the movie does have a post-""Adventures in Babysitting"" Shue who's undeniably appealing, but it's easy to see why ""Cocktail"" made so many ""Worst Of 1988"" critical lists. This is a film that entirely coasts along on Cruise's post-""Top Gun"" popularity, to the extent where it's the only thing that explains its otherwise inexplicable box-office performance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27O5JQL4TXZ0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007G8MN0O#wasThisHelpful","R27O5JQL4TXZ0A","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her all in this extremely uneven independent film from director James Ponsoldt, who co-wrote ""Smashed"" with Susan Burke.Winstead plays an elementary school teacher who binges on booze with husband Aaron Paul. After a series of mishaps (vomiting in class, waking up hungover with no idea where her car is), Winstead decides to become sober, but not until she lies to her boss (Megan Mullally) with the excuse that she's pregnant after throwing up in front of her students. Unfortunately, sobriety comes at a price eventually, not only at work but with her relationship with her usually hung-over significant other.""Smashed"" is all over the place thematically - a few portions come across like outtakes from ""Bad Teacher,"" while other sequences have the feel of an improvised indie drama. Alas, with such a brief running time, almost nothing in the film is satisfactorily developed. Winstead's journey to becoming sober comes so easily that it feels more like a plot device than a fully explored theme, and her relationship with Paul is likewise hackneyed and predictable. The filmmakers also never give us a sense of why these two people were ever together to begin with - hampering the film's effectiveness - which leaves Winstead single-handedly to carry viewers along on an emotional rollercoaster that's never fully fleshed out. Thankfully, she's up to the challenge, bringing nuances and an emotional range that makes you care about her character's plight, even if the movie on balance fails to support her talents.Sony's Blu-Ray includes a number of deleted scenes (some of which might've helped the film's final third), commentary with Ponsoldt and Winstead, a Making Of, Toronto Film Festival Q&A/red carpet featurette, 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA 5.1 audio.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJR3NV255AKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2H9QYC#wasThisHelpful","R2YJR3NV255AKB","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After ""Westworld"" was released, producer Paul N. Lazarus III wanted to go ahead with a sequel, ""Futureworld."" However, with Crichton not being involved and MGM in the midst of some financial difficulties, the studio passed, leading the producers to head over to Samuel Z. Arkoff and his American-International Pictures, who gladly picked up the tab for the follow-up.The resulting FUTUREWORLD has the look and feel of a TV-movie, no surprise with small-screen vet Richard T. Heffron (""V: The Final Battle"") sitting in the director's chair. The far less inspired, though still involving, script follows reporters Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner as they try and uncover a conspiracy involving the Delos Corporation and their latest futuristic theme park, one that includes an outerspace component - thanks to some location shooting at the Johnson Space Center in Texas - and another roster of robots who just can't stay out of trouble.Fred Karlin returned to score ""Futureworld"" and musically gets much more to do here, churning out an effective `70s suspense score as opposed to the mostly western-flavored country soundtrack of its predecessor. ""Futureworld"" also attempts to craft a much more involved storyline here, but neither Fonda or Danner are interesting, and Yul Brynner contributes a weird cameo during a dream sequence that's particularly sad since it marked Brynner's final screen appearance. The cast is rounded out with familiar supporting faces (John P. Ryan, Arthur Hill, Stuart Margolin, even a cameo from Allen Ludden), but the movie's bloated running time makes one pine for the thrifty narrative Crichton instilled in ""Westworld.""While not as satisfying as ""Westworld,"" ""Futureworld"" is still a worthwhile view for `70s sci-fi fans, especially geeks nostalgic for the Tang-centric era of NASA exploration. Shout's Blu-Ray of ""Futureworld"" includes a just-about-acceptable 1080p transfer culled from the MGM vaults; there's some DNR on the image, but this isn't a particularly great-looking film to begin with (shot flat at 1.85, it doesn't have nearly the visual impact of its predecessor), so most fans will have to be content with its better-than-DVD enhancement. The mono sound is serviceable, and extras include radio spots and the original trailer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUX2RLV1JDRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJXO3S8#wasThisHelpful","REUX2RLV1JDRS","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long before the world visited ""Jurassic Park,"" Michael Crichton first laid the foundation for a pleasurable playground for the public where technology ran amok in WESTWORLD, a no-frills MGM sci-fi thriller that plays like an efficient ""B-movie"" with concepts the author/filmmaker would later expand upon - to even greater success - in his little novel about a theme park with living dinosaurs.Crichton's original script - which he directed himself - finds vacationers Richard Benjamin and James Brolin headed to a state-of-the-art theme park where guests plop down $1000 a night to live out a fantasy of their dreams at three distinct locations: Medieval World, Roman World, and Westworld. These attractions aren't populated merely with ""living history"" role players but rather android creations who are programmed to cater to every guest's desire or fantasy. Benjamin and Brolin find their Old West experience to be fairly run of the mill - cavorting with local ladies of the night, drinking in the saloon and playing poker - until they meet a Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) who displays tendencies that seem a bit more aggressive than they bargained for.With a sub-90 minute running time, ""Westworld"" has always felt like a film that could've used a bit more embellishment. The characters are paper-thin and the dramatic element of the film a bit undernourished to the point where we don't care really about Benjamin and Brolin's thrill-seekers since we know so little about them. That being said, ""Westworld"" is still extremely effective, particularly on repeat viewing since you're able to dial down your expectations and appreciate some of the prescient ideas Crichton was able to work into the film involving the public's ever-increasing appetite for thrills and technology that pushes boundaries to a dangerous degree. Brynner has little dialogue but brings a compelling physicality to his role of the robotic gunslinger, incorporating some eerie, blank expressions that Arnold Schwarzenegger would employ to a similar degree in ""The Terminator"" over a decade later.Shot in Panavision, ""Westworld"" has the look of quality even though it's clear the movie was shot with a modest budget. For that reason, it's hard to criticize first-time feature director Crichton too much here - this is an economical picture with a fast-moving second half and a premise that remains fascinating, so much so that it's surprising nobody has bothered to remake it (Crichton's own ""remake"" of sorts, ""Jurassic Park,"" notwithstanding).Making its Blu-Ray debut from Warner Home Video, ""Westworld"" looks a bit aged but delivers the HD goods thanks to a clear, crisp 1080p AVC encoded transfer. Little attempt was made here to hide the movie's grain structure, and that's a good thing, seeing as the transfer looks like real film and not a glossy DNR mess. The 5.1 DTS MA audio spreads out into full stereo when Fred Karlin's score kicks into gear, while extras include a vintage featurette, the trailer and - making its home video debut - the pilot for the (very) short-lived 1980 CBS series ""Beyond Westworld."" Apparently only five episodes of the show - which picks up with the Delos Corporation now trying to take over the world - were produced, and even fewer aired, with Connie Selleca playing the series' heroine only after she replaced the original female lead in the pilot. With laughable performances and indifferent production values, it's easy to see why ""Beyond Westworld"" didn't last, but its inclusion here - as a Blu-Ray exclusive - is more than welcome. (Now, if only WB had found some of the deleted scenes that made their way into ""Westworld""'s network TV broadcasts, we'd have a definitive package of the film!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJXJPL3J2E0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AATFJK2#wasThisHelpful","R3QJXJPL3J2E0V","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Backed by a budget augmented by Warner Bros. and producer Joel Silver, the Coen Brothers' THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ranked as one of the biggest box-office disappointments of 1994. Despite impressive physical production design by Dennis Gassner and Roger Deakins' exceptional cinematography, mainstream viewers had scant interest in the Coens' admittedly offbeat, and lightweight, ""big business fantasy"" that still remains a must for the filmmakers' devotees.Set in 1958, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" - scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen along with Sam Raimi - stars Tim Robbins as a midwestern college graduate who comes to the big city armed with large ambitions but no experience. He's able to nab a job in the mailroom of Hudsucker Industries, a company that's just seen its owner (Charles Durning) leap to his death from over 40 floors above, leaving the company in the hands of conniving Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman). Seeking to deplete the company's worth so its board members can purchase its stock for cheap, Mussburger puts Robbins' Norville Barnes in charge of the whole enterprise, not counting on Norville's grand plan - the hula hoop - becoming a worldwide sensation.Like many of the Coens' films, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is difficult to describe in terms of its genre classification. Its view of big-business comes off like a Coen riff on ""Mad Men,"" with corporate scheming viewed as an almost life-or-death struggle (quite literally in the film's climactic moments), while incorporating elements of a fairy tale and a romantic comedy for good measure. The latter is supplied by Jennifer Jason Leigh's newspaper reporter, who masquerades as a secretary for Norville but eventually falls for his irrepressibly naive charms. She sounds like she's out of a 1940s movie newsroom, and the Coens mix up the drawing-room machinations with memorable set-pieces that are eclectic and inventive (Norville's dream sequence with a tango dancer and a montage involving the hula hoop itself most notably among the latter).The movie doesn't entirely come together - and there are times it's not as funny as it would like to be - but it's such an endearing film that I've grown fonder of it with each viewing. The gently falling snow and brown-hued textures in Deakins' cinematography, the familiar supporting faces (Bruce Campbell, Steve Buscemi, Anna Nicole Smith and Jon Polito appear), and Carter Burwell's superb usage of Khachaturian compositions make for a movie that's a one-of-a-kind Coen experience through and through.Making its Blu-Ray debut exclusively from the Warner Archive, Warner's BD release is straightforward and satisfying. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer is as crisp as the film's visuals allow (its brown/greyish visual scheme will never make for an ""eye popping"" pallet), while the Dolby Stereo Spectral Recording soundtrack is encoded in a 2.0 DTS MA track. The movie's jaunty theatrical trailer, set to Danny Elfman's ""Back to School,"" does the best it can to sell the material to mainstream audiences, but the picture's most engaging elements are in its offbeat tone - one that's impossible to convey in a two-minute ad, much less a written review!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZ3Y72MVKI19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGDQNLU#wasThisHelpful","R2MZ3Y72MVKI19","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An iconic film that ushered in a whole new wave of animated blockbusters, Robert Zemeckis' box-office smash from the summer `88 was one of those movies -- much like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" - that people rushed out to see repeated times for its landmark visual achievements alone.Live action and animation were combined in a seamless, almost three-dimensional manner by animator Richard Williams and ILM for Zemeckis' frothy 1988 ""cartoon noir."" Based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, ""Roger Rabbit"" examines the craziness that ensues once alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant (the terrific Bob Hoskins) is hired to investigate the possible relationship between toon star Jessica Rabbit and cartoon guru Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). What Valiant finds is that Acme is murdered and all signs point to Jessica's husband -- cartoon star Roger Rabbit. With Roger in tow, pleading his innocence, Eddie reluctantly uncovers a seedy underworld buried beneath ""Toontown,"" where Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM stars hang out after hours at clubs and other secluded hideaways.An old-fashioned movie in more ways than one, ""Roger Rabbit"" was produced with hand-drawn animation and motion capture techniques that gave the animated characters a 3-D like appearance when set against live-action backdrops. That this process worked so much better here than in any prior attempt at mixing live-action and animation is entirely due to the craftsmanship of Zemeckis, Williams and particularly the ILM visual effects crew. Made in the pre-CGI era, the filmmakers relied on tried-and-true techniques in making their film come to life - they just did a more effective job than anyone else ever had, and their attention to detail still shines through in high-definition.""Roger Rabbit"" rightly copped several Oscars for its technical wizardry, which help compensate for a somewhat over-praised script (credited to Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman), which is never as compelling as the visceral element of the film. Hoskins' performance, though, is the glue that holds the movie together, and is rightly singled out by director Zemeckis in his audio commentary.Disney's Blu-Ray boasts what certainly looks like an unadulterated 1080p AVC encoded transfer that preserves the sometimes varied appearance of the film. Dean Cundey's golden-hued cinematography is like a love letter to post-WWII Hollywood, but because of all the special effects processes, grain is predictably more visible in some sequences than others. Given all the technical challenges involved in bringing the film to life, it's understandable, and for the most part, the transfer is quite good (and either way, it's unlikely the film will ever look better than it does here). The 5.1 DTS MA audio is active throughout, boasting an energetic and at-times bittersweet score by Alan Silvestri that ranks as one of his best.Extra features are cobbled together from prior DVD releases of the film, though most fans will be thrilled to learn that the set includes three remastered Roger Rabbit shorts that were released with other Disney films in the late '80s (""Tummy Trouble,"" ""Trail Mix-Up,"" and ""Rollercoaster Rabbit""). These shorts - the release of which apparently irritated producer Spielberg at the time (he wanted one of them playing in front of his Amblin co-produced ""Arachnophobia"") - look spectacular here, with glorious detail and color that's absent from the film itself.In addition to a 10-minute ""Making Of"" hosted by Roger's voice Charles Fleischer and aimed at kids, the BD rehashes other supplements from the 2003 DVD, including a full group audio commentary by Zemeckis, Frank Marshall, the writers, and ILM supervisor Ken Ralston; a 40-minute documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew;  split-screen comparisons of before-and-after FX footage; and the infamous ""Pig Head"" sequence, which was deleted from the film but added to CBS' network TV broadcasts in the early '90s. An accompanying DVD in the package (the same Disc 1 from the 2003 DVD in fact) also includes ""The Valiant Files,"" which compiles still photos from various stages of production, as well as the original theatrical trailer via an easter egg (select ""Movie Theater"" on the on-screen menu and press down four times to access it).""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of those dizzying, frantic Zemeckis films that pushed the technical boundaries of its day, remaining a favorite of both animation fans and fantasy aficionados. It's a shame that reported squabbles between Spielberg and Disney curtailed a long-in-development sequel (or prequel), which at one point was to have featured five original songs written by Alan Menken. While it's hard to think of another genre blockbuster to make as much money as ""Roger Rabbit"" and not generate a follow-up, the 1988 film is still a unique viewing experience that's lost none of its charm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NU4NZIWANV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO686MY#wasThisHelpful","R17NU4NZIWANV6","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For its technical accomplishments alone, Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI is likely to rank at the top of the list of 2012's best for many viewers, and there's no doubt from an artistic standpoint, its visuals were unmatched by any other film last year.An adaptation of Yann Martel's seemingly impenetrable rumination on the triumph of the human spirit, man's place in the universe, and the role of religion in an individual's spiritual journey, ""Life of Pi"" is, first and foremost, a film for the senses. Working from a script by David Magee, director Lee's film follows ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma), a young man who learns of different religions growing up in the Puducherry region of what was once French India. His inquisitive nature, both encouraged by his mother (Tabu) and discouraged by a father (Adil Hussain) who operates a zoo in their town, is scuttled as he grows older and his family is eventually forced to immigrate to Canada. En route, the Japanese freighter carrying them, as well as their zoo animals, is wrecked in a storm, with only Pi escaping - alongside a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, who journeys with Pi on an ocean teeming with both peril and wonder, with florescent jellyfish lighting up the world beneath them and humpback whales catapulting through the air.""Life of Pi"" is so staggeringly, jaw-droppingly beautiful that Lee and cinematographer Claudia Miranda's effective use of the 3-D format is evident from the movie's first frames. Long before Pi and Richard Parker set out on a lifeboat of individual discovery, ""Life of Pi"" has already captivated the viewer with its fascinating portrait of young Pi's life in French India, with gorgeous landscapes, colors and animals filling each and every frame. Most of the movies we see using 3-D employ it merely as a gimmick to goose grosses, but much like Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" Lee here frames so many sequences with depth-of-field dimension that its inclusion ranks as an absolute necessity to appreciating the spellbinding images that Lee and Miranda - both of whom were deservedly honored with Oscars, alongside composer Mychael Danna and the visual effects team at Rhythm & Hues - generated here.The film's story is another matter; one can easily see why readers of Martel's book were drawn to the material, for its mostly ambiguous, take-out-what-you-put-in take on world religion and faith, in general, functions mostly as a byproduct of the individual reader. On-screen, Lee is able to invest the material with a similar cloudiness, though that ambiguity is harder to achieve in a medium like film. There's no outright sermonizing in the picture, but its ending is more forcefully tilted in one direction than the more hazy conclusion Martel originally wrote. Still, however obvious (or not) the film's metaphorical messages and spiritual philosophizing happen to be, there's no question ""Life of Pi"" is a film that's impossible to forget and easy to appreciate on a sheer artistic level. Whether or not you find it to be as enriching an emotional journey will be - much like its source material - up to the individual viewer.Fox's 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of ""Life of Pi"" is unquestionably a must-view for any 3-D home theaterphile. The images, composition and clarity of the 3-D are spectacular throughout, and as I wrote before, few films have demanded viewing in the 3-D format more than ""Life of Pi."" The 3-D Blu-Ray also includes nearly 15 minutes of exclusive deleted scenes, plus the trailer in 3D and visual effects progressions (these exclusive extras can also be played in a standard BD player). Other supplements on the standard Blu (which features a dazzling 1080p AVC encoded transfer in its own right) boast several featurettes, an art gallery and storyboards, while a DVD and digital copy round out the disc. The DTS MA 7.1 audio is impressively mounted as well, highlighting another fine score written by Danna for his long-time cinematic collaborator.One final note on ""Life of Pi"": it's inconceivable to me that this picture generated a PG rating from the MPAA. With its marketing campaign dominated by images of Pi and the tiger together in the lifeboat, I have no doubt there were parents who took children to this film, only to be horrified by the animal violence that occurs in it - even if it's off-camera and isn't gratuitous, this isn't a film for young kids, and should've absolutely received a PG-13 for that and the generally intense tone of the picture. Of course, this isn't the first sign our ratings system is dysfunctional - merely the latest evidence of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37B87OUB17S4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB0Z88S#wasThisHelpful","R37B87OUB17S4N","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following the lackluster box-office returns of ""The Thing"" in 1982, director John Carpenter set his sights on an adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller CHRISTINE for a Christmas `83 release. While the film is structurally flawed - and just barely outperformed the disappointing box-office receipts of ""The Thing"" - it's a movie that nevertheless contains some of his best work, thanks to a reliance on character instead of gory horror.Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Phillips made mostly sound decisions in reworking King's novel for the screen, stripping out some of the more overtly supernatural elements and focusing on the relationship between its central characters: a high school nerd named Arnie (Keith Gordon) and his more popular, football-playing best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) in the late `70s. The perpetually bullied Arnie is teased by a ruthless clan of thugs but soon finds an outlet to escape his social status: a red 1958 Plymouth Fury that he buys from a shady salvage dealer (Roberts Blossom). Arnie sees in ""Christine"" the potential for a sleek cruising vessel that allows him to flee from his high school existence as well as his overly-concerned parents; Dennis, on the other hand, has grave concerns about his best friend's decision, but the connection between the possessed auto and its new owner has already been established. Soon Arnie's geek days are behind him as he snags the new girl in class (Alexandra Paul) and finds his rebirth is perpetually tied to the seemingly ""alive"" car he's rescued off the scrap heap.""Christine"" received some criticism from horror fans over the fact that it's not especially scary - but given the central premise of King's novel, it's hard to imagine what more Carpenter and Phillips could've done to make a ""killer car"" movie more terrifying. Individual shots of Christine, literally on fire, driving down a lonely highway in pursuit of one of the thugs who bullied Arnie earlier in the film are evocative, but the attempt to create and sustain a more psychological form of terror - through Arnie's personality shifting - was a laudable one on the part of the filmmakers. ""Christine"" takes its time - nearly 40 minutes - establishing the relationship between Arnie and Dennis, as well as setting the overall scene. These sequences are some of the most satisfying in Carpenter's entire body of work, with both Gordon and Stockwell coming across as likeable, believable characters.The movie's main weakness is clearly its second act, as Arnie's switch from hapless nerd to confident ladies man happens without a moment's notice. His relationship with Paul's heroine, Leigh, occurs completely off-screen - a severe miscalculation that serves as the largest misstep in Phillips' script, since without that component, it's hard to believe his overnight shift in confidence, or how it's tied into Christine itself. The movie also veers away from seeing the film through the prism of Dennis, who's sidelined with a serious football injury, and the change in perspective likewise curtails the movie's dramatic momentum. It's unfortunate the mid-section of the picture stumbles, because the latter portion of the movie mostly delivers the goods with Carpenter doing what he can to make Christine's killing spree effective, while the presence of veteran character actors like Robert Prosky, Roberts Blossom and Harry Dean Stanton (even if he's mostly underutilized as a detective) add to the entertainment value.""Christine"" may not be a great movie on balance - it's ultimately two-thirds of a really solid genre exercise - but it has its moments, and once you're aware of its shortcomings, repeat viewing makes it easier to appreciate the elements in it that do work well. In a career filled with a couple of classics (""Halloween"" and ""The Thing""), cult favorites and more than a few missed opportunities, it's also one of Carpenter's more low-key thrillers, reliant less on gore (the film is R-rated for excessive profanity as opposed to on-screen violence) and with more of an accent on the people affected by its horrors than the vehicle itself.Announced as one of Twilight Time's March limited-edition Blu-Ray releases, ""Christine"" sold out in a matter of hours once its pre-order went live on the Screen Archives website. The prior bestseller for Twilight Time was ""Fright Night"" - clearly, there's something to be said for the continued popularity of `80s genre films as ""Christine"" was snapped up in a jiffy by eager fans. If you're looking for a copy now, the secondary market is your only option, and prices currently run from $100 and up (barring an overseas, region-free release, it's likely its value may only increase as copies become scarcer).The 1080p AVC encoded transfer licensed from Sony is hugely satisfying, enhancing the work of Carpenter and cinematographer Donald M. Morgan, which is marked by Carpenter's trademark use of Panavision widescreen. The DTS MA 5.1 audio is potent as well, delivering a score filled with period rock tunes and one of the more unobtrusive Carpenter/Alan Howarth collaborations (there's hardly any of their underscore at all in the first hour). Extras are carried over from the Special Edition DVD, including Laurent Bouzereau's insightful three-part documentary, nearly 30 minutes of deleted scenes (none of which would've really helped the movie's middle section), and a fun commentary with Carpenter and Keith Gordon. For folks lucky enough to find a copy, this is a splendid Blu-Ray presentation all around, capped by an isolated score track of Carpenter and Howarth's musical contribution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PN97JWBNXEXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQLSB3A#wasThisHelpful","R1PN97JWBNXEXN","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Fenton's terrific score anchors this spectacular BBC documentary from the same creative team that would later produce ""Planet Earth,"" including host David Attenborough and producer Alastair Fothergill. BBC's 1080p transfer of their acclaimed 2001 ""Blue Planet"" mini-series still offers breathtaking footage of life under and just above the surface, from dolphins and killer whales to seal pups and baby turtles - the latter groups fighting to stay away from predators.However, because the BBC's Blu-Ray presentation has been mastered from a standard-definition source (and is clearly stated as such on the back cover, albeit in tiny print), the upscaled presentation varies greatly from certain sequences that nearly look HD in quality (the film based portions), to others that are clearly derived off video elements and display jaggies and other issues (i.e. much of the underwater footage). Either way, none of the transfer is actually presented in high-def -- so consumers will have to determine for themselves whether this upscale is enough of an upgrade over the prior DVD release to justify the purchase (I don't have the DVD to compare it with). Five bonus programs, interviews with Fothergill and other crew members, 80 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage and DTS MA 5.1 soundtracks round out the release.ADDITIONAL NOTES - There seems to be a misconception that BLUE PLANET was entirely filmed on 16mm film stock. I refer readers to this 2002 in-depth article on the production of BLUE PLANET and its HD mastering, which includes interviews with the producers and presents evidence to the contrary:[...]It clearly states ""the source material varied from a wide range of film and video formats,"" says that ""a significant percentage of the original material was shot on video,"" and goes onto state ""having so much video footage interspersed with the film footage was a change that presented a particular challenge in providing a seamless transfer to HD.""So not all of it was shot on film stock. Underwater portions, which I mentioned were derived from a video source, is also confirmed in this article: ""however, for many of the underwater sequences it was important to give a sense of speed, so video running at 50i was more appropriate. Shooting video underwater is also easier because the cameras are smaller, and you can spend more time filming before you have to change rolls"". There are jaggies and other problems all throughout this transfer IN those moments that are derived not from 16mm but video sources -- clearly upconversion artifacts.Perhaps it was too daunting a task for them to track down every last bit of footage and remaster it for HD. The author of the article even asks the BBC rep why the whole production ""wasn't shot in HD to begin with,"" which implies that not every scrap of footage was either shot on film or an HD-based video format. Keep in mind this production was filmed in the late '90s when it was not cost-prohibitive for crews to all be carrying HD cameras around (which is also stated in the article).Either way, the fact is that this transfer -- all of it, including the film based portions -- is a standard-def upconvert, and is confirmed as such on the packaging itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNFWT7Y4XODV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBXTS94#wasThisHelpful","R1TNFWT7Y4XODV","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Animator Ralph Bakshi's feature films are a wildly uneven assortment of psychedelic colors, ethnic stereotypes and ribald humor - elements of which haven't quite translated into the 21st century. After breaking out with ""Fritz the Cat"" and ""Heavy Traffic,"" Bakshi found himself being courted by major studios, but two of his subsequent projects - ""Coonskin,"" produced for Paramount, and the Warner Bros.-backed ""Hey Good Lookin'"" - would end up being shuttled off to another studio in the case of the former and delayed for years in the case of the latter.In fact, HEY GOOD LOOKIN' (75 mins., 1982, R) was originally produced as a live-action/animated mix in the mid `70s. According to reports, indifferent test screenings and the controversy over ""Coonskin"" caused Warner to shelve the project for years, during which time Bakshi generated box-office paydirt with ""Wizards"" and his ""Lord of the Rings"" animated adaptation. Looking to capitalize on the latter's success, Warner opted to dump ""Hey Good Lookin'""s live-action footage and have the film fully animated. The resulting feature was finally completed in 1982, a year after Columbia's release of ""American Pop,"" one of Bakshi's most satisfying features.""Hey Good Lookin'"" doesn't rate as one of Bakshi's better films, yet this tale of a Brooklyn greaser and his various adventures in the mid `50s has its moments - including an opening conversation between two pieces of trash (!), a wild finale, and a tuneful song-soundtrack by Ric Sandler and John Madara that's the best thing in the film. Of course, the movie also includes some grotesquely drawn stereotypes and humor that often misses the mark; like a lot of Bakshi's work, ""Hey Good Lookin'"" isn't going to be for every taste, and overall, ranks as a minor work from the controversial animator. Still, for adventurous viewers, the movie is worth seeing, as are many of the filmmaker's audacious attempts at using the artform as a vehicle for adult storytelling - especially at a time when Bakshi was one of the only animators trying to do so.Making its first appearance on home video since a VHS release in the `80s, ""Hey Good Lookin'"" is presented in its 77-minute 1982 version. Although Bakshi's original `70s version remains in the Warner vaults (and it's a shame the studio didn't see fit to releasing it here), fans will have to make due with this DVD presentation for the moment, and it's certainly a solid presentation, enhanced for 16:9 televisions. The print shows its age at times but generally conveys the spectrum of colors in Bakshi's animation; the original trailer, comprised of just one scene of ""Vinnie"" using Vitalis, is the sole extra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNUKG00GH9LBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWQTUTS#wasThisHelpful","RNUKG00GH9LBO","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a lot of things that were good in small doses (Jeff Goldblum springing into the lead role in ""The Lost World"" being one of them), Judd Apatow's decision to spin the scene-stealing coupling of Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann from ""Knocked Up"" into their own film is a near-total misfire.An aimless - and interminably long - comedic-drama that falls in line with Apatow's increasingly unsatisfying recent fare, ""This is 40"" follows Rudd and Mann as both hit the 40 milestone, trying to work through all kinds of issues both big and small in their lives in Southern California. In fact, Apatow spends the first hour populating his original script with an endless succession of self-contained scenes with the couple sparring over finances, Rudd's father (Albert Brooks), their kids' preoccupation with electronic devices, and lack of sexual spark. Eventually ""drama"" kicks in when Mann learns she's pregnant again and Rudd's latest record fails to generate sales - but outside of a Melissa McCarthy cameo, nearly all of ""This is 40"" just sits there and dies on-screen. Rudd and Mann are both likeable performers, but their endless complaining in the film grates after just a few minutes -- I'm sure Apatow thought this would bring an ""authentic"" element to the film, but there end up being so many issues involving their relationship, and their respective parents, that it's hard to understand why this couple is together at all. Ultimately ""This is 40"" is as annoying and obnoxious as the behavior of its lead characters, and leaves you feeling as if you've actually spent 40 years in their company.Universal's Blu-Ray release of ""This is 40"" includes both the original R-rated theatrical cut and an unrated version featuring an additional three minutes. The 1080p transfer and DTS MA soundtrack are both fine.

"Sometimes there exists a disconnect between what audiences and critics happen to see. IDENTITY THIEF, a perfectly entertaining comedy/road trip flick from Seth Gordon, is one of those instances. This year's first $100-million grossing film has taken critical brickbats and has even seen Rex Reed tear apart Melissa McCarthy's weight (nice going Rex -- plenty of things I can say about you but won't!), but the film itself is a crowd pleaser: good natured, funny in places, with solid chemistry between McCarthy as the frizzy haired title character and Jason Bateman as the hapless working man whose identity she steals. She's great, and the movie does enable her to do something more than play the ""crazy big woman"" in its second half, with some effective dramatic beats. Bateman is game too, and while the film isn't hilarious or particularly memorable, it is highly enjoyable especially if you like road-trip flicks with mismatched characters. Certainly there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours at the movies, which is exactly the type of thing that ""Identity Thief"" functions well as -- a decent timekiller with the two leads playing off each other extremely well. No wonder why viewers have enjoyed it for what it is instead of critics like Rex Reed, who needs to get over himself -- and get a life on top of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y6X629RWBHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNMA3A#wasThisHelpful","R35Y6X629RWBHI","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Silent film enthusiasts ought to be thrilled with Criterion's release of LONESOME, a 1928 Universal feature from director Paul Fejos, a unique Hungarian who also, in addition to filmmaker, counted doctor and anthropologist among his many lifelong pursuits.The film's subject matter isn't anything out of the ordinary for the genre - ""Lonesome"" tells the story of a lonely man (Glenn Tryon) and equally single woman (Barbara Kent) living in the urban chaos of New York City, who find one another while on an outing to Coney Island but then become separated when a fire breaks out on one of the rollercoasters. What makes ""Lonesome"" fascinating are the real locations matched with Fejos' ahead-of-its-time direction, which employs a moving, ""inquisitive"" camera, plus color-tinted sequences, unconventional editing and even several sound sequences that were added after the fact to appeal to Hollywood's transition out of the silent era.Those dialogue sequences may be limp, but the film itself otherwise is one of the more unusual silent films I've ever seen: instead of being static and stilted, the picture has an energy that's a testament to Fejos' style, in addition to an interesting, overriding theme of individuals being lost in the day-to-day world of contemporary life -- something that gives the film a timelessness that holds true today.A film festival favorite, ""Lonesome"" makes its home video debut with Criterion's Blu-Ray release (also on DVD). The 1080p B&W/color tinted 1.33 transfer is quite good given the extensive restoration performed on the picture, with a fascinating commentary from historian Richard Koszarski; a reconstructed sound version of Fejos' 1929 musical ""Broadway,"" with its all-color finale intact; Fejos' 1929 silent ""The Last Performance"" with Conrad Veidt; a 1963 visual essay on Fejos' life from Paul Falkenberg; an interview with Hal Mohr about the ""Broadway"" camera crane; and extensive booklet notes all included on the supplemental side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXU0PAYWOKBVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083V2VZK#wasThisHelpful","RXU0PAYWOKBVP","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BLU-RAY REVIEW: While I haven't been a big admirer of most of the films adapted from Nicholas Sparks books, there's just something appealing about ""The Lucky One,"" a well-made adaptation of one of Sparks' countless romantic tomes from ""Shine"" director Scott Hicks.Zac Efron is much better than anticipated here as a U.S. army vet, trying to readjust to life after three tours of duty in Iraq, who sets out to find his ""guardian angel"": a torn photograph of a lovely young blonde that he found in the rubble during combat. Efron's journey takes him to a gorgeous Louisiana seaside community (mistakenly listed as North Carolina on the disc's packaging) where the girl turns out to be a divorced mom (Taylor Schilling) trying to recuperate on her own from the death of her brother and her fractured relationship with an abrasive ex-husband (Jay R. Ferguson). The two forge an immediate relationship but her emotional issues and the presence of her ex threaten both of their futures.""The Lucky One"" provides few surprises - this is basically a standard romantic drama not unlike any Hallmark Channel original movie - but what makes the film work is the overall quality of the filmmaking and its appealing performances. Efron and Schilling generate an awful lot of chemistry together here, and both provide likeable characterizations that make it easy for viewers to pull for them. What's more, Hicks' fine lensing - complete with color-drenched cinematography by Alar Kivilo - raises the material a notch above most of the prior Sparks films, while Mark Isham's truly superb score (sadly unreleased as of yet) adds a further emotional layer to the entire picture. Though no classic, as ""date movies"" and recent romantic dramas go, ""The Lucky One"" is one of the best I've seen in some time.Warner brings ""The Lucky One"" to Blu-Ray in the form of a combo pack also offering a DVD and Ultraviolet copy. Extra features are fairly lightweight here, comprised of three featuretes, while the disc technically is capped by a splendid 1080p transfer that really makes the visuals sing along with a 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1041DLZN8YXEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9EK1S#wasThisHelpful","R1041DLZN8YXEP","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lavish, entertaining fantasy adaptation of Grimms' fairy tale from first-time feature director Rupert Sanders is a huge upgrade from the frivolous Julia Roberts film ""Mirror, Mirror.""Kristen Stewart is Snow in this dark, compelling version fashioned by writers Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. In their decidedly serious take on the subject, Snow's father is murdered by her new stepmother (Charlize Theron), who promptly imprisons his daughter until she's able to break free and seek refuge in the dark forest. Needing her back, alive, Theron's Queen sends a washed-up huntsman (""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth) after her, though he questions her motivations -- as well as his own -- after he runs into the young heroine.Happily eschewing the CGI'd green-screen approach of so many other, recent genre films, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" benefits enormously from its real-world UK location shooting. The film looks like an actual, lived-in environment, and its ""realistic"" visuals are matched by equally strong performances, especially from Theron (in one of her juiciest roles) and Hemsworth, who does some nice work in a scene with the cursed Snow late in the film. For her part, Stewart does as much with the character of Snow White as the script allows - I bought her in Snow's empathetic scenes with the natural world, but she doesn't really have much to do in comparison with the other leads. There are also the dwarves, here played by a collection of character actors CGI'd to smaller proportions (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone among them), but the film doesn't do nearly enough with that concept as it should have.The plot itself is surprisingly rich and traditional - not in terms of it being a fairy tale, but rather an old-fashioned cinematic fantasy-adventure - and is backed by impressive cinematography, costumes, and a satisfying mix of character and action. Sanders draws you in and lets the film breathe, and while there are CGI beasts, the film's emotional draw is human - rather than technical - in nature, and ends on a particularly satisfying beat (with a robust James Newton Howard score). Even more satisfying than the likes of ""Willow"" and ""Dragonslayer,"" this ""Snow White"" is a surprisingly good ""revisionist"" take of the oft-told tale on nearly every level.Universal brings ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" to Blu-Ray on September 11th in a combo pack featuring both the theatrical version and a slightly extended, 132-minute unrated cut. Extra features are fairly light - just a few making Of featurettes and commentary are on-hand - but the transfer (1080p AVC) is terrific, as is the DTS MA audio.

"Blake Edwards' 1960 Fox comedy HIGH TIME finds Bing Crosby's hamburger-restaurant chain entrepreneur deciding to head back to campus and get his college degree. As the elder statesman on campus, Bing quickly becomes popular with his roommates (including Richard Beymer and Fabian), romances a French teacher (Nicole Maurey) and finds the time to dress up in drag and croon a future standard in the process.Though written by Edwards' frequent collaborators Tom and Frank Waldman, ""High Time"" doesn't have a whole lot of slapstick antics (there's just that one bit where Bing crossdresses as part of a fraternity initiation - something that's never as amusing as it sounds). The movie is sweet and goes down nice and easy as a product of its era, but it also feels flimsy - like a book for a musical without any songs. Yes, Bing does briefly croon ""The Second Time Around,"" a lovely Sammy Cahn-James Van Heusen tune written for the film, but the movie really could've used some more musical interludes seeing as most of the film is comprised of basic, albeit peppy, montages. There's not much in the way of drama or character development here - just a series of self-contained scenes set over the course of Bing's four years at an ACC institution dubbed ""Pinehurst College"" (standing in for Wake Forest, where the film was reportedly supposed to be shot until the production decided to stay closer to home in California).The supporting cast has its charms: Gavin MacLeod has some fun early on as a manic science teacher, a pre-""Batgirl"" Yvonne Craig plays an intrepid school journalist, and Tuesday Weld brings her warm smile as the gang's resident gal pal, but there's no real pay off to their (or any other) roles, with the movie settling for a cartoony treatment of the subject matter without much development or even laughs (in fact, Rodney Dangerfield would have much more success in the latter department in his similarly-themed 1986 hit ""Back to School"").Now, although it probably sounds as if I'm being a bit harsh on ""High Time,"" I still enjoyed the film. Edwards' direction utilizes some visual flourishes that would come to characterize his later comedies, and Henry Mancini's wonderful score is so infectious that I was humming the main theme for some time afterwards. All it needed was a few good musical numbers to put it over the top.The 1080p AVC encoded, Fox-sourced HD transfer is perfectly acceptable on balance - the elements are certainly in better condition than ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" another Fox Cinemascope TT release, yet the image has some obvious digital filtering applied and doesn't appear nearly as vibrant as TT's recent Blu-Ray of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" (the colors also don't leap off the screen as they do in TT's counterpart release this month). The  DTS MA stereo sound is just fine, with a stereo isolated score track of Mancini's score also available on a separate channel. The original trailer and Julie Kirgo's notes put the finishing touches on another Twilight Time 3000-copy limited edition Blu-Ray.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LOLRQA0PO05I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090V4IPI#wasThisHelpful","R2LOLRQA0PO05I","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mid to late August has perennially been a weak time for new theatrical releases. When I was growing up, it was always the dumping grounds for expected hits that studios shuffled away in full acknowledgment that they weren't the films they were supposed to be (hello, ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace""). These days, some minor hits have popped up in the waning days of August, and this year has produced another sleeper: screenwriter David Koepp's exciting PREMIUM RUSH.A tidy, edge-of-your-seat thriller that recalls Kevin Bacon's `80s misfire ""Quicksilver"" in premise only, ""Premium Rush"" likewise follows a NYC bike messenger - here superbly portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who's been charged with delivering a parcel to Chinatown...one that NYPD cop Michael Shannon is highly interested in. Trying to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, Gordon-Levitt darts in and out of midtown traffic, trying to figure out what he's carrying and help out a college acquaintance - a young Chinese woman - whose life seems to be riding on the outcome of his delivery.I've long criticized some of Koepp's scripts for high profile summer movies (particularly his efforts for Steven Spielberg, including the underwhelming ""War of the Worlds"" and""The Lost World: Jurassic Park""), but ""Premium Rush"" - written with John Kamps - ranks as one of his tightest, and most satisfying, screenplays, managing to mix a fast-moving action film with a twisty, compelling story that packs more of an emotional punch than anticipated. The authentic locations add immeasurably to the film's many scenes of Gordon-Levitt and his fellow bikers being an inch or two away from certain disaster, maneuvering through a maze-like succession of traffic, pedestrians and lousy Big Apple drivers; Koepp the director, meanwhile, deftly mixes in flashbacks to tell a story that works just perfectly in the short, 90-minute time frame employed here.""Premium Rush"" didn't make much noise in theaters this past weekend, and seemed to fly under the radar completely in terms of most viewers' pre-release awareness (I hadn't even heard of the film until it opened Friday). That's unfortunate, because it's the complete opposite of the bloated, overlong $200 million typical blockbuster most studios are interested in these days.

"For exploitation fans, horror nuts and 3-D enthusiasts, you couldn't find a more fitting film to unofficially end the summer season with than PIRANHA 3DD, the gleefully bad, junky sequel to Alexandre Aja's 2010 hit which - despite its token theatrical release last May - seems to have been shot with the small-screen in mind to begin with.This time out, the prehistoric piranhas have moved along to another group of underground lakes in Arizona, just in time for the relaunch of a water theme park run by college grad Danielle Panabaker and her resident, obnoxious stepfather David Koechner. Having tapped into the water supply where the piranhas are swimming about, ""The Big Wet Water Park"" is about to be the site of yet another bloody massacre once the piranhas arrive - about the same time as David Hasselhoff, playing himself as he hits ""rock bottom"" as the attraction's big guest star.Aja's original ""Piranha"" was an over the top, almost cheerful exercise in horror mayhem, and it's surprising - given the film's success - that the Weinsteins decided to go the cheap route with producing a follow up. Veterans of Dimension's home video sequels including director John Gulager and producer Joel Soisson were brought in to make ""Piranha 3DD"" on a clearly reduced budget, with notably diminished make-up effects (gorehounds will surely be disappointed by the reduction of severed heads and limbs here) and a B-list, younger cast (Christopher Lloyd does show up, briefly reprising his role from the original; so does Ving Rhames, who wisely opted to go uncredited under the circumstances).Make no mistake, ""Piranha 3DD"" isn't anything close to resembling a good movie, but once you realize this is essentially a trashy direct-to-video sequel - and acknowledge the diminished set of expectations that comes with the territory - the film still provides a modest amount of entertainment. This is especially true when it comes to Hasselhoff's involvement, which yields several big laughs (no more so than when the aging star, in lifeguard gear, runs to aid an obnoxious young boy to the strains of the ""Baywatch"" theme). The 3-D isn't anything spectacular - and the thrills never come close to matching the epic carnage of its predecessor - but the movie still provides a fast assortment of corpses, T&A and the occasional cameo from a genre character actor (in addition to Lloyd, Rhames, and ""The Hoff,"" Gary Busey is offed in a weak opening sequence). It also wraps things up at around the 70-minute mark and adds some 10 minutes of amusing bloopers that roll over the end credits. It's not good, but it's certainly fun if you can get into the right mindset.Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray combo pack (3D, 2D and DVD) of ""Piranha 3DD"" includes a generally good 1080p MVC encoded 3-D transfer. There's ghosting in the image during the Busey sequence, but from that point forward, the natively-shot 3-D looks fine - the issue is that the 3-D isn't particularly well utilized by Gulager, so few effects stand out. The DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack is sound, and extras (on the 2D Blu-Ray) include commentary by Gulager, a couple of deleted scenes, a few featurettes with Hasselhoff, Koechner and Busey, and a worthless four-minute Michael Ratner ""comedy"" short, ""A Lesson with John McEnroe.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKMOG3BQJPNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZW6U#wasThisHelpful","R3DKMOG3BQJPNN","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the mid `90s, the Disney studio excised a pair of songs from two of their releases - ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" - that both negatively impacted the theatrical versions of each film. The reasoning was simple: the songs in question (""When Love Is Gone"" from the Muppets and ""If I Never Knew You"" from ""Pocahontas"") were too ""adult"" in nature, leading some parents to take their kids out to the snack bar or the bathroom to avoid sitting in their seats for the 3-4 minutes those respective numbers were on-screen.It didn't matter that the songs were vital to each movie - comprising arguably the most dramatic moments of both stories - or that anyone other than a restless five-year-old wouldn't have had a problem sitting through them. The editing shears were out, and neither song would appear in the theatrical release of either picture. Flash-forward several months. Once ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" hit video, director Brian Henson insisted on the restoration of ""When Love Is Gone,"" and the song was thankfully added into all video releases of the 1992 production (though sadly not its later DVD release). ""Pocahontas,"" sadly, would not have its climactic song restored until a 10th Anniversary DVD release in 2005.Unfortunately, that song - Alan Menken's lovely ""If I Never Knew You"" - is once again absent from the Blu-Ray of POCAHONTAS, which has just arrived in a BD/DVD double-pack with its inferior direct-to-video sequel ""Pocahontas II: Journey To a New World.""It doesn't matter that the movie is one of the weaker Disney productions from the `90s, or that the Politically Corrected-story has numerous holes. ""Pocahontas"" still manages to modestly entertain in spite of its flaws primarily because of its gorgeous score by Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, encompassing ""The Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend."" Alas, for whatever reason, Disney has once more opted not to include the longer version with ""If I Never Knew You,"" a duet between Pocahontas (sung by Judy Kuhn) and John Smith (a surprisingly effective vocal performance by Mel Gibson), sung near the conclusion of the film.Without ""If I Never Knew You,"" ""Pocahontas"" essentially has no climax. The movie's sometimes jumbled story - with its one dimensional villains (gasp! That evil governor of Virginia is a nasty one!!) - and confused perspective on the Pocahontas-Smith relationship reeks of the P.C. police, and minus the duet, the film also doesn't flow properly, with a particularly abrupt final third. It's a problematic but interesting entry in the Disney canon, boasting some of Menken's finest work and one of the nicest love themes you'll ever hear in an animated movie - but, as was the case with the theatrical release, it's been relegated once again to a mere end credits pop duet between Jon Secada and Shanice.With its crisp and beautiful new Blu-Ray remastering, the movie has, at least,  never looked better on the small screen. The film's bold colors and striking animation are superlatively rendered, while the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is likewise effective in conveying the rich musical texture of the soundtrack. Extras (in addition to standard DVD copies) are mostly reprisals of material found in Disney's deluxe CAV LaserDisc box set of ""Pocahontas"" (likewise carried over to the 2005 DVD). These include commentary with the filmmakers (recorded in 2003) and plenty of featurettes - albeit some of them only available through Disney's online ""Virtual Vault"" (requiring a BD Live connection). Adding insult to injury is that ""If I Never Knew You"" is indeed present as a supplement - and in full HD - making it even more frustrating the song couldn't have been included, as an option, to view integrated within the movie itself.""Pocahontas"" may always be viewed as somewhat of a black sheep, particularly compared with the high quality of Disney's theatrical output from the `90s, and it's unfortunate that the improvement yielded by including ""If I Never Knew You"" has been negated by the bad decision to drop it from this package. Hopefully the same situation won't repeat itself when ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" arrives on Blu-Ray later this year.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMQ97XZTH25G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084IHVIY#wasThisHelpful","R2RMQ97XZTH25G","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Splendid Blu-Ray pairing of the 1977 Disney favorite ""The Rescuers"" - now celebrating its 35th Anniversary - with its underappreciated, beautifully drawn 1990 sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"" has arrived on Blu-Ray in a BD/DVD Disney combo pack. The original ""Rescuers"" is a gentle kids animated feature - slight but still endearing - and the 1990 ""Down Under"" was noteworthy for being one of the last Disney animated efforts that would be made without songs for a number of years to come. It still has, musically, a brilliant score by Bruce Broughton, however, that ranks with his best, as well as some fleeting uses of computer animation. Both films look colorful and detailed in Disney's 1080p AVC encoded transfers, though it's clear neither was treated to the kind of digital restoration other films of their respective eras have been. Extras include, on ""The Rescuers,"" a deleted song, a bonus short (""Three Blind Mouseketeers""), and a 1990 vintage Making Of for the sequel.

"Ross Hunter's 1970 box-office smash ignited a whole genre of ""disaster movies"" that followed throughout the `70s, including three sequels of its own. No question the move to high-definition adds to the appeal of this George Seaton-scripted adaptation of Arthur Hailey's bestseller, with the movie's Todd-AO cinematography appearing more detailed and impressive in Universal's solid 1080p AVC encoded transfer - the colors and contrasts are nicely balanced, with good detail and maybe just a hint of filtering that doesn't get in the way of the image. Not much in the way of extras here: just two ""100 Years of Universal"" featurettes and the original trailer are on-hand, though the DTS MA 5.1 audio does a capable job rendering Alfred Newman's excellent score.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZS2JNFP7T2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ZG7LG#wasThisHelpful","R2JZS2JNFP7T2N","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet, lovely comedy, adapted from Mary Chase's play by the author and Oscar Brodney, gave Jimmy Stewart one of his signature roles as kindly Elwood P. Dowd - the good-natured bachelor whose best friend is a six-foot tall-plus rabbit who appears only to him. Hollywood has tried numerous times over the years to remake ""Harvey"" (most recently with Steven Spielberg expressing interest), but there's an innocence and playfulness in Henry Koster's 1950 film that's going to be impossible for anyone to recapture. Universal's 1080p AVC encoded transfer is another winner, offering good detail (and a happy lack of DNR) in its crisp B&W image. Extras include an introduction from Jimmy Stewart that was filmed for the early `90s video release, plus two more Universal 100 Years featurettes (the Carl Laemmle Era, the Lew Wasserman Era), plus a DVD, digital copy and the theatrical trailer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7K45R5J8CWYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TTC5JK#wasThisHelpful","R7K45R5J8CWYD","A2JDYUSI2RILEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JDYUSI2RILEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Remember all those years ago when the first (chronological time, not story time) Stars Wars episode came to the big screen? How awesome! How exciting to view such imaginative and bold story telling. When I happened upon this new edition (Sept 2015) in the children's section, I readily bought the book and slam read through it. Many details were new to me (or new again). I thrilled to re-learn the story of Darth Vader.But more than for me, I bought this book for my great-niece and -nephew, 8 and 6. They don't know the Star Wars story, but their dad does. He will be delighted to see this collection of Star Wars items that will introduce a new generation of children to Star Wars, one of our great mythic pieces of literature/movie-making.What I particularly like about this DK Readers book is the absolute thoroughness of content that Author Catherine Saunders has brought to this Level 3 reader. (Level 3 means that the child can read alone complex stories that build confidence.) The back cover has this teaser: ""Discover the story of a talented young Jedi who turns to the dark side....""The 64-page book is divided into chapters that end with a glossary, index, and guide for parents. Chapters include information supportive of the story of Darth Vadar, including both sides of The Force. Do you remember that Anakin Skywalker (the future Darth Vadar) built C-3PO? Jedi Knights are explained: their training, their problems, and their requirements. Did Anakin muster the material of the soul to be a Jedi? The Dark Side is explained, as well as Anakin's turn to this force.I ask this question: What child can resist a story about a powerful young person, especially when he goes wrong and sees the consequences?

"What's the latest slogan? ""Black lives matter"" could be the theme of ""Lila and Eve,"" but not quite. It's not enough. What's enough is to take seriously, very seriously, a mother's grief and anger especially when the police seem to be coasting when a black life is taken. So, in the end, all is not what it seems. Black lives do matter, and Puerto Rican lives, even in overwhelmingly frequent murders being investigated by too few police officers.That said, Viola Davis is the focus character, a grieving mother over the loss of her older son, and Jennifer Lopez is the voice of action, whatever it takes, to seek revenge and resulting satisfaction in that revenge for the death of her daughter. They meet at a support group for mothers of slain children. This group becomes pivotal to the plot several times and shows exactly what the word ""support"" means.I find Viola Davis a fascinating actor. She is not classically beautiful nor does she wear makeup that makes her beautiful as female actors are wont to do, especially in movies. She actually looks as if she lives an ordinary life in a lower class neighborhood, thus she fits the role. Jennifer Lopez does the same. No glamour here.The only weak link is Shea Whigham, who plays the detective investigating the son's murder. I didn't like the askance glances he employs in speaking to people, particularly Lila, Davis's character.  Other reviewers mention the surprise twist (which did surprise me). It makes Lila seem more believable and human.Modern America, with its drugs and drive-by killings, is on trial in ""Lila and Eve."" While the verdict in this one case may be satisfying on some levels, there is the question of moral and ethical turpitude. The indictment is not toward the police or toward vigilantes, but toward the extremely far direction America has come to reach the level explored in this film. It should open frank discussions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0CXKR5BZTXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWV8W6I#wasThisHelpful","R3N0CXKR5BZTXJ","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My brother and I keep a running tally of romantic movies we both love:  ""50 First Dates,"" ""Overboard,"" ""Born Yesterday"" (Melanie Griffith), ""Knight and Day."" Now I am adding ""The Outsider."" The embrace after her begging for forgiveness before the church crowd is so powerful! So much so, that I just ordered the movie. Like others who reviewed this movie, I want to be able to see it over and over. Then I might hand it over to my brother.So, what makes a western about a gunslinger so romantic? So many things come together to make a memorable romance. The choice of actors is the main one for me. Tim Daley! He's been a favorite of mine ever since ""Wings,"" though his performance in ""Madame Secretary"" is a also compelling. Here, he is perfect. His facial expressions, his strong physique, his dark hair and eyes (playing on 'tall, dark, and handsome'). He is introduced into the story almost like a myth: lone stranger appearing out of nowhere.The only weak link is Naomi Watts as Plain woman living the Plain life. Her occasional scrunchy facial expressions are, frankly, weird. But, overall, she does execute her role well. Her part in that powerful embrace matches Mr. Daly's perfectly! Awesome! Also, her prayer that turns into a declaration of love is also emotionally rich and complete!Basically, this is the story of the Big Bad Wolf coming into the lives of an isolated woman and son on the plains, trying to sheepherd. The wealthy big shot cattleman kills her husband and threatens her until the Wolf, no longer bad, but protective, helps her.""The Outsider"" is a revelation. One of Ms Watts's compelling speeches is her statement that all people can be redeemed and that this wounded stranger has a right to seek this forgiveness and resulting redemption. The moral element threads throughout the story, gracefully, not obnoxiously.I look forward to receiving my DVD so that my brother and I can once again share a favorite romantic movie, this time adding to our repertoire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6W3DL282BVKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000C2IR4#wasThisHelpful","R6W3DL282BVKN","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Do prophecies come true? Can a enclosed community really keep evil out? What if sin is already in the community through its highest authority? What then?Perhaps intent may be the strongest catalyst to bringing in evil. ""Devil's Hand,"" or Drommelkind, is the end result of the prophecy of six girls being born on the sixth day of the sixth month. One mother killed both her baby and herself to nix the prophecy. Didn't work, as the viewer learns. The remaining five girls live as close as sisters, then the day of their eighteenth birthday nears and terrible things begin to happen. Suicide (really?) and murders of the ""chosen"" girls and those near to them start occurring. The viewer sees a black-garbed figure with a scythe or sickle and the swinging blows and resultant blood. Those scenes are very technically and cleverly done to give maximum effect with minimum visceral offering.Is this figure one belonging to the Devil, come to help his Drommelkind? Or is the figure human, using the black of night and prophecy to yield blows against foretold evil? Or something else entirely?""Devil's Hand"" turns out to be an artistically told story, cinematically strong, carefully directed, even enthusiastically.

I expected a let's-make-a-movie mentality, but I was pleasantly pleased with this movie.It is worth much more than the $5 bin from which I obtained it, but then ""Skyfall"" was in that same bin.The film can be classified as horror or thriller, but also mainstream.

"The fair way to review ""Marie Antoinette, Serial Killer"" is to list the positive reasons for reading this off-the-chart fictional history. Katie Alender starts with a real historical person then adds a fictional Order of the Key, a club of six families at the time of Marie, who swore their allegiance to protect her and her children during the French Revolution. Despite being fictional, this order made for interesting reading. What the author did was use the order to point out actual historical events.The main reason for reading this novel is the exposure to current cultural aspects of Paris--and there are many. She describes food, smells, small family comraderie, museum trips, metro rides and how to figure them, archives, and, of course, money and language.Tucked into this fictional/real story is the ill treatment of friends by the haughty, rich girl who demands her way everywhere. There are three in this clique, however, the third girl begins with a modicum of decency and grows increasingly kind and thoughtful. So this aspect makes the book more likeable.The most fantastic (as in fantasy) is Marie Antoinette as a ghost serial killer. Yep, I do not lie. She whacks heads. Spoiler? No way. Look at the title of the book. It's real, except, of course, it's not.Overall, I would recommend this book to the middle school crowd (although there is a kissing scene).","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODKSTVYO3YFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545468108#wasThisHelpful","R1ODKSTVYO3YFF","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: Even though I will attempt to write around spoilers, one may leak into this review.""A Most Wanted Man"" is not the film I expected to see. Promotions touted it as a ""tense spy thriller with an unexpected ending."" It's that ending that is so bothersome. I fully expected Hoffman to work in counter-intelligence and be that pusher in the center of the ""unexpected."" Let's just say that the term counter-intelligence goes too far. Hoffman, indeed, goes too far, but (spoiler) not in the way one would think.Hoffman plays the head of a little spy agency based in Hamburg. While his acting may be intense here and there--but not that much. His acting was neither impressive prize worthy. In fact, his acting was ho-hum, how much am I getting paid for this role? type. Oh yes, there were two really big moments: both times when he lit a cigarette downwind. He had to bend over and stretch his body to prevent the wind from blowing out his light. Not a nail-biting moment.If I seem to be poking fun at Mr. Hoffman's acting, you must know that I respect his real acting, but this movie doesn't exemplify it. As for other actors, they lend credence to ""A Most Wanted Man"" as a serious thriller/spy film. Rachel McAdams deserves most praise as the illegal immigrant's attorney, while Willem Dafoe turns in a respectful performance as the banker in charge of the suspected terrorist's huge money supply. Terrorist, immigrant--that's the initial question for the little spy agency and the government of Germany at the beginning. Once the immigrant's identity has been established, focus turns on the Muslim cleric to whom he seeks to give money. The actor playing the Chechen immigrant shows little sign of his acting chops.The more powerful agencies give free rein to Hoffman's agency in locating the immigrant and following his movements. They also latch on to the attorney. By the end all hands are on deck, so to speak, and all truths are out. And it's not what the viewer has come to expect.The movie is watchable, but expect no awards, even if this was Hoffman's last full acting gig. There is no sense of urgency or thrill or even danger. The action just plods along, teasing that imminent danger is ahead, but when it comes, what? That was it?","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19J0FQKGKPZ9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LP7LU#wasThisHelpful","R19J0FQKGKPZ9X","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Detachment"" is the new film starring Adrian Brody, who is becoming large in my eyes for his keen acting ability. His own eyes reflect the detachment of the title and the great sorrow detachment brings. He is not part of us; he belongs elsewhere, but while he's here, let's cling fiercely to him for all he's worth or let's ignore him totally. This is the view of his students, the substitute who has come to these modern existentialists, those who are also detached. Those not are ignored in this film.Brody plays a permanent substitute teacher who moves from school to school, filling in for first one teacher then the next. His job mirrors his commitment-less life. One point he makes is that we all have secrets. His is seeing his pitiful mother naked and dead as a young boy. It's a story etched in his face and blast through his eyes. It helps him present depressing literature to a class full of pained and hurting teenagers. They sense his depths of pain and want to commit to him, drain his life, pulse it into their own veins of emptiness and loneliness and despair.A female colleague tells Brody's character that she is afraid of going home. Her soul is also devoid of emotion--it's just hollowness. She's Eliot's hollow man. She is all right in the classroom where she is engaged and engaging, yet all those hours alone at home are just too frightening to consider.Lucy Liu plays the counselor who abhors counseling because of the horror she encounters in these teens' abysmal lives. Finally, she tells one girl who has a dwarfish soul to get ""the f.... out of her office."" It's a powerful scene of one educator completely coming unglued and letting the knives out of the drawer.Marcia Gay Hardin is the stern, all-business principal who loses her job during the film. Her reaction to her second detachment is so pitiful that it will bring deep sorrow to the viewer. Apparently the director knows detachment himself to imbue, even drench his film with it.One iota of joy concludes this celluloidic adventure: the prostitute teen whom Brody's character befriends, well, the film is worth this last scene, this little iota of joy or something like joy.The film is presented much like a documentary on the  barren life of a teacher and the teens in his/her arena. There is much about the film that rings so true (spoken by a teacher of 40 years), and perhaps much that is exaggerated. The director pushes a heavy hand to draw attention to the utter despair that is our modern times in far too many lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MW6IBR0M1UHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086900TI#wasThisHelpful","R2MW6IBR0M1UHQ","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My siblings and I grew up playing games. When my sister found this Memory Game Birds of America, she bought and bestowed it as a gift to our brother's children. We've been playing this game for several years now. Each time is as much fun as the last.And what a memory booster! There must be 100 cards (I don't have the game in front of me) of 50 matching pairs of birds. When all the cards are turned face down, they fill the top of an extended dining table. The goal of the game is to win as many sets of matching birds as possible. The quality of the photos is sharp and bright, colorful and identifying. We love looking at the birds.So, the cards are face down. We go clockwise with the youngest player starting the game.The player turns up two cards, trying to find matching cards. The trick is to memorize the location of all turned up cards. My 14-year-old nephew and 16-year-old niece are the reigning champions, but the little one, the first grader going into second, has now equaled her brother in cards captured. I'm still the low man (the great aunt). If the player matches a pair, he/she gets another turn. No match, then next player takes a turn.The game is frustrating for those of us whose memory is not as sharp as it once was, but a fun experience in watching how well the little ones play. The grandfather turned it into a generational match when we finally convinced him to play. We play as individuals usually, one against one. Or boys vs girls.The best way to end the game is not to count the final captured cards. That way everyone has a positive experience.Another way to use the cards is to sit and study the pictures, alone or with another. Prepare for a match to come and, coincidentally, learn to identify birds.The only drawback to this set of cards is that there is no identifying information about the birds--just the photo and the name.

"The Black and Decker NST2118 12-inch cordless edger/trimmer is a superior product to its predecessor (mine just died of a long, active, productive life). My near-by super duper national discount house wasn't carrying edgers at this time of year (what? grass doesn't grow in the summer?!) Went online and, of course, found the B&D edger/trimmer on Amazon. Ordered the product and began using it the day it arrived. Love it! The removable battery lasts long enough to do either yard (front or back) at a time. Since I'm a little old lady, I mow only one at a time.I found two wonderful improvements over the previous B&D trimmer: the handle is adjustable (yay!) and the battery is removable for charging. The previous unit had to be plugged into a charging unit.I'm really giving four and one-half stars and discounting perhaps for something Black and Decker cannot help. The unit is a bit heavy for a little old lady's arm.I really like this unit and find it fun to use!Edited Note: After using this unit all summer, I am adding that half star into my evaluation. I had arthritis in my arm that supports the unit. Holding it caused pain, totally not the fault of the unit's weight. After the pain diminished, I zapped right through my yard without a problem. Therefore, I am giving Black and Decker its due point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DW4YOQIW1078/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004A84XI8#wasThisHelpful","R1DW4YOQIW1078","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are all kinds of words out there to use to describe ""Bad Words,"" but finding the right ones might be tricky. It might also be tricky to describe just what kind of movie this is. Sure, it's comedy and Jason Bateman is totally the right person for his role. It might be a social issue story about bad childhoods and tough luck adult lives. Or it might be a story about child neglect and abuse, but not totally. So, just what is ""Bad Words?""For one thing, Bateman, actor and director, is up front about content. There are plenty of ""bad words,"" many of which are said by the ten-year-old boy actor who is Bateman's main competitor in a prestigious national spelling bee. Also perfect is the boy's comic timing--it's incredible, or perhaps the director was on cue in his direction. When the boy is encouraged to use bad words, he blurts out with ""m-f"" so forthrightly that the viewer must wonder if he has used such words before.So what do bad words have to do with anything? Bateman's character meets all the requirements to participate in the contest, including never finishing the eighth grade. Lest you think he is not bright, the viewer learns that this character is a genius, which becomes quite evident during the spelling phase. The director of the bee, out of outrage that Bateman has bested all the adults in preventing him from participating, rigs the contest so that he gets all the 40-letter words, which, of course, he can spell.Bateman uses any unethical, tacky, downright immoral tactics to disqualify various contestants. Chaitanya spends his contest time in a hotel room alone. His dad wants him to be his own man. What? Alone? A ten-year-old? Bateman takes him out for recreation and fun, his version. Expect the unexpected. And it's all funny (I say under my breath because showing a ten-year-old a prostitute's huge breasts just does not seem right...).See? Words just cannot do this movie justice. It is so uniquely funny, even though repulsively so. After Bateman digs in under the viewer's skin, he becomes Everyman in a plot to get justice, no matter how. Comic bite and poignant justice are served equally well. I really appreciated both Bateman's intent and delivery of intent. The movie, I predict, will become a classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJMGGZNYLI7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH4SZWK#wasThisHelpful","R1MJMGGZNYLI7C","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago when Iran closed it borders and halted its sales to the devil America, I lost their precious henna. Natural vegetable dye is so much better than synthetic color; however, for a good second, L'Oreal's Feria Copper Shimmer, 74 is a wonderful way to get a great red! And I mean a really great red--not shy, not mild, but bold and out there. In fact, the product notes this: ""Feria's prismatic colour spectrum is custom-blended for bold, head-turning shades."" That says it all. No, one more thing: Copper Shimmer leaves hair silky and pleasant to touch and smell.I introduced my sister to Feria (we're all redheads in my family). She didn't like so much the intensity of Feria and moved on to a softer red created by another product. Not I! I love my Copper Shimmer! Now if only the color lasted longer than four or five weeks, but that's a problem with any hair product, thus not really a problem.After note: If only I knew that Feria is not tested on animals--I'm hoping not!

"I know I've seen better movies but not ones I love more. I love ""Dear John"" and all its riffs. When I was in the eighth grade, I read ""Gone With the Wind"" for the first time. Over the next few years I read it a total of five times, mainly seeking a different ending, but, of course, there isn't one. ""Frankly, I don't give a damn"" will always be that last retort. However, a different ending does occur in ""Dear John"" and I watch the movie just to see it again and again.Besides, the beautiful Channing Tatum and the gorgeous Amanda Seigfried make up the good-looking couple who bond almost immediately in the story. The way he touches her, the way she looks at him just seem so real (or I want it to be real). Tenderness, gentility, thoughtfulness braid through the story, revealing through both their characters.In three weeks the ""summer romance"" ends: she goes back to college, he returns to duty in the Middle East. Before they part, they decide to write of their lives in their letters, to continue to develop on paper what they cannot in flesh. Their words of choice in parting: ""See you soon then?""It's not an easy romance. One thing after the other interrupts this distance relationship, all good reasons, all understandable. Yet, still, everything is on hold. How long can such a love last? Additionally, John's father is autistic; Savannah's longtime neighbor male friend also has an autistic son. All play roles in this love story.Tears, tears, tears--after all, this is a Nicholas Sparks story. However, let me declare now, neither of the main characters dies. When the ending comes, it comes quietly, gently, and so understated. Perfect!  It's not a perfect love story, but it is most assuredly a worthy one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTF91DB6GZ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0021L8V3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2GTF91DB6GZ3H","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once in a while a rare film comes along that simply dazzles in its simplicity, its skewed characters, its interior life fomenting to be loosed. ""Labor Day"" is just such a film. I absolutely love this movie.When one considers life, one possibly thinks of Good winning, of normal people living out their lives. However, Jason Reitman considered those other people, those in need, those by-passed of happiness, of normalcy. These people live one day at a time--barely. Such is Kate Winslet's character, who suffers from depression, debilitating sadness, loss, and simply cannot get herself together. After so many mind-boggling miscarriages, her husband, a good man, cannot take any more and leaves, finds a new wife and starts a new life. Their son moves back and forth between his parents, although in this story, he is with his mother. He becomes the omniscient narrator who provides the viewer with back story and ongoing actions.Into their closed lives one day comes an intruder, a prison escapee. From the time he enters the story, I felt a bristling, an undercurrent, a sense of violence just waiting to explode. That's Josh Brolin, perfectly cast for this role. He reads immediately into the character of Adele, sensing that she is very lonely and troubled. He is gentle with her. Their growing attraction is beautifully drawn.But happiness in such doomed characters cannot last. Two new characters are introduced and it is through them that the love story is crushed. The viewer cannot help but weep for their loss. Life goes on. That incessant droning of inertia is re-instilled in both Frank's and Adele's lives. However, this is not a Nicholas Sparks story--no one dies. And the ending--the ending is magnificent! The viewer will weep here, too.My brother loves chick flick movies. I keep telling him this is a ""chick flick"" not to be missed, but he's not there--yet. When he is, he will thank me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CVL01LZ76XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9LHVHI#wasThisHelpful","R16CVL01LZ76XL","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I searched through Amazon's ""foreign language"" films to find something in French for my French students to experience, I found ""The Intouchables"" and decided to buy and try it, even though it contains strong language (lots of it), some drug use, and a mild hooker scene. Despite the negatives, students loved the film! As did I! (Note: The film is a French movie, but subtitles render it easy to follow.)It's a life-affirming story of people and activities. The African immigrant (as a young child) who is hired to be the personal assistant to Phillipe, a quadriplegic, totally dependent on others for his upkeep and even his life, is so winsome that it is almost impossible not to love this character. Driss comes to the interview to get a signature for unemployment, but, instead, is hired because he does not feel pity for the Frenchman or his circumstances. Driss even tells Phillipe in one scene that he won't give him some candy out of his bag. Why? ""No handy, no candy."" It is meant to be funny and it is. Driss badgers Phillipe into laughing at his own handicap.The only thing that can carry off this blatant humor is the actor himself, Omar Sy, who won the French equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Actor. In his humility, he told one reporter that both should have received the award. ""How can an award be split between two people when it took both people to make the story,"" he asked.There are so many wonderfully funny, poignant, and dramatic scenes throughout the movie. One of my faves is the scene in which he learns how large his bathroom is and that he has his own great big tub. He promptly seeks out Phillipe's secretary for whom Driss has a major attraction and asks her if she would like to take a bath with him. He is so serious. She is so rejecting.The ending is a great, warm delight. The range of emotions that passes over Phillipe's face (Francois Cluzet) is miraculous. ""The Intouchables"" is truly one of the great films. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5XP4HYEK6HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087IT8FK#wasThisHelpful","RN5XP4HYEK6HH","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times since my sister recommended it. It's one of those movies that one enjoys over and over again. Why? Here's my list of reasons why:1. The actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Both are immensely likeable whether or not you approve of their lives outside the movie house. However, I surmise, right or wrong, that they did not particularly like each other as themselves. If I'm right, that means their acting is quite convincing because they do have chemistry in this film.2. The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the movie. It is violent but not violent. So many bullets fly around Tom's character, yet he is not hit until the end (not giving anything away).3. The title is a play on words. The knight hides the battery (see the movie to understand the inference). The day that may or may not come.4. Very few curse words fly; in fact, each time I hear one I am reminded of how few there are.5. The comedy is delightful. I love every line each character has. My favorites: ""With me. Without me."" ""Someday means never. It never comes."" ""This is Someday, Roy."" Oh, yes, the words about undressing her. Ha ha. The best humor comes with the turn-about is fair play thing.6. Good guys win. I mean REALLY win, as in double winning with the special ending.7. Special ending, very unexpected, but totally right.I thank my sister for recommending this movie.

"""Olympus Has Fallen"" is definitely worth your time viewing--maybe even three times! The casting is excellent, the story is sufficiently believable, and the location is great.So, I'll start with location. Shreveport, LA has become a film mecca. This must be Gerard Butler's third or fourth film here, this one his co-production (or with several producers). Butler plays Mike Banning, a Secret Service man who loses the president's wife early in the story and is ostracized to the Treasury Department, not his fault, but because of bad memories. This position leaves Banning in a situation to save the day, so to speak. I've seen Butler in all his movies and think this is his second best role (after ""300""). His face is showing age, a good thing in this film because it makes him experienced. Anyway, when he walks down a street, I recognized my hometown's streets and trees. That makes for a fun movie, looking for local places.Many previous reviewers compared ""Olympus Has Fallen"" with the ""Die Hard"" series. I suppose the comparison can be made--the lone police official miked in to outside support and becoming an inevitable hero. Butler has a number of heroic, bold lines comparable to Willis's lines. Yeah, I must agree, the comparison is legit.Aaron Eckhert plays the president well enough, with good ol' Morgan Freeman as acting president. However, the most significant aspect of the film is the plot by a Korean terrorist group to take over the White House (Olympus has fallen). Since ads reveal all this, I have not. My vote for best actor of the film is Rick Yune, the Korean leader.My biggest problem with the movie is the love story between Banning and his wife. There was no spark there at all. I found it a bit disturbing. Apparently, this was a couple at their plodding point, so I'm not sure why it was included.If you're a Butler fan, a follower of political intrigue and evil plots, love a good action flick, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a wise use of your time and money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFHGPXIS3EEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYHO2#wasThisHelpful","R1LFHGPXIS3EEY","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Greeks believed that fate controlled us. Oedipus tried to escape his fate by taking certain actions, which, ironically, led him directly into the path of his ordained fate. My initial viewing led me to think fate was the controlling factor here, too. But not so. The characters try to change their fates, their futures and some are successful.Why the title? ""The Place Beyond the Pines""-- what's there that gives the film its title? A friend, a grounding, a source of history, some explanations, each an essential element of the story of Luke (Ryan Gosling, a superb actor), a daredevil carnival motorcycle rider, and his son Jason. The story covers about seventeen years in a hop-skip fashion and comes in three distinct acts: Luke the bank robber, Avery the police officer who changes Luke's future, and their two sons who intersect as teenagers.(One note at this point: Gosling always plays the dangerous bad boys, Cooper the wide-eyed heroic types. Wouldn't it be interesting to see a role reversal here? Can Gosling lose his edginess to play the solid, stand-up guy? Can Cooper disguise those innocent eyes to be edgy?)The film comes in three acts: Gosling as an irresponsible man, father, bank robber; Cooper as hero by quirk--or intention--of fate, momentary dirty cop, politician; and the intersection of their two sons 15 years later to move the fates forward.The most interesting point of the film is seeing how Avery Cross's son turns out--and it's not pretty. What the viewer learns in Act Two is that Cross (Cooper) cannot look at his son after Act One (I am deliberately avoiding revealing important information). So he grows up neglected--and wow, what an obnoxious, malicious young man he is. On the other hand, Luke's son is just a typical boy, product of a family that stayed together, although he knows nothing about his birth father.Just as Luke found himself a new mode in ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Jason (his son) learns about his father from the same source. It's a place like the fig tree: safe but full of danger. Luke partook of danger, Jason took a little knowledge.""A Place Beyond the Pines"" is definitely worth seeing, worth the money, but I want to ask more of the actors, the director. Do Cross and his son really change in Act Three. Do people in general really change? And Jason: Why doesn't he keep the photo? Does he divorce himself from his old life and head out into a new future, a new destiny? That photo initiates new potentiality. It's an abrupt but fascinating ending, one of those that make you create your own ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LZVM300AIR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYKM6#wasThisHelpful","R27LZVM300AIR3","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How wonderful it is to pick up a new book and find total delight in reading the first page, then settling in, allowing the imagination to discover the story, and finally the aha experience of consuming the book all the way to the last page.  So it was with ""A Teaspoon of Earth and Sea"" by Dina Nayeri. This is a book to savor, page by page, teaspoon by teaspoon, on earth and sea.The story is set in a tiny rice-farming village in northern Iran at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution. Yes, things were as awful in the book as depicted on television during the transition in the late '70's. What Americans know of Iran is what they see in protests on television: Death to America and all that. However, this novel shows the reader what people were like in everyday Iran--in those small villages. If asked the bottom line why I loved this book, my answer is this: Women accommodated themselves to a harsh regime through their very private, imaginative lives lived fully within that privacy. The read was rewarding in opening my mind to the average people of Iran, especially the women.The book is magical at best and imaginative at least. It has become one of my favorite books. The writing is often exquisite, the wisdom profound. Consider this: Life is lived small moments at a time and is filled with those small moments. Wondrous experiences are simply small moments in the Big Picture. Sex may be a wonderful thing, but in context, it's just a small moment. One moment became volcanic for Saba Hafezi at age eleven. Her mother, a woman impossible to contain, and Saba's twin sister, Mahtab, leave for America, escaping the mullah Iran just erupting. That event looms over Saba for years. Because she does not know for sure what happened to her twin, her other, or her mother, she makes up stories to explain Mahtab's life in America. The book is filled with Saba's inventive stories of her sister's mystery unveiled.Making stories is what the imaginative women of Iran do in the privacy of their homes. They are the myth-makers, but they must recite a verse at the end of the story to let the listener know if the story is truth or fiction. The novel is filled with those stories. In fact, the novel is filled with intriguing characters, both male and female, both just and unjust. The main characters are Saba, her two best childhood friends who transition into adulthood. It's a threesome: two girls and a boy with a probing jealousy between the two girls. Ponneh is a great beauty and Reza is their handsome friend. Who marries whom and why? What events must transpire to allow Saba the freedom she seeks? What horrors must she endure?Although the writing is wondrous at times, it is dense, and the story slogs and becomes repetitive from time to time, but this reader never lost interest.  In addition to the writing, what I most enjoyed about the novel is the unfolding of truths about Iran that were surprising to me. In fact, the novel itself was the story-making macrocosm of Iran and its people. The novel is well worth the time invested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3788615I7GCKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487049#wasThisHelpful","R3788615I7GCKE","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry, kids, but the first thing that comes to mind in reviewing ""Bullet to the Head"" is how Stallone is aging and doing it well. My boomingness takes note of such things: skin is a bit crepy but muscles are fine-tuned, taunt, and distinct. No sag there! Since my gen is still making action movies (may I point out that Mick just turned 70?), I cannot avoid looking for and at the age factor.That said, ""Bullet to the Head"" is valid use of two hours. The most amazing scene is the axe fight. What? Stallone with an axe? The old man simply is not old. He fights the good fight and in this case, gets a little help.But I always get ahead of myself. Stallone plays a hit man, one world-weary, yet confident, strong, yet paired with a partner. And there presents the rub. The partner is offed during a double-cross and by a dirty, underhanded series of stabbings with a relentless blade. Being a man of loyalty, Jimmy Bobo (Stallone) must avenge his partner's death.A new pairing results. A New York detective goes to New Orleans to investigate the death of one of their own, a dirty cop. Why did he become corrupt and for whom? The uneasy pairing was not inspiring or logical. A cop bound to the letter of the law working with a hit man? It did not work for me. Nor did the particular actor, Sung Kang. (The pairing of Kathryn Heigel and Seth Rogan worked about as well.)After Stallone, the most effective actor is Jason Momoa as the assassin on the opposing side. Unlike Bobo, who kills for money, Momoa's characters kills for enjoyment. He's Dexter on steroids. Christian Slater plays a corrupt character with his usual breathy elegance. When the New York detective says he will make Slater talk by using psychology on him, Bobo proves the threat of torture will produce results in spades! It's a great, ironic scene!And no one is indispensable except Bobo, the detective, and Bobo's daughter. I expected tough girl stuff from her character, but was disappointed. She's just a girly girl covered in tats. However, for the ""bad guys,"" in a dark world of corruption and deal making, one's place in the universe is never secure.My biggest complaint (and a mild one) is that the New Orleans setting was not used to advantage. It was a prop, a city of corruption, a city just ripe ""for the taking."" Yuk!Overall, the movie held my attention. I was entertained. Did I learn anything new? Hmmm. If one is a hit man, be prepared to eliminate your living quarters if threatened by the enemy. But I already knew that from a Jason Statham movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQK790WEIC4Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9EJS2#wasThisHelpful","RQK790WEIC4Z5","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's the 1800's. Napoleon and Josephine are on the throne in France, but that's a familiar story. Let's travel to the Ottoman Empire a few thousand miles to the east. It's Istanbul, or Constantinople, on the Bosphorous River. Nightly, a man is drowned in the river for his intimacies with Esma Sultan, beloved sister of Sultan Mahmud II, all-powerful leader of the empire. He decrees than any man who sleeps with his sister must die, thus the blood of the innocent in the river. The main character of the book's title is ""the Drowning Guard,' a giant of a man selected by the sultan to perform the drowning.This selection is a punishment. Ivan Postivich is a Serbo-Croatian, stolen from his country as a child to become a horseman in the sultan's empire. That's how the sultan obtained his armies, his guards: He rounded them up as children, squashed the Christian out of them, and drilled the Koran and Muslim beliefs and ideals into them (as best he could). Ivan was renamed Ahmed Kadir and became a celebrated and legendary horseman, enough to threaten the sultan's self-confidence. He had him removed from the horseman ranks and demoted to a guard to serve his sister.Thus Esma and Ivan meet. Their story is bold and twisted, drawing upon both Christian and Muslim influences, both Christian and Muslim characters. Esma is like no other woman of her time or position. She holds a harem with protection for her women and rights beyond the face veils, even blatant freedoms. Mahmud works around her powers and causes mayhem and annihilation of the Janissary corps from which Ivan sprang.Esma develops spiritual despair from the many men whose deaths she has caused. She requires Ivan to become her confessor of sorts. As he hears her stories, he finds himself becoming deeply attracted to this most puzzling woman. The story becomes a page turner like stories of other star-crossed participants.At the end the reader discovers that most of the story is true, most of the characters actually lived. Fiction is woven into this history to become a most welcome historical fiction of first rate dimensions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSFF5DNGGHQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147780529X#wasThisHelpful","R2GSFF5DNGGHQF","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my ""Easy Go Multipurpose Cart."" I don't remember where I bought it and have never seen one again--until today. I sell crafts at our local Farmers Market. People use all manner of toting products, but one woman was pulling this Easy-Go cart for the produce and other buyables to take home. I stopped her, we chatted about this great product. She has, in fact, three of them. Now that I know where I can find the cart, I may end up with three also.I use my single one to hold my garden tools, seeds, water can, and whatever else I need to haul around. The cart makes gardening so easy (or easy in this way anyway). Recently, I watched my neighbor make three loads to take her yard things from the yard back into her little tool room. I make ONE trip.As for use of the cart: The picture shows a little rectangular hole at top. That's the handle for pulling the cart. The big barrel has plenty of space to hold all my small gardening tools, seed packets, fertilizer, a water jug, a whisk broom and pan (for leaves), yard bags, ties, and whatever else I may need to drop in. As for color--mine is industrial green. That lovely blue is enticing---","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8E3QFGQ0P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACNSN2M#wasThisHelpful","RF8E3QFGQ0P5","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a city in which many of the downtown streets are named after Alamo heroes: Travis, Crockett, Milam, and Texas, our main street. Note: just as in history, Houston was not there or here. I digress only to say I grew up with names of Alamo heroes  frequently spoken, like mantras to remember long-ago heroes.My sister and I visited the Alamo just a year ago and stood in many of the spots where blood was spilled and legends made. So it was only natural that I watch this movie when it recently played on a movie channel. John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" is not John Wayne's version. The older version was made during the years following World War II, when inspiring myth-making was in full ascent.This recent version is much grittier and more likely, although several reviewers gorgeously described the film as also modern myth making. I think, though, that Crockett's last filmic words were actually spoken, as I remember hearing them before, probably by one of the Alamo specialists at the time of our tour. ""Here's your last chance to surrender. Turn in your arms and I promise no harm will come to you"" are words out of Crockett's mouth to the huge crowd of surrounding Mexican soldiers. Note: Crockett was bound and on his knees. Another reviewer attributed Crockett's words to the journal of one of the Mexican leaders, with the knowledge that leaders keep these records of their (hopefully) heroic and historic deeds.Billie Bob Thornton, of all actors, plays Crockett and does so with low- and high-keyed perfection. In fact, the most memorable scene of the film occurs during the evening when the Mexican band would play its prelude to cannon firing. Crockett takes his fiddle on the upper level of the fort in full view of the Mexican soldiers and, during their playing of the battle prelude, plays his own haunting melody, creating a Texian version of meaning (the movie uses ""Texian"" rather than Texan). It's a moment to savor.Other notable actors include Patrick Wilson (a long-time favorite of mine after seeing him in ""Phantom of the Opera""). Travis seeks to be elected leader of the Alamo fighters, but meets opposition from some of his own men. He is notorious because he abandoned his wife and children, for visiting prostitutes, and gambling. Toward the end, when a dying Bowie (played carefully by Jason Patric), asks Travis for a dying drink, Travis responds--with tongue in cheek: ""I visit prostitutes, gamble, abandon children, but I draw the line at alcohol.""(As an historical side note: There is a museum/gift shop located next door to the Alamo. On display are several versions of Jim Bowie's designs for the Bowie knife. And let me tell you--that design is incredibly horrific!!!)The film itself is simply awesome, the story vividly retold on cellluloid for posterity. I plan to purchase the film, this version, for my own record of one of America's most important battles. ""Remember the Alamo"" is a slogan to denote the brutal slaughter of every single Texan fighter and became a battle cry for all ages and all times, its symbolic significance deeply ingrained in our national subconscious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KX7J7Y4TH8DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QSLY12#wasThisHelpful","R1KX7J7Y4TH8DX","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Barbra Streisand, always have, yet ""Guilt Trip"" is not worth having her come out of retirement to waste her time. Actually, I cannot believe she did! I didn't like Seth Rogan in ""Knocked Up"" with lovely Kathryn Heigel and even less in this flop. He does not have good screen presence. Even less attractive men like Steve Buscemi can have great on-screen presence, but Mr. Rogan simply does not. Nor does he even vaguely resemble Streisand to pass as her son.And I'm just beginning my objections to this celluloid mess, which could have been better with script tweaking, nah, script rewriting. Some scenes had me think, aha, a passibly good one, then it isn't. An example is the silly free meal if you eat a 50-ounce steak. No, not Rogan, it's Streisand. The little flirtation that developes in this scene just did not make sense in that context.The only time I like Rogan occurs in the scene in which he finally, finally tells his mom to shut up! Streisand's character talks incessantly, INCESSANTLY! Even I was telling her to just shut it! Of course, her feelings are hurt. They always are when annoying people are finally told how annoying they are. It's this scene and all the preceding ones that make me curious why Streisand would take this role.OK, bottom line: The movie is about a man who has invented a tremendous product but has a poor sales technique. He invites his mom to take a cross-country road trip with him as he tries to sell his product. She is unaware that he is a failure because she is yakking all the time, telling him how great he is, how successful, how wonderful, blah, blah. She knows he tired of her and went to college across country to get away from her and now only sees her once or twice a year. Thus, the raison d'etre for the road trip--guilt.It's hard to read Rogan's face, except for ticks and twists and blips. He's not a convincing actor. And poor Streisand has had so much plastic surgery, her face is shrunken. She looks weird (although, I must add, she does not have a wrinkle on her face and she must be 70 at least!).There are two nice scenes toward the end which could have saved the movie, but they are wasted. They just do not have the power to erase the bad taste the previous hour gives. It's like licking an ice cream cone then the ice cream falls out. It's a tease, then it's disappointing.I wish I could give one good reason to see this movie, but, alas, I cannot.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVU84T59IJOF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMT9SQA#wasThisHelpful","RVU84T59IJOF9","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you review a Quentin Tarantino film, you must grant him leeway on some things, otherwise, a false rating would have to be given. ""Django Unchanined"" is a brilliant and excellent film with one minor glitch: all those explosive eruptions in human bodies from single bullets. So grant is given.Some reviewers refer to this film as a Western revenge film. I call it Magic Realism, a genre which would explain the immediate evolution of Django's gunslinging skills, his vocabulary explosion, and a new-found confidence in speaking educated English (or American). The most blantant exhibit of Django's evolution from lowly slave to freeman to confident bounty-hunter to bold Black Man, finally to Super Hero is through costuming and precisely through what Django selects as each juncture of his rise. The froppery of the blue costume indicates the inexperience in selecting what should represent the subtle quality of a free man. Finally, the leather vest and the weathered look of a cowboy depict a man who has arrived: not a black man, but a full man, a man who is not only free himself, but free to free others, to be a Super Hero.Magic Realism is a South American creation in taking sordid facts of history and incorporating totally unrealistic things to make the history more tolerable. In the South the first slaves who disappeared in stories through the magic of simply flying away while actually traveling through the Underground Railroad were probably the first indications of this magic in this realistic setting. Tarantino rescues a lowly slave into freedom via the moneyed hands of a German immigrant, untainted by the strictures of slavery as Southerners knew and experienced it. Thus, even slaves themselves adhered to that set of rules, most notably through the character of Stephen, played by Samuel L. Jackson. There could not be a more obsequious slave than Stephen. However, in private Stephen actually becomes his white master's confident confidant. It's a shuck, thus a bit of magic realism.When Django (Jamie Foxx) becomes this amazing gunslinger in the most rapid sleight of hand, Tarantino is playing with magic realism. Does the viewer allow this ""willing suspension of disbelief?"" Since it's Tarantino, it should be a given (except for the exploding flesh). It was also fascinating to watch Foxx transform from an uneducated slave into the Super Hero he finally becomes--watch for the suggestion of Roy Rogers at the end (or so I thought).Homage to other films is another of Tarantino's trademarks. The most obvious was the slowing running word MISSISSIPPI across the screen when the doctor and Django arrived in the hotbed of racism, Mississippi. The huge letters paid homage to ""Mississippi Burning,"" a film with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, a film saturated with murder and mayhem to this film in which murder and mayhem are soon to happen but in reverse.In the Mississippi setting in a plantation named Candyland, after the Candie family, comes the despicable Col. Candie, played with aplomb and relish by Leonardo DeCaprio. Oh my gosh, but he was good--uh, bad, and so convincing.I would be remiss if I did not mention Christoph Waltz, so deserving of his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Tarantino's weaving of this German character into a Southern setting, especially naming his black female slave after a German mythological character, was simply brilliant. How he puts these two characters together is the focal point for Django's later heroic rescue. Of course, Tarantino manipulated the plot, but so cleverly!""Django Unchained"" is the story of a classic hero quest: Django is the hero, the doctor is the Wise Old Man, both having various obstacles to overcome, a villain in Col. Candie, and the damsel who must be rescued. I always thought the Star Wars story was a perfect quest theme, but ""Django Unchained"" has become a modern, although historic, mode for the quest theme. This film is brilliant!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZ4TJNCLZ1DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIJY#wasThisHelpful","RFZ4TJNCLZ1DT","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps because I am a Christian with the same values as depicted in the film, perhaps because I recognize the truths the film shows, perhaps because I am an avid movie buff. For whatever ""because,"" for whatever reason, I find ""Courageous"" one of the most perfect films ever created. Every character rings true, every piece of dialogue, every scene, every setting, every part and parcel of action and plot ring true. ""Courageous"" is an awesome and amazing film filled with great emotional, moral, ethical moments buttressed by clips of exciting action scenes. It's a film worthy of viewing multiple times.""Courageous"" depicts the daily lives of four police officers and their Latino friend, Javier. The main character is played by the co-writer/director/producer, Adam Kendrick, whose finger is on the very mainline pulse of the America that once existed--a moral America. The film promotes many positive things, foremost being a good father, a father as set forth in the Bible. In fact, the ultimate premise for this promotion lies in statistics: Families without fathers tend toward serious delinquency problems. There's a void in the child's heart that needs to be filled, if not with a good father image, then with gang leaders. Even fathers who are a part of the family direct their children away from them if they are present but unavailable.The event that precipitates this resolution to be a true father is the death of the main character's precious daughter. Be prepared to be deeply moved by this well-written section. Some scripts try to jerk the viewer emotionally, but not this one. Everything is so evenly played and handled. No maudlin moments, no flaunting of emotional excess.Each of the male characters was (carefully, not blatantly) created to represent a specific type of man/father. Adam's character is the founder and spokesperson for the group that resolves to be biblically-based fathers. Nathan is the fine, upstanding black officer, proud of his accomplishments but who came out of a fatherless home and severely felt the loss. One character is the single man (young, white) who has fathered a child and not taken responsibility for her. The last is the one who yields to temptation and breaks the bond that hold the men together. The fifth is a Latino, a devout Catholic, a family man who is having terrible problems with keeping a job, not through his own fault. How he becomes a member of this little group is part of a hilarious, yet touching scene.Family complications and eventual growth also make this film inspirational. So, bottom line: inspiration of several kinds, integrity, loyalty, honest and decent work, friendship, and commitment to true religious values all contribute to making this a film worthy of purchase to make multiple viewings possible. I absolutely loved ""Courageous"" and all it stands for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R398NIUOUNE8KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062NAX1U#wasThisHelpful","R398NIUOUNE8KU","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Flight"" is about Denzel Washington, the actor who has taken chances, proved himself worthy, and now accepts all kinds of roles. Playing an alcoholic and becoming that person convincingly highlights once again Denzel's exceptional talent. I've always been a fan.That said, I must include in my positive things these negatives:1. I don't like it one bit that he is showing signs of aging. He can't help it, none of us can, but I want to remember him as that beautiful man he was when he was young. I am being totally unreasonable, but there it is.2. My biggest objection is also questionable. In my memory Denzel has never had a relationship onscreen with a white woman. He does this time. She is also half his age, but then again, her race and age are irrelevant to the arrogant, obnoxious dude he plays. Being a player is part of who he is only as it reflects his addictions to both drugs and alcohol. In a movie from his younger years he plays a sheriff in Haiti who has a brief affair with a white woman. The test audience, or the black women in that audience, were incensed and the film maker changed that part of the film to a black woman. I think, here in this film, he had to break with his tradition because that is what his character would have done. So, I guess I say kudos now.3. I did not realize the film was about addiction. Not my favorite subject. A personal dislike. Also unfair to the film.What I did like about the film:1. Denzel's acting. He is completely convincing as an addict. Completely.2. The addiction is dealt with in a fair way.3. Two lines are memorable and will be repeated as such: He tells his paramour: ""I chose to drink. I chose to drink"" even in face of losing each person in turn in his life. Bravado, false. Braggadocio, false. But still a line memorably shouted. The second line almost makes hair stand up on one's arms: ""Who are you?"" To give it in context would be a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.This is a review about Denzel, my man. Others have written excellent reviews about theme and events. I'll stick with Denzel because he does redemption like no other.Oh yes, the title. It's obvious: a flight goes down. However, the pilot, loaded on drugs and alcohol, miraculously lands it. He's a hero, but not a hero. What takes flight is the symbolism behind the title. Flight. Flying. Freedom. Yeah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHE8OWR4XD41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFEXRME#wasThisHelpful","R2YHE8OWR4XD41","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Killer Joe."" What is this film: Violence porn? Image porn? Pointless? Visual prurience? Dark unto indecency? Oh yeah, all this and more! Except pointless. ""Killer Joe"" has very serious messages, but not for any of its characters. All of these characters, except perhaps the girl, are lost (the viewer learns at the end just how lost), but the girl is redeemable, perhaps.But as usual, I get ahead of myself. Matthew McConaughey is Killer Joe, a cop by day, a killer, an assassin by night, that is, for a high cost. In this case paying his price is dependent upon killing a woman for her life insurance earmarked for her 12-year-old daughter (yes, she looks much older and surely has the luscious body of a mature woman, but she plays 12). Joe demands a retainer and demands the girl. McConaughey's sexual encounter with this child-woman is a piece of prurient perversion gone amuck. Shocking? That's too weak. Unconscionable for sure. Sick, indeed, but the scene is very necessary in delineating Joe's character. He is not just a cold-hearted, brutal killer--he is a whacked-out sick-o, deserving of absolutely no sympathy. The viewer will never look at McConaughey the same way again. He's not just a pretty face--he's a talent now with nothing left to prove. He can do comedy. He can do romance. He can do serious. Now he can do evil.  Denzel Washington did it, too.Thomas Hayden Church is the biological father of two children with his ex-wife, now married to another man. There's a generous life insurance policy assigned to her daughter. It's a complicated, twisted plot about the whys and wherefores of the intended plan to kill the woman. Joe carries it off with inhuman indifference.Then the twist is revealed and an already ugly situation turns gruesome and shockingly violent. One scene involves a chicken leg and the plumped lips of a very attractive Gina Gerson. From this point on, many reviewers were reviled by the apparently meaningless violence and resulting bloodbath. But I disagree. I think Director William Friedkin had a very serious message. Whether my take on the movie corresponds with his is irrelevant. It's how I see what the director has given me. I put my own stamp on this creative process with my interpretation.Here it is: As an English teacher I taught ""Lord of the Flies"" every year to high school seniors. I've always thought this novel essential to any curriculum and a good education. It teaches moral lessons, social bonding both good and bad, the infiltration of evil and its overpowering attraction and its subtle and blatant take over and extinguishing of all moral ambiguity. By novel's end morality is being burned and evil is rampant and all-consuming. I used to ask those seniors: Tell me. What happens when these boys go home? What will they become? What will they do? Or, now, I might ask: Who are you-- to each boy survivor (a new lesson gained from ""Flight"" with Denzel in a new acting situation. After you've played a rabidly corrupt cop, you might get any kind of role as Denzel does here). Who are you, indeed.The key scene in ""Lord of the Flies"" occurs at the edge of the beach when one of the little ones is sitting and playing with a crab. It's called play, but it's a control issue on the verge of death of the crab. One of the older boys is casually throwing stones around the boy, never hitting him, but wanting to. Mores dictate that we don't throw stones and especially not to hit. But the thought is there. He intentionally does not--yet. On the other hand the boy will possibly kill the crab by happenstance, or not.The characters, all of them, except perhaps the girl, have taken that step beyond missing long, long ago. The first time opens the door. Isn't there nearly always a second? Well, I've done it once, blah, blah. Until there's a blood bath. Clearly, the director is making his message visibly potent: evil is a dark path leading to despair, pain, and possibly annihilation. Is this where you are heading? Who are you?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQAAW88JKSWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009POCG0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQAAW88JKSWH","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spoiler alert: a couple of scenes as a warning of film contentBe forewarned: ""The Paperboy"" is not an easy film to watch. However, each actor turns in surprisingly riveting  performances as the flawed characters they portray, making the film both gruesome and rewarding.It seems that Matthew McConaughey has something to prove after being named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine a few years ago. He apparently wants to burst his iconic pretty boy image which he surely does in this film. I declare, he has one of the most repulsive scenes in film history (my opinion) during and after a homosexual encounter. It's an image not soon forgotten and to his utmost credit that he would film it. His entire performance is riveting. (He also plays another image-buster in ""Killer Joe,"" another truly horrific movie.)The most shocking acting is by John Cusack, a usually mild-mannered actor. Not here. No sirreee. I had to read the credits to learn the actor's name. John Cusack? No way, but, yes, he is outstanding as a brutal, sex-crazed sociopath. The object of his ""passion"" is Nicole Kidman, who, once again, shocks with the habitation of the role she plays. Kidman disappears into the role of this woman weary of broken relationships and seeking love from a prison inmate. He takes her to the swamp and all its symbolic meanings.It is McConaughey's role as reporter to gather evidence to get Cusack's character freed. The problem is, well, you can guess it in a world gone seriously awry. This unwarranted freedom sets into motion some very irreversible and evil consequences. Themes abound.Perhaps the most surprising performance of all is from Zac Efron. Little Zackie is now a man and a reputable actor in a very dark story of human nature at its worst and its best in struggling to find love in that doomed world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CUMWF0MUH38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B47NCX0#wasThisHelpful","R8CUMWF0MUH38","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What the current and not-so-current crop of books and movies tells us is that the world is unpredictable, unreliable, and downright scary. Girls cannot travel in Europe without fear of being abducted as sex slaves. They cannot live down the road from a house where parents were murdered. Boys are born sociopaths and trick their silly, gullible fathers into buying them bows and arrows. That's the fiction. The truth is worse: multiple firing guns and anesthesia and abuse.Eric Poole, the 15-year-old killer of his parents, also claims abuse as his excuse--which no one believes. However, one little flashback near novel's end tells the reader that Eric, indeed, was abused and in the worst way. ""Tenderness"" by Richard Cormier, always a controversial and very edgy writer, shows the result of this particular abuse in this particular case.Teen sociopaths? Teen killers? We don't even blink an eye at such a story because we know it is true. What is so remarkable about this particular story (even though fiction) is that Cormier is so subtle with his clue. I missed it at first reading. Several pages later, I halted. Wait a minute, I thought, and flipped back to that paragraph. Sure enough, there was the truth, plain and simple or complicated in this case, and suddenly, things made sense.That's what is great about fiction: we get truths. In this case, truth explains why Eric is so emotionally warped and psychologically damaged. Why did Cormier write such chilling, provocative stories if not to cause discussion and, in a perfect world, initiate change.The other major character is Lori Cranston, who is abused through neglect, and therefore emotionally needy. She forms obsessions for certain people. With Eric her obsession is formed after a brief meeting (just after he kills one of his female victims during a ""tender"" moment). Lori seeks tenderness, too, to counteract the pain and void of neglect. Eric defends her when a gang threatens her, thus creating a need for tenderness from this boy.He kills his parents (the book cover tells the reader that) and spends three years in juvie detention, then is let go when he turns eighteen. The detective who arrested Eric watches him closely, knowing full well that Eric will kill again. Through odd circumstances the Eric and Lori run away together. The information she reveals about that long ago meeting makes Eric decide that he must kill her, yet he forms an surprising attachment to her. Threads of the story are woven together for an expected and totally unexpected ending.""Tenderness"" is a book to (oddly enough) savor for its fine writing and to be repelled by the horror. Like scotch or raw oysters, Cormier's talent is an acquired taste. His books definitely will never bore and are great to put into hands of reluctant teens who can handle mature themes.Cormier writes for Grade 6 (mature readers) and above. Other Cormier books, which I highly recommend, are ""The Chocolate War"" (his most famous), ""We All Fall Down,"" and ""I Am the Cheese.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOIDZ2GXEJLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385731337#wasThisHelpful","R2DOIDZ2GXEJLR","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, how James Bond has changed over the years from the suave and debonair Sean Connery to the unflappability of Roger Moore to the poignant subtlety of Pierce Brosnan to the quantum of solace exhibited by my very favorite of the Bond actors--Daniel Craig. His Bond is absolutely fearless--and we find out why in ""Skyfall,"" the latest in the wildly successful Bond series of hit movies!Skyfall--such an intriguing title, but what does it mean? Little Chicken shrieking about a falling sky but done metaphorically, of course? That's a good assumption, but not it. When the word, Skyfall, does appear on screen, it comes as a revelation. Skyfall, I actually said aloud. Skyfall. Of course.But I get ahead of myself. The opening scene defies the meaning of the word danger in movie history. How is it possible for two men to fight and jump and fall in such a location as the rooftops of the cars in a speeding train? But they do, only to see Bond fall into the opening movie credits and what I consider the best of the Bond title songs, which is co-created and sung by Adelle.The villain this time is Javier Bardem, an actor so talented that he can equally be convincing as horrific villains and an impossibly romantic lead (""Pray, Eat, Love""). He's a British agent, too, or was until the huge charge of power becomes a siren he cannot resist. More potent than power is vengeance and rightly so, in this case. He becomes corrupt and powerful and very destructive and vengeful, one of the most ominously dangerous of England's enemies in the Bond series.The show-down between Bond and Bardem has many flaws, but that's OK, it's a movie and those flaws can be ignored and forgiven. However, the big news is that three new actors are introduced into the story line, each taking the place of important character fixtures. The viewer will say, Oh my, with each new revelation and yet be pleased at how each is introduced. Yeah, I'm being vague--don't want to give any spoilers.So, that's my review. I'm skipping plot details because others before me beautifully presented those. My point is to highlight the changes and emphasize Daniel Craig as THE new Bond (yes, this is his third film as Bond, but this film establishes Craig as enduring and absolute).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SQZO8KD9V33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007REV4YI#wasThisHelpful","R6SQZO8KD9V33","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I most like about Amazon is this freedom to write reviews. Disagreeing with previous reviewers is sometimes a key factor in that enjoyment. Unlike many before me, I LOVE ""Taken 2"" with Liam Neeson and found it superior to its predecessor, ""Taken.""My 13-year-old great-nephew also loved the movie--so mark two for ""Taken 2"" for its multi-generational approvals. There's a slow beginning--too slow for my nephew until the action begins, then pow! the rest of the movie. Nonstop action! After the movie, my nephew said the slow beginning was necessary to set up the story that follows. Although he is a sophisticated movie buff, almost anyone would get it that the slow beginning is necessary.This time out, Neeson's daughter is car driving age--there's a big deal about not passing her driving test--a fact that becomes null and void by movie's end. In ""Taken"" Neeson kills the son of an Albanian mobster. Some kind of blood feud goes on in Albania much like the American Hatfield-McCoy feud. Neeson spilled Albanian blood, now the Albanian mob must spill Neeson and family blood.The goons kidnap Neeson and his wife, the daughter escapes. One of the most unusual chase scenes in movie history takes place on the colorful rooftops of ancient buildings in Istanbul, Turkey. It is wild!In the first ""Taken"" the daughter is kidnapped and sold as a sex slave. In this movie she becomes the hero. Movie history is changing. She also is part of a thrilling car chase, providing her with a set of certain skills in driving.The movie is worth watching just to hear Neeson say he has a set of certain skills he will use after he escapes his own imprisonment. ""I will find you"" is his omninous, now iconic statement much like Eastwood and Schwarzennegger use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DFQWIWNXLB4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067EKYAY#wasThisHelpful","R3DFQWIWNXLB4I","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last movie I reviewed (""Hit and Run"") got a slam. A reader/reviewer informed me that it was a movie for the below 50+ crowd and I was obviously not part of it. What's ""The Expendables 2"" then? I would expect it was also created for the machismo, teen boy crowd--like, wow, man, shoot that sucka!!! Only this time--and for all movies like this--I'm in! In fact, I'm in big time!But then again, this old broad is the same age as the machismo dudes with the duality of muscles and wrinkled skin wrapped around them! Sylvester Stallone, that heartthrob of the '70's and '80's, is the leader of a band of misfit former soldiers, now a tightly knit band of mercenaries for extracting good guys and executing bad guys.Many scenes are absolutely unbelievable--in fact, so much so, that the viewer just goes along for the ride. The most blatant is the pop-up appearance of Chuck Norris in the the most incredibly isolated area. Yet, there he is eradicating the piled up forces of evil and freeing our dudes.The most fun part of the movie for me is the inclusion of Jason Statham as second man to Stallone. I have never seen Jason play second to anyone, but this was fun to see him in a secondary spot. Gives him new dimension.Someone nearly always dies in a movie like this. I was not happy with the choice, but this man's death moved the action along in a new direction and tidied up disrupted emotional energies.I loved this movie despite its preposterous action scenes. I loved the one-liners and the comraderie. ""Expendables 2"" is a most worthy escapist fare of the best kind (for those who love their action thrillers)!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBEUDXERGS45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MF5BXK#wasThisHelpful","R1YBEUDXERGS45","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was afraid to locate the review page for ""Hit and Run"" with Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell. I did not like this movie--its characters, its premise, or its outcome. And I knew I would come here and discover that others did like the movie.The only reason I ""rented"" the thing is Bradley Cooper, whose talent is wasted here. Even if I had looked up reviews beforehand, I would have gotten all these four-star reviews, giving me a false positive. OK, here's what I didn't like:1. Shepard's unkempt, straggly hair2. Bell's character has a PHD, yet she is dressed in jeans for a serious job interview3. Tom Arnold plays a marshal, inept in every way. Tom, stop playing these demeaning roles. You actually have talent.4. Contains a silly app which helps find a gay partner5. Silly, immature plotWhat's to like then?

"I love it when a writer takes an old story and builds a new one out of it. That's what Grace Maccarone does in Peter Rabbit's Happy Easter.How does one improve a Beatrix Potter story? Not improve, but extend. Here's what she did: The story opens with Peter Rabbit, minus his blue jacket, sitting in an armchair, trying to figure out why his three sisters never get into trouble and he does with ease!Well, today is another day. His sisters can set the table and help their mother in the kitchen, but Peter will take a walk. Oh, here's Mrs. Jones' hen house. Just look at all those extra eggs, so he takes a few. The hens are squawking like crazy. Another hen house, more eggs. And one more and more eggs.Oh, Mother will be so pleased with me he thought, when she sees all these eggs I brought home. He stacks them next to some open paint jars. Oops! The jars tilt over and spill their contents over the eggs and--voila! Brightly colored eggs (just use your imagination here).No, Mother is not pleased and must once again fuss at her wayward son, then require that he return all the eggs. He does so, but pitches them willy-nilly in the bushes and bins. The next morning, which happens to be Easter, the children of the hen house owners find the eggs and are, of course, thrilled. Easter eggs!Would you believe that's how Easter eggs came about? The story is far-fetched, but so is a story about a little rabbit who loses his blue jacket. In both cases the lovely art work and clever story (with morals) make the books so beloved in the first case and fun in the second. Even my kindergarten students knew the story was meant to be fun! Personally, I like this story as much as the Potter original!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNM4XOOE7CF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439791391#wasThisHelpful","R3SNM4XOOE7CF0","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, do you know Peter Rabbit? Does your child? Yesterday I read this story to our kindergarten students. I'm the librarian. I discovered that half didn't know our little Peter. Now they do--and they identify with his trials and tribulations.In the beginning we learn that Peter feels dismay because he always gets into trouble and his three sisters are just saints! Now how is that possible? You know he must think that. Anyway, he has a new blue jacket about which his mother asks him to take particular care. He is admonished NOT to go near Mr. McGregor's garden. She goes shopping and leaves them on their own.Yes, Peter finds himself at the garden! How did that happen? And--that ol' McGregor sees him and shouts him away. Poor Peter falls into a net and escapes only by peeling out of his new blue jacket. Oh, goodbye new jacket! Then he hides in a garden can of cold water. Oh dear, poor Peter! Finally, he escapes and scurries home where his mother puts him to bed with a draught of bitter medicine. Meanwhile, his goody-two-shoe sisters get blackberries and cream for supper, a mighty tasty meal for little rabbits. Peter Rabbit is once again the naughty rabbit and does get a dose of his own medicine.The pop-ups are clever, mostly. A couple are just simple images, like a bird pulling up a worm. It is classic Beatrix Potter, so no negative comments from me! I had two books to read that day, so I skipped some of the pop-ups. The child who checked out the book notified me that I missed some.

"I recently discovered ""Louisiana: My First Pocket Guide"" in a store of teacher aids. Aha, exclaimed I! I flipped through the little book and thought, Yes, I declare, I think I can use this in a challenger game.I'm the school librarian. I have a set of almanacs that came with a jeopardy type game. Each child has an almanac, they are divided into teams, and there's one scorekeeper on each team. We've played a dozen times. All ages from 4th grade through 8th love the challenge of finding the precise answer in the almanac. Trust me, they know what is in an almanac and the fastest way to find anything.There is no game with the pocket book about Louisiana, but the book is divided and labeled by colored interior tabs. For example, the first is red and labeled ""Louisiana Basics."" It includes government and many state symbols, which occupy pages 4-16. One fact (which is news to me) is that the diatomic accordion is the state musical instrument. There's a word I used to teach when I taught world literature at the high school level: syncretism. It means the fusion of different things to create something new. Germans first brought the accordion to Louisiana in the mid-1870s. Cajuns from Nova Scotia from France adapted the German version to make it their own, thus  the Cajun accordion, or diatomic (no explanation given).Other tab categories include Louisiana history, geography, people, places, nature, and miscellany. I am a bit annoyed that Terry Bradshaw was not listed under People and Kordell Stewart was. After all, Bradshaw is a three-ring Super Bowl winner.Other than picky things (as cited above), this book is well-researched, written, and coordinated into logical categories. Carole Marsh is a respected writer and does well with all her books. I have the paper pack version with 96 pages, counting the back cover. I plan to buy a class set of these little gems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332N98371OAI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0635013088#wasThisHelpful","R332N98371OAI2","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let the big names begin, notably Mireille Enos. What? Not heard of her? You will, especially when Season 2 of ""The Killing"" begins April 1, on AMC. Ms Enos plays Sarah Linden, a Seattle detective, already jaded at mid-30'ish, stymied by her own past police mistakes, and ready to leave for sunny California and an eagerly awaiting fiance.So, on her last day two significant events change her life, whether for good or bad is yet to be determined. A young high school student is found dead by an intentional drowning in the truck of a car, not any car, but the car of a prominent candidate for mayor. The viewer must ask and continues to do so for the rest of the season: Did he do it? If not him, one of his campaign people? Not them, then who did?Event one, then, is the killing and Linden's assignment to the case. Her last day turns into more days as she hunts clues. Right there, simultaneously with her assignment, is the walk-in by her replacement, Joel Kinnaman as Holder, an undercover drug agent, recently transferred, and shady to say the least. Even though his behavior is questionable at times, he becomes her working partner instead of her replacement.Together, they pursue the case, diligently and forthrightly--at least Linden does. Meanwhile, life intrudes with problems from her son, her ex-, and Holder's telephone calls. Clues in the case point one way then another. The murderer could be anyone. Not only that, but people connected to the drowned girl reveal their own shady or corrupt behavior. No one is innocent here.The season is often slow-paced, with each scene carefully set for suspense, surprise revelations, connections leading into various directions. Danger always lurks. Sometimes the suspense is enough to make the viewer want to scream and shout: What's next? Who did it?""The Killing"" is an excellent production with excellent character development even from seemingly minor characters, kind of red herring toss-outs--or maybe not. Maybe any one of the minors could be the killer. It's that kind of suspense, that kind of story. Know how a program will end a season with a real cliff-hanger? ""The Killing"" dangled a shocker!! So I have been waiting for Season 2 ever since.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AM2RG67LQBKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TSNPGK#wasThisHelpful","R1AM2RG67LQBKC","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the books at my recent book fair, ""National Geographic Kids Ultimate U.S. Road Trip Atlas"" was my favorite. I'm the librarian/chair of the book fair, thus I familiarize myself with every book on the case shelves. As a cartophile (map lover), I immediately grabbed this book and Aha! thrilled to its pages!I evaluate such a book of the 50 states by what is written about my home state, Louisiana. I begin there/here. Each state is allotted two pages. The state map fills one page and information and state symbols the other. The little roads are missing--after all, it takes a big fold-out to include those--but all the state and federal roads are intact. How do I know? A rather narrow state road, 28, runs between Federal Highway 171 and Interstate 49. So what? My grandparents lived in a small community, Simpson, along 28. No, Simpson didn't make the map, but 28 is there.What is included for each state are these items:1. 5 Cool things to do here (In Louisiana you can visit the Rose Garden in Shreveport, take a Bayou Boat Tour, visit the Aquarium of the Americas, go through Cajun Country, and tour the French Quarter of New Orleans. A green line exactly locates each place.)2. A summary paragraph3. Roadside attractions, like Mardi Gras World, a musuem showing how a float is made4. Odd information: Did you know that alligators must stay at least 200 yards away from the Mardi Gras parade route.Each state is set up similarly. Imagine how children can have fun with this--and learn during the summer on those ghastly road trips. The U. S. Road Atlas is most beneficial.I just flipped open to a particular state. Question: Which state is divided into two parts by the Chesapeake Bay? Yes, if you live near this region, you can answer that. I could not have answered the question. Or this one: In which state is the Wild Horses Assateague State Park? Answer to both questions is Maryland. OK, one more about Maryland: Which state gave up some of its land to form Washington, D.C.?At an incredibly low price, you can have this book for your children, your students, or, ahem, for yourself. I bought (with library funds) 10 copies for a project I plan to do soon with my middle elementary students.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSB2POMWKJ5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426309333#wasThisHelpful","R2WSB2POMWKJ5Z","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These little ""pretty pink prayer purses""--3 to be exact-- sat on a display table all week in my book fair which was held recently at my school. Because they represented ""doo dads"" to me, I paid them no attention until I started packing up Saturday morning. O.K., I thought what is inside these things? After opening and reading, I discovered a treasure, a genuine treasure. What a clever way to teach a child how to pray.I'll use my great-niece as a case in point. Cadie loves purses, her favorite color is pink, and she, along with most of her family, began going to church every Sunday and Wednesday, true followers. My mother heard Cadie praying the other day--she was praying for candy. She apparently has learned to pray for everything. What My Pretty Pink Prayer Purse does is to teach a child how to pray beyond a prayer for candy.Inside, the purse becomes a pretty picture book about prayer. ""It tells me how, when, and what I need to do."" Pray alone, with a friend, with your mother, any time, anywhere. Then the book gets into specifics: give God thanks for various things, ask forgiveness, to be a better person. The conclusion is lovely for a child: ""[R]emember that God looks forward to listening when you pray.""Is the purse durable? The exterior is hard plastic, the pages are coated for better wear. The first and last pages are glued to the insides of the purse. There is no attachment to the spine, thus the book cannot tear out. One child can easily maintain this purse for a good while. As for multiple check-outs, I'm pretty sure the purses will withstand frequent use, as much as regular books anyway. Credit for text and design goes to Gabrielle Mercer, the lovely pink, green, and white illustrations to Lara Ede.So, not only did I buy a pink prayer purse for Cadie, I (as librarian) also bought the other two to put into my school library (""I bought"" means with book fair profits). I look forward to seeing the girls' faces when they discover these pretty pink prayer purses. As for Cadie, I will come back here and report her reaction. She's a hoot, she is, and I look forward to that reaction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31O40YL8YKT77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848795467#wasThisHelpful","R31O40YL8YKT77","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess for a long time to come films will be made about apartheid in South Africa: in its devastating consequences for all people involved even long after it is declared illegal. ""Skin"" holds up a blinding mirror to show apartheid's incendiary damage to just one family.Pa and Ma are your typical Afrikaner family--white, middle-class, with eventually three children. Typical becomes atypical with the birth of that first child--female and definitely not white, but definitely theirs. Pa, played sternly by Sam Neill, goes through legal precedent to have their young daughter, Sandra,  declared ""white."" It seems that geneticists had already begun their study in the occasional birth of ""black"" children into ""white"" families. So, African Sandra appeared, Afrikaner she was proclaimed.Can you imagine Sandra's dilemma growing up? Legally white, but with the visible stain of the legacy of racist society reminding her at every turn that she is an enigma? At her graduation her parents seek out a potential husband for her. Each white man knows she is ""white"" but treats her as she looks to him. Meanwhile, fully feeling her contradictory status, Sandra falls in love with a local African who does business with her father in his produce store.Can you imagine Sandra's pain at choosing between her birthright and her physical calling. Sophie Okonedo plays Sandra's pain with perfect pitch. They have a baby and live happily within the confines of an African village, one of the makeshift kind on the edge of white society. But it's home and finally, Sandra is welcome and happy.Can you imagine Sandra's pain to learn her father burns every iota of Sandra out of their lives. She chose black instead of white. He could not bend his racist heritage to accept an African into his family, although by skin, his daughter has African heritage. No, no, legally, she is white.And, thus, we meet the ugly fist of racism in just one of its myriad forms. Whether it is apartheid in South Africa or slavery and the aftermath of the ""end"" of slavery in the United States or whatever form it takes across the world, racism is ugly, vile, destructive, and ultimately, incendiary, as is the symbol of fire eating up all traces of blackness out of Pa's household. Sam Neill's character has white skin, the good skin, the skin of acceptance and dominance and all the good things of life. Sandra chose the other. That was unforgivable.There's more, of course, to this story, a true story, but I have given enough of an introduction to its whole. Just as Americans have made many films, written many books bout the ugliness of racism in their own country, to try to explain it away, to understand it, to finally acknowledge it, South Africans are working through their own ugliness. ""Skin"" is a most worthy film toward this understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAAM5CPF3G8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D45NZ6#wasThisHelpful","R3UAAM5CPF3G8W","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not there yet, but I can appreciate the wild colors, the unusual techniques, the ""beyond the edge""-ness of ""Quilting Arts."" In fact, I can sit down with one issue and oohh and aahh over so many of the art works derived from that tiny sector of wild imagination and creative talent of those who do.I once heard that it takes the avant garde to get us past whatever page we're stuck on in history. Quilting Arts is that avant garde movement.Let me count the ways. I'm looking at the December 2010/January 2011 issue (#48). The article and project I most like is ""Create Movement with thread sketching"" (14). In fact, the content itself is excellent artistic information given any media. ""All well-composed art has movement: flow or sense of direction that moves the eye across and around the piece"" (14). Then the writer, Susan Brubaker Knapp, gives the elements of movements: direction of lines, perspective, repetition, and the placement of objects and color values.Her example is from ""Snow Squall,"" in which a bitter wind blows ice crystals across the surface. And, let me tell ya!-- you can see the movement through the threads. This thread quilting is amazing! A boxed comment warns against quitting once you reach the tipping point--when you think your thread accumulation looks horrible. Keep going--it will become a source of beauty and pride..I am giving details on one technique to show the possibility of the reader/quilter actually replicating such a tedious, time-consuming, yet ultimately rewarding artwork that is called quilting arts.Other articles in this particular issue include these:""Quilted and Painted Canvases""""Metal as a Surface Embellishment""""Creating Your Own Cloth from Stitch""In this tenth anniversary issue the magazine introduces 10 innovative techniques, including using the thermofax, printing with a brayer, plein air printing, lighting up your art quilt, and adding digital imagery on fabric.To the staid eye  ""Quilting Arts"" would be horrible to look at. I can hear one of my friends now hurl ugly words at the magazine, but to the eager eye seeking new outlets, new frontiers, the magazine is a well-spring of wild beauty, bold colors, found object type of creating.Besides the articles one of the draws for me in this magazine is the ads. I love the beauty and content. There are so many travel opportunities tied in with quilting work and sources for purchase of all types of cloth. Here's my favorite. It's a close-up of five of those light wooden baskets in which apples are stored. Instead of apples, there are balls wrapped in cloth so it looks like the balls are harvested cloth balls. Each basket features a variety of one color and patterns. One has reds, another yellows, blue-greens, purples and yellow-greens. Just beautiful, creative, imaginative.Just like ""Quilting Arts""!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2275IRZEQ84QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000060MIH#wasThisHelpful","R2275IRZEQ84QS","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I find a magazine or book like ""Sew Somerset: the art of creative sewing with mixed-media,"" I feel a world of possibilities has opened in my head! Wow! What I most like about this semi-annual is its variety. As labeled on the cover: ""Art quilts, wearables, books, ATCs, cards, & more!""The current cover alone shows the possibilities: Sew-licious postcard project, Sewing machine doodles, Antique bird quilts. However, the two that drew me in and made me plunk down the dollars for this book/magazine are these: ""Field Guide to Creativity"" and ""Mini Art Journals"" and ""Sewn Scrap Houses"" and ""Inspired by Nature"" and my absolute favorite--""The Little White Book of Everyday Inspirations."" Yes, I know, I listed more than two, didn't I? That's my point--IF you like mixed media based on textiles, then ""Sew Somerset"" is for you! You cannot stop at one or two of the projects--you must consider more.However, I will describe this ""little white book."" The creator, Mary Waldon, took old linen napkins, cut them into 4 x 5 ""squares"" and then began decorating them. I plan to find some specialty fabric resembling old lace (or antique it myself). Then print a bird on fabric as my key piece, then add bits of favorite scraps, ace, rickrack, crocheted bits, etc. to create one page. The facing page will contain inspirational phrases of poetry, philosophical insights, favorite sayings, also decorated. Each two-page set has a thematic word, like ""patience"" or ""hope"" and so on. This would make a fabulous gift for a young bride or young lady graduating college.The photographs accompanying each project are so clear and explanatory, the instructions are easy to follow. I also love the ads throughout and often find them online. The pages are thicker than slick magazine pages, the book is slightly larger than a standard-sized magazine.

"First, it was the shock of learning that I had diabetes. Next, my doctor advised me to buy a glucose monitoring system in order to keep up with my glucose level throughout the day. BUT! The biggest surprise was going to the pharmacy to pick out a system when what to my most amazed eyes I saw, not one, not two, but several choices, each seeming to be as different and alike as the next one. Oh my gosh, what to do? So many choices, so little knowledge!What guided me was my mother's suggestion to find the new one that was sort of ""painless"" sticking.

A little zippered compartment comes with the unit for parts storage. The box says ""small: fits in your pocket or purse."" Perhaps that is true of the meter itself or the lancing device, but altogether with all the parts placed in the carrying case, the total space it occupies will fit into a purse. To give an idea of case size: think jumbo hot dog bun. Pocket? Depends upon the size. But I do love how there is a little compartment or zippered space or slip space for each component.Here's how it looks: Open the zipper and the case flips open. On the left are two hard plastic hinges to hold the meter and the lancing device. Between them is a heavy, wide elastic band that holds the little tub of test strips. To the right is a zippered section to hold the lancets themselves and a little slip-in pocket for little packets of alcohol swabs. On the outside is a long pocket to hold whatever. I put my chart of daily readings and one of norms there. There is one more outside elastic band, but I don't know its purpose. And a flip out, velcro-attached band. Also a mystery.Now how do the units work? Other reviewers indicate inaccuracies, but I have no idea. My doctor feels the readings are accurate according to her lab results. The only error readings I get occur when I don't insert the test strip in exactly right. My fault, not the unit's. The meter also ""remembers"" readings a dozen times back for reference, I guess.About the ""more comfortable"" testing: nah, a needle is a needle, but I'm needle-shy. Actually, on a scale of one to ten with ten being the most uncomfortable, I give the little lancet a 2. That's pretty darn good (for a needle).Oh, the meters come in lovely colors. I chose lime green and love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7PDQSJGE2OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KK8HBY#wasThisHelpful","RW7PDQSJGE2OP","A3M6RVUVZOQZLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Kinda Cool,"" is what his five year old daughter thought of Ted's reading her a bedtime story ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" during his Senate  filibuster. This was the only time his daugther had an interest in anything her Dad had done in the Senate Ted along with senators such as Lee and Paul have fought tirelessly in the Senate against the erosion of American liberties. All Tea Party Senators, they have fought to defend the Constitution and to keep it from being further eroded (trampled on) by liberals in both parties. In this informative book, Ted details his ceaseless efforts to accomplish these goals. He also tells of his growing up years,his college years, his time working for a chief justice of the Supreme Court, his tenure as assistant attorney general for Texas and the people he loves the most, his wife and two daughters..What impresses me the most about Ted is his moral integrity and his refusal to compromise on important issues. I agree with Ted's stance on many issues, such as foreign policy, the boarder, Planned Parenthood, solutions to turn around the fiscal crisis and more. Ted is a wise, commonsense man with sensible solutions to our countries woes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17975ONO9ARTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365614#wasThisHelpful","R17975ONO9ARTL","A3ENVHXOY03P5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ENVHXOY03P5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a well written historical novel. It  gives the reader a look at Roman and Israeli society in Jesus day. It was an enjoyable book. While not a religious man, Pilate did have a conscience. Believing Jesus to be innocent, he did his best his best to spare him from death. Only when the Jewish religious leaders stirred up the common man to demand the Savior's death, did he consent to it. Pilate and his childless wife had a good marriage. She was religious and eventually accepted Jesus as her Savior.

"Entrepreneurs, not robber barons is what they were. While none of them were perfect, their innovative ideas made life better for all Americans and at times other parts of the world as well. They cut costs for necessary goods and services. There were two classes of entrepreneurs, political and market. The political entrepreneurs were lobbyists, who depended on government assistance to fund their projects.The market ones funded their own projects The political ones always failed.

"When will we ever learn? Government subsidies do not work, but free markets do. It's about political entrepreneurs versus free market entrepreneurs. Political entrepreneurs are looking for a government handout and  because they usually aren't all that concerned with turning a profit, they aren't careful in how they spend the money they are given. Free market entrepreneurs who are paying their own bills and must make a profit are concerned about quality and cost. From Astor and the fur trade, to Vanderbilt and steamships, to the Wright brothers and the airplane, to Hill and the railroads, to Mitchell and fracking the list of free market successes is long. So is the list of government subsidized failures. And it doesn't matter if the subsidy is a federal or state one. This is a well written, interesting,  informative book.

"Of all the books I've read about the massacre of children in various countries, this one was my favorite. These Sudanese youth spent much of their growing up years in refugee camps in various countries, hungry, thirsty,  disease ridden, traveling long distances from one place to another (without food or water during their travels which were most often through the dessert) and abused. With all of the hardship they experienced they never stopped caring for each family member and even strangers when they could do so. Three of the boys eventually come to the U.S; to attend college.

"The  book was riveting but extremely sad. It was hard to put  down. It is the story of a curious (always questioning everything), strong willed young Cambodian girl and her upper middle class family who were forced to flee from their home in Phnom Penh by Pol Pot's evil Khmer Rouge  mercenaries. Long was five when her family fled to a work camp. After her Father was killed when Long was six years old, she and all but one of her siblings were soon sent to live on their own. It was thought that they could survive better if separated. Long ended up in a camp that trained young girls to be soldiers. She was always dirty, filled with head lice and hungry. She survived by hating those who did these atrocities to her family. Without hatred she would have been consumed with sadness. Eventually the Vietnamese liberated Cambodia and the family members that were still alive reunited and went to live with a kind uncle in the country. By this time her Mom and youngest sister have been killed.  Her oldest sister had also died of starvation. Eventually she and one of her brothers came to America. It was a fictionalized historical novel. No five-eight year could remember in such vivid detail all that happened to her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT58ROV5YDED6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060856262#wasThisHelpful","RT58ROV5YDED6","A3ENVHXOY03P5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ENVHXOY03P5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It definitely wasn't the success story some of the better constructed WPA projects make it seem.

"Plastic is everywhere.From children's toys to shopping bags you can't avoid it. The author isn't an extremist who hates anything plastic, but admits. that not all plastic is bad. Some of it is good, such as that used for cars, airplanes, computers,  phones, and medical equipment (which is often life saving). Some like Tupperware  containers are bad and some like plastic grocery shopping bags and disposable bottled water are downright ugly Also, some kinds of plastic are much more toxic than other kinds. The book's author has done thorough research, and given us an informative, well written book to read. His solutions for reducing the plastic we use are sensible and doable. The chapter on the history of plastic was really interesting. The author has a funny sense of humor.As another reviewer commented, he leaves out some good alternative solutions, such as glass water bottles.  Also you don't have to drink either bottled water or tap water (which often tastes terrible). We have a reverse osmosis filtration unit which we love. It's an affordable one from Sears.

"The book is short but good. No fluff. Just solid Biblical analysis of Psalm 91. I love and do mean love the Hebrew meanings to words. If you are unsure as to what a particular passage is saying, look up its main words in the Hebrew or Greek. The author gives us the Hebrew definitions to the main words in this Psalm and then shares her conclusions concerning God's character and provision for us based on the meaning to those words in their original language.

For example, I have  always endeavored to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, even when they don't do it. The last part is my addition.

Apple cider vinegar has a higher pH. Vinegar is put on at the end of your shampoo to make your hair less alkaline.  It is also hard on the hair. Also, it isn't acidic enough to leave your hair its normal pH. I used it twice and stopped. One lady who used it for three years had itchy scalp, dandruff and constant split ends.

"While I've been married awhile, weddings now often cost a lot, so I decided to read this book on budget weddings. Also a good friend is getting married. The book was well written, with many doable ideas to cut your wedding expenses. Two ideas I especially like. Since your guests are so important and you want to it  to be a memorable day for them, don't send them away hungry. Skimp on something other than food. If I were to do my wedding over, I would certainly do just that. You can have a buffet, which is cheaper than a dinner served at your table, but send them away with a full stomach. My other favorite idea is,  if you have enough household stuff, let people contribute money toward your honeymoon. Just because you have a budget wedding, doesn't mean you can't have what's important to you included in it. Armed with the facts and proper planning you can do just that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAJ83V4WYAT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4FSMS8#wasThisHelpful","RGAJ83V4WYAT4","A3ENVHXOY03P5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ENVHXOY03P5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am the spouse of ""Wholly His"" so this is written from a man's perspective. For the product to be any good at all the phone has to be secure in the holster, the holster has to be secure on the belt and the phone has to come out quickly to avoid missing a call. The i-Blason meets all three objectives very well.  The belt clip has a stiff steel spring, not just springy plastic plus a hooked end that goes around the belt. I have had belt hooks be secure for several months only to get knocked off when hit a certain way, I don't think that will happen with the i-Blason. Maximum security is with the phone vertical so gravity add to the security; I think it would hold horizontally but haven't tested it that way. It can also be oriented at an angle as the clip rotates with 15 increments.  The fit is excellent and the port openings line up precisely. The phone's three side buttons are covered with corresponding rubber buttons but they still operate as usual. The review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the feel of the shape and material in the hand, I like it every time I pick it up.  The kick stand will require a firm if not hard pull to get it out so use two of your strongest finger nails. i-Blason has put a lot of thought in to the design of this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEMD53D53M1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY0VQV8#wasThisHelpful","R3EEMD53D53M1Y","A3ENVHXOY03P5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ENVHXOY03P5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is there life after death? According to John Schoenheit there is, but not until the insurrection. After a person dies, his body and soul (breath) is gone and he is dead or asleep in the grave. Our spirit (soul) isn't floating around heaven if saved or hell if wicked and lost without a body. Rather at death we stop breathing and our bodies decay in the grave. At the insurrection the saved will receive new bodies and eternal life.  The wicked will be judged and perish by being burned up in the lake of fire. The lake of fire is not eternal. Schoenheit gives thorough Scriptural backing for his beliefs about the state of the dead. He does the same with the history of the Biblically inaccurate idea of the immortal soul. Most if not all of us have consoled a person(s) at a funeral with the comforting but false idea that their loved one is in heaven. As Schoenheit rightly contends, death is nasty. It's the wages or punishment for sin. In the future I will console people differently. Having lost loved ones myself, I know how hard it is. You'll never see or talk to them again on earth.

"Is God who is love and there is no unrighteousness in all he does, the author of evil? Does he cause bad things to happen to good people or even bad people for that matter? John Schoenheit contends and thoroughly backs his ideas with Scriptural proof that God isn't the author of evil. He does not cause  bad things to happen to anyone. Satan is the author of the non-stop evil and  wickedness we see all around us. We do not have to nor should we call evil good. Evil like its author is wicked. While God is all powerful, he is not all controlling. He gave angelic beings and man a free will. That means man and angels can chose to disobey God and do evil and he won't stop them. This is also the reason God doesn't just eliminate evil in all its nasty forms. Ever since the fall where man relinquished dominion over the earth to Satan, wars, violence, power hungry, greedy despots has been the norm. Satan loves to blame his evil works on God.  This will soon end when our Savior returns to set up his kingdom.  Satan and all else that is evil will perish.

"Reports of war and violence dominate the news. No thinking person will deny that the world is headed towards a third world war and the return of our Savior. Who is responsible for all the evil that is taking pace today and has been since Adam and Eve first sinned? One chapter after the fall Cain kills Abel. Gregory Boyd contends that God stepped inside of time and doesn't know every detail of what will happen in the future. He has perfect memory of the past and can use that knowledge to make predictions for the future. He is  all powerful and able to make his predictions come to pass in his time. Just because God is all powerful, does not mean he is all controlling. He has given humans and angels (good and evil ones) a free will. They can choose to do good or evil. God does not control either humans or angels every decision. Granted it's a limited free will and in the end God triumphs over evil and the wicked perish.The book is 293 pages long. It is not a fast read, but well worth every minute of the time it takes to read it. He thoroughly backs each of his assertions with Scripture. Boyd talks about the pagan concept of evil and what both Testaments have to say about the subject. Satan and his evil angels rebelled and have been doing all in the power ever since to destroy God, the cosmos and all beings who side with the Creator. Satan and his fallen angels  are created beings, with limited powers, who will day soon be destroyed. They are the authors of evil.

"These hard taco shells are wider at the bottom than those traditionally sold which usually narrow at the bottom. That helps prevent cracking as you fill them. Of course, they will still crack as you bite into them but at least you can fill them. They are, like all other hard taco shells - quite brittle.Certainly this shape is an improvement over those that narrow at the bottom.I found the 6 pack (15 shells each) shipped (90 shells total) was cheaper at $12.00 total than my over-priced supermarket. They should keep forever.There is nothing special here except for a better shape.I find their taste bland, which may be a good thing, because it allows your ingredients to shine. I view them as a crunchy, largely tasteless, edible container.I wish they were not so brittle.Warning: Amazon co-mingles reviews of various Old El Paso products as if a hard taco shell was the same as a soft tortilla shell!

"As an audio engineer and past member of the AES (Audio Engineering Society) I was curious about this CD.Unfortunately it contains dubious and potentially dangerous test signals. The company appears to no longer existWhat first caught my attention about this CD was the 5HZ signal. That is far below the range of human hearing which is traditionally viewed as 20hz to 20,000hz.Want to experience 5HZ?  See if you can move the palm of your hand back and forth 5 times in a second. If you can, you just created 5hz which can also be referred to as 5 cycles per second. I can't conceive what use this signal is except to destroy a sub-woofer. It certainly can't be heardIf any reviewer heard anything - it was NOT 5hz. In all probabilty it was the harmonic distortion of his sub-woofer being vastly over loaded (harmonic distortion is a multiple of the original frequency - but is pure distortion of the original signal ; For example - a third order harmonic distortion would be 15hz (3 x 5hz yet still not audible), fourth order would be 20hz, and so on. Any reviewer that claims he/she was hearing 5hz was in fact hearing 4th order or much higher harmonic distortion.I'll add that ""hearing"" 20hz is more like feeling it There are very few sub-woofers that can produce a 20hz signal without excessive harmonic distortion. When I say ""very few"" I mean VERY FEW and they normally employ a 15"" speaker and are quite expensive. Fortunately, except for wealthy purists, a very good bass response down to 30 or 40 hz is very satisfying. Still it won't be cheap.Testing room acoustics and frequency response is highly complex and from what I can see this disc is not a serious effort","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U64993OXYZS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WKQ5CI#wasThisHelpful","R3U64993OXYZS5","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an audio engineer and prior member of the AES (Audio Engineering Society) I'd like to offer the following commentsMost reviews are very confused about this ""Digital Sound Noise Meter"". I also should note that many of the reviewers were supplied with free samples!I'M not sure exactly what a ""Digital Sound Noise Meter"" is but I'll assume that it measures db SPL, aka sound pressure levels, using the db scale.Without knowing the frequency response of the microphone, it is largely a useless device. One reviewer, in a video, says it is 300hz to 8,000 hz without specifying deviation. That's close to the range of a telephone. (Human hearing goes from 20hz to 20,000hz). Other reviewers state the manufacturer specifies it is plus or minus 2db at 1000hz at 94db SPL. To understand exactly how meaningless that spec is consider the meter claims a range of 40 to 130 db SPL yet it is only tested at 94 db SPL. Secondly human hearing, as noted, runs from 20 hz to 20,000 hz/ Most meters would cover maybe 130 hz to perhaps 8,000 hz. Finally, the manufacturer self certifies these meaningless specs and no independent lab confirms them which would be the norm with quality meters.I have no doubt the numbers on its display increase in some manner as the sound gets louder. So what! It takes a fair amount of money to manufacture a good microphone. It takes even more money to calibrate it so it accurately displays db SPL. I doubt, in a hundred years, you could manufacture an accurate microphone for $20.00But lets assume you have a quality meter. You still have to know how to use it!!Typical misconceptions: Distance from the sound source REALLY matters. Place your cell phone (using speakerphone) and this meter next to each other and you'll see a fairly high db SPL level. Move the meter 6 inches away and the db SPL will drop considerably. Move the ""meter"" a foot away and it will drop considerably more.I'm not sure what this device is beyond a microphone of dubious quality that vaguely increases its reading as a sound gets louder. That may or may not relate to true sound pressure levels.What is clear is that some top notch reviewers don't know what they are reviewing. For example: place this ""meter"" very close to a loudspeaker and you will then get a very high db SPL level as one video reviewer did. You could then incorrectly pronouce that speaker as damaging to human hearing. That is almost certainly the wrong conclusion. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how distance effects sound pressure levels.Another easy test: speak with any friend in some typical setting. Now move closer, without your friend changing their volume or tone. Put your ear next to your friends mouth (if you dare and I don't advise this) and you will see how distance effects volume (aka db - SPL)I'm afraid there are a number of very flawed reviews that have little understanding of this type of product or how to use it.The seller has capitalized on many well intended yet very flawed reviews by highly rated reviewers to promote sales. Many reviewers were provided with free samples.Within a day of when I posted this review I received a YES ""Was this review helpful to you?"" Yet the next day two negative votes came in. These negative voters left no comments. I wonder who posted those votes.

"El Yucateco makes some decent hot sauces but like many companies, they produce a confusing array of hot sauces - each different - hoping to capture every possible segment of the hot sauce market. This brand is rarely great but usually reliable - hence my two star rating which may be a bit harsh. The Chipotle and Jalapeño varieties are excellent - 4 or 5 star.This sampler will give you a good introduction. The brown Habanero is quite potent - mostly fiery heat. The red Habanero is almost as hot but has some tomato mixed in. The green Habanero has a bit of garlic and is still quite potent. Yet the brown is the hottest - mostly pure heat. I personally prefer the green.The Chipotle sauce is in an entirely different class, made from a smoked dried jalapeño pepper. No where as hot as the above but truly excellent.El Yucateco almost makes a superb jalapeño sauce that is not included in this sampler, which is a shame.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WQHO7FRAEPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000GHNUE#wasThisHelpful","R23WQHO7FRAEPX","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried other so-called Worcestershire sauces and none have come close to the original Lee and Perrins.At $47.00 including shipping for 3 gallons it was a great buy. Three of us split this order. I use this sauce in Bloody Marys and on steaks, hamburgers or any other type of beef. It is also wonderful in french onion soup. Unlike other reviewers, I don't marinate my steaks in it. Rather I douse it liberally over steaks, a number of times, as they cook on the grill.But the question remains, what will you do with 3 gallons? You could split it up with friends as I did. That is 384 ounces!  First consider the price advantage. 10 to 15 ounces of this sauce costs about $11.00 on Amazon. Update (August 2014) - now $5.44 ($0.54 / oz) & FREE Shipping on orders over $35. So there is/was a huge price advantage even if you threw two gallons away. .Taste: a Bloody Mary would never be complete without a dash of this sauce. However you'll never need very much of this sauce for that purpose. But on steaks, hamburgers, etc using a heavy dose several times per side as they cook (I don't marinate) --- you can use up quite a bit of sauce. What I've found is this keeps the steaks very juicy and imparts a very subtle flavor that you'll miss when it is absent.Highly recommended for steaks/beef, french onion soup, and Bloody MarysUpdate (August 2014): Since smaller bottles are more fairly priced think twice about ordering 3 gallons","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E77A7NSNOTWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00469PS6C#wasThisHelpful","R1E77A7NSNOTWU","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is not much more to say other than these are a fine and affordable set of test leads. They are longer than you probably need at 3 feet each. They are color coded, the wires are soldered to the alligator clip, and that is combined with a crimped strain refief. A LARGE alligator clip is used (about the length of a large paper clip but fatter). I can't, as an electrical engineer, imagine who would want more from such a simple product.PS: wire gauge (aka wire size/diameter) is in the range of 20. That is an educated guess. Far too many reviews have concentrated on this minor topic! FYI: A larger gauge number denotes a SMALLER physical diameter of wire. However at three feet in length, even a small diameter wire (larger gauge number) is perfect for 99% of all testing situations. While you don't want resistance in a test lead - resistance is calcuated by the diameter of the wire (a bigger diameter being better) times length (shorter lengths being better). Given the short length of these leads they are fine, typical of what has always been used in test leads for decades, and appropriate for most applications.Who might NOT want these test leads? While this list is hardly complete, no one should use these test leads going to a starter motor on a car for example, which draws massive amounts of current. I'm sure electricans can come up with other very heavy ampere (current) situations that would need a larger diameter wire too but in most ""normal"" situations these test leads are fine and most users should not worry about the wire gauge/wire diameter.Confusion: Apparently some people have received shorter lengths of cables and also inferior ones. I suspect these were NOT Elenco cables. I'd simply recommend to these people - if you are sure you ordered Elenco cables but did not receive them - well - return them at the sellers expense. The part number on my bag of cables is TL-6LG and says ""Elenco Electronics, Inc"".

"I'm an electrical engineer and for over 30 years I have relied on Deoxit for cleaning, rejuvenating, lubricating and protecting electrical connections. It is very close to being magical - cleaning noisy switches, intermittent relays, and potentiometers (volume controls). Once applied, you will get many more years of additional service.Craig (aka Hosa/the name of their distributor) Deoxit is the very best electrical contact cleaner available and it also improves electrical performance and protects contacts for years to come. However Craig makes a dizzing array of cleaners/contact shields so their products are rarely used by non-professionals. Yet, for decades, these products have been and remain the platinum standard for cleaning/improving/lubricating and protecting any type of electrical connection. Often these products seem almost magical in their ability to rejuvenate switches, relays, potentiometers (volume controls), etcDespite a confusing array of products their most universal product is what Craig or Hosa (Craig's distributor) calls its D5 series. If you see D5 in the product number you've likely got the most appropriate product! In fact, a D5 series cleaner is required for any connection that is NOT new or already perfectly clean.The most universal product is a DeOxit D5 series SPRAY. It cleans contacts, flushes away the garbage, lubricates and leaves behind a protective coating that improves the electrical connection and also protects it for years to come.The only problem I have with the brush on version is that it is rare that you can actually get to the contacts of whatever you are working on.

"DeoxIT is manfuctured by Caig but is often sold under the name of one their distrubutors ""Hosa"". Whether the product you buy says ""Caig DeoxIT"" or ""Hosa DeoxIT"" - it is the same product. ""DeoxIT"" is a registered tradename and that is what you are looking for. Hopefully that information eliminates some initial confusion.As an electrical engineer I've used DeoxIT for over 30 years. In fact - it is the only contact cleaner, lubricant, and contact enhancer I trust. From Boeing, Bose, General Electric, Hewlett Pack, etc, etc this product is the gold standard and widely used in manufacturing and within small professional circles.Prior to the internet and companies like Amazon this product was unknown and largely unavailable.Having said that ---- every consumer should know that ALL DeoxIT products are superior, ALL formulas are virtually guaranteed to do NO harm and even if you don't use the optimum formula of DeoxIT it will still, quite likely, improve a poor connection and/or protect a new one.DeoxIT is sold in 4 broad categories.D series - first and foremost a heavy duty contact cleaner with contact enhancer/protection - I'd say this is Caig/Hosa's most universal productS series (aka Shield S series) - for outdoor environments. Particularily benefical in salt or other harsh outdoor environments. If the connections are not new - cleaning with a D series is required. I'd use this on a boat, an outdoor generator, etcG Series (aka Gold series) - designed for gold and base metals. It offers minor cleaning properties. For gold contacts it offers near perfect protection and will enhance electrical connections for gold, etc. However its cleaning properties are minimal and since gold does not oxidize and usually offers a near perfect connection to begin with this product is largely unneeded. Yet, if you have highly sensitive circuit boards with gold plated connectors, operating at very low voltages, using gold plated connectors that might act up from time to time then this is your product. If you have other gold plated connections such as used in audio, etc this product is largely unneeded yet it will do no harm and may slightly enhance the connection over the very long term (years) as would the D series product.F Series (aka Fader F series) - desiged for ""faders"" aka ""volume controls"" aka ""pots"" or potentiometers aka rotary controls. If that applies to what you are working on then this is the most appropriate cleaner/lubricant. It works on carbon based (extremely common) or conductive plastic controls which essentially encompasses the entire universe of rotary controls.In the end, I hope this description helps you pick the best formula for your needs but the bottom line is the Caig/Hosa contact cleaners/enhancers are all first class and even if you pick a less than perfect formulation it will not only do NO harm but likely still fix your problem. The most universal product, as previously noted, is the D series spray cleaner/restorer.You can call Caig at 800-CAIG-123 for advice","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ZBAVGTAAI36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006LVEW#wasThisHelpful","R18ZBAVGTAAI36","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now no one should expect much from a radio in the ten dollar price range and I didn't get much.Volume was fairly weak and the reception was quite poor.I first tested it against my car's radio parked 10 feet away. The car's radio picked up probably four times as many FM stations. It was startling how poor the FM reception of this radio was.I then tested it against Panasonic's RF-2400 portable AM/FM Radio - side by side and the Panasonic played much louder and picked up a few more stations. I'm an electrical engineer and the antennas were orientated the same and I meticulously compared the sound and number of stations received. But that is certainly not an entirely fair comparison - the Sony is a $13.00 radio and the Panasonic a $30 radio. And I don't want to give anyone the impression the Panasonic is a good radio - it isn't - certainly it plays louder than the Sony but it also has rather poor FM reception.I'd pass on this radio - it reeks of cheapness although if you need an inexpensive radio for emergencies when your power is out - the large D cell batteries this radio uses should give you many weeks of service. But D cells are not all that cheap and a battery operated radio would be a poor choice if you use it daily.As an emergency radio I'd give it 3 stars. As a radio I used daily - 1 star.Consider Sony's ICF-38 radio, at about $30.00. It might be a wisher purchase. I have not tried the Sony ICF38 but the reviews are quite positive. The Panasonic is decent but far from good. My Sony ICF10 is being returned. I've had cheap portables purchased 20 years ago that were much better.If I wanted an emergency radio to pack away - given the D batteries it uses - which have huge power reserves compared to AA batteries - I'd buy it for a survival kit.Conclusion: Poor reception, relatively low volume and given it is battery powered only, it is a poor choice for regular use.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPGK1Z98664E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081IKTN6#wasThisHelpful","R2UPGK1Z98664E","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since the headphones had a built-in volume control - my Dad now had a set of headphones he could use and not blast my mother out of the room by turning up the volume too high on the TV.

"HDMI cables are almost universal for connecting high definition audio/visual equipment. A single cable carries audio (stereo, multi-channel DTS, Dolby, etc ), plus digital video signals (these cables are capable of carrying video signals far greater than are currently in use) plus ethernet.You will see various descriptions and HDMI.org - the organization that creates these standards has used a confusing mix of categories and descriptions over the years. This organization now ""forbids"" designations such as HDMI 1.4 which these cables are. Now their highest rated cables can only carry the designation ""high speed"" (or not) and if it applies - ""supports ethernet"". In the past, designations such as HDMI 1.3, etc were allowed. Many manufacturers ignore the current rules so you may see HDMI 1.4 advertised.The bottom line is every HDMI cable ever made, including ones made years ago, have the same pin to pin connections, the same connector and the same number of pins. What has changed REGARDING CABLES is the organization has now required better shielding, construction, etc so the cable can carry more data at a much higher rate. So you can buy this cable sold by Amazon with the assurance it will work with your oldest gear and your newest gear -- equally well and likely will work perfectly for new equipment made years in the future!What is confusing and rather sad is your actual equipment may not support many of the features a high quality HDMI cable supports. What features a manufacturer creates in their equipment has always been a matter of choice for the equipment manufacturer. They can choose what features are present in their equipment and more often than not, that is not clearly stated in the specifications. So one manufacturer can legitimately claim HDMI 1.4 compliance yet many of the potential features of that spec are not be present. Picture this: One manufacturer could employ every feature available in the specification while another choses not to. Yet both manufacturer's could label their equipment as compliant with the current HDMI specification.But the simple beauty of purchasing a ""high speed with ethernet cable"" is you have purchased the BEST possible cable that is almost certainly better than the gear it connects to. And this cable is cheap and will work perfectly with your oldest gear too (assuming it has an HDMI connector).If there was ever a simple buying decision it is with these cables - just buy them! There is zero possibility they won't work perfectly (putting aside a manufacturing defect).To repeat myself: The ultimate bottom line - a ""high speed"" (aka HDMI 1.4 high speed) cable ""with ethernet"" supports any and all features available on the newest gear and will work on the oldest equipment available too.  So if you see ""high speed"" and ""supports ethernet"" - that is the very best designation you can find for a cable. In all likelihood many of the features/data rates this cable can transmit will NOT EXIST even on the most current equipment, including something you bought just yesterday. But given the low cost of the cable do you really care if the cable is better than your gear?BTW - older HDMI cables will likely perform just as well as these newer ones and I would not upgrade your cables needlessly.PS: ""Audio return"" does not affect the cable itself. It is a new feature some manufacturers may or may not employ in their gear. To quote HDMI.org ""All HDMI cables will support Audio Return Channel functionality when connected to Audio Return Channel-enabled devices""Length: add a couple of feet to what you think you need. Remember you want to be able to pull a piece of equipment from a rack or shelf while it still remains connected.I'm an electrical engineer and I passed the test to become a ""certified HDMI installer"" after studying various white papers on the technology. I scored over 90% on my first taking of HDMI.org's test. Somewhere in my downloads is a nice certificate that I guess I'm supposed to display.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YH1LV2FKVTWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052SCU8U#wasThisHelpful","R2YH1LV2FKVTWW","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It had become completely frozen, despite light use.History: I purchased this spreader at a local Home Depot. I used it twice a year to spread fertilizer/lime on a small lawn. I stored it (empty) in my garage between uses. Within three years (about six to eight uses) the metal drive shaft (that spins the propeller) had corroded so badly in its bearing that it could not be freed with oils, solvents, etc. Even an air racket would not free it!I thought I was buying a professional spreader that would last a lifetime but rather I had bought an expensive piece of junk.One last failure: While the spreader was already junk, I put the spreader away in the garage - postponing throwing it out. Come spring cleanup this year - I pulled it out of the garage for trash pickup and noticed the plastic hopper have developed stress cracks and a hole. That is how poorly manufactured the plastic is. And these flaws appeared while the spreader was empty, in storage, in a well ventilated garage!I can honestly state this is the worse piece of equipment I've ever purchased in the last twenty years. If Agri-Fab were willing to ship me a new one of these, each and every year, for life -- I'd pay the asking price. Otherwise - I'd look elsewhere.(BTW: During its short lifetime; it worked extremely well)Free advice to Agri-Fab: Upgrade your drive/propeller shaft to stainless steel and improve the grade of plastic you use in the hopper. Then, you'd have a true winner - everything else is well made. Also - as noted - when it worked - it spread perfectly and with ease. It is a shame these design flaws exist because when it worked, this spreader worked flawlessly.If this review seems contradictory - it is. What you have is a near perfect spreader that suffers from a few cheap components that severely limited its lifespan.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRAIGNP95IGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ET408K#wasThisHelpful","RXRAIGNP95IGR","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all lets define what this product is. I'm an electrical engineer and I hope the following helps.This device has 2 female Ethernet connectors - one at either end. So it is meant to join together two Ethernet cables (which almost always have male connectors on both ends). You can use it with CAT5, CAT5e or CAT6 cables since all share the same pin connections and use the same connector. (It is only the cable itself that differs between these different types of cables). So, quite simply, this coupler can be used to join together two ethernet cables to create a longer length.  If you look at many of the reviews published here - people have done just that with this coupler and, not surprising, it worked perfectly.However, this coupler ALSO fits a ""keystone"" wallplate. Notice in the picture the various latches etc on it. What that means is it will snap into a wall-plate with a ""keystone"" opening/hole (which are common enough on wallplates). So you can buy a wall plate with a ""keystone"" hole (opening), snap this coupler into place on the wall plate and then you take an Ethernet cable with pre-attached male plugs and plug it into the rear of the coupler. Now you have a wall plate with a female jack on the front and you can plug any standard Ethernet cable into this wall plate. Nice and simple, except, of course, that you have to fish the Ethernet cable through your walls, cut an opening in your wall and install a box for the wall-plate.What is NOT to like.1.) This type of coupler generally costs about 90 cents to $1.50 for just one (try monoprice) not $5.00.2.) It assumes you are using pre-wired Ethernet cables - that means you are stuck with purchasing finished cat5e/6 cables of a FIXED length with connectors already installed. That is hardly ideal if you are wiring a Whole House (NOT just joining two existing ethernet cables together) but hardly a problem if you want just to make one or two  connections.This type of connector is useful for those of us that want to either join 2 ethernet cables together OR want to create ONE or TWO wall plate connections, using a pre-purchased cat 5e/6 cable (obviously make sure you purchase the right length of Cat 5e/6 cable) and don't forget you need a keystone wall-plate plus an existing wall box.HOWEVER --- AND HERE IS WHERE I TAKE EXCEPTION WITH SOME POPULAR REVIEWS - This is certainly NOT the best solution for wiring or re-wiring a WHOLE house let alone a small office. If you are starting from scratch and wiring a whole house or office you should use raw cat 5e or cat 6 cable and terminate it without a coupler. Couplers are always a potential weak point (all connections technically are) and keeping your cable lengths as short as possible is another sound guideline. Terminating cat 5/6 cable is reasonably easy. So if you are doing a whole house you should run raw Cat 5e or Cat 6 and terminate it with a ""punch down"" female ethernet keystone jack. The advantage of this is you can keep your cable runs to exactly what is needed and you eliminate a coupler. The disadvantage is you need a tool kit (stripper, crimper and punch down tool). These are often marketed as a network tool kit (at least that is the term Monoprice uses) and they cost about $80.00. But that price ALSO includes a cable tester which is very nice to have and it assures you that you have created very reliable connections.There is nothing wrong with this coupler other than being vastly overpriced or over used as a common connection in a whole house/office setup. If you are just connecting two ethernet cables together this coupler is a perfect solution. But if you want to install a wall-plate - you also need to know that you need to purchase a keystone faceplate, have an existing box in your wall (or buy and install one) and you must purchase pre-finished Cat 5/6 cables of a fixed - and hopefully - correct length.HOWEVER - If you want to install more than a few wall-plates - this is the wrong solution!!!! You should buy bulk cable and eliminate these couplers.CABLE INFO: Cat 5e cable is excellent (100 MHZ) and Cat 6 cable (250 MHZ) is essentially overkill even in a large home/medium sized office but there is no disadvantage to using Cat6 cable except for a slight increase in cost (which is fairly minor). Another comment about Cat 6 -- it is a bit thicker and not quite as easy to run/terminate. Avoid plain Cat 5 cable (in other words: you ONLY want Cat 5e or Cat 6). It is extremely unlikely you will ever need Cat 6, even in a mansion but if you want to future proof a home installation then go with Cat 6 cable if it makes you feel better. Cat 6 is overkill but many of us prefer to use the very best despite no real gains. In a large office environment (and I mean LARGE -  NEW CONSTRUCTION) - CAT 6 is the only way to go assuming a new installation. However, in many offices (small,medium or large), now and in the future Cat5e will work perfectly.Hope this helps!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31L9HM2PD33VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JP92K8#wasThisHelpful","R31L9HM2PD33VX","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A simple portable radio that can be powered by the supplied AC power cord or by 4 AA batteries (not supplied). No storage is provided for the AC cord - an annoyance.I'm an electrical engineer. This portable certainly plays loudly enough but reception, particularly on the FM band, is not good. AM reception was decent, pulling in signals from high powered AM stations that were 60+ miles away without a problem.FM reception was not nearly as good. This radio had trouble pulling in many FM stations in my area. I first compared it to my car stereo parked just 10 feet away and then an old, beat up portable radio, from Radio Shack that was 20 years old. Both were much better than the Panasonic. FM signal reception is mediocre at best. Both the sensitivity (the ability to pick up a station) and selectivity (the ability to tune into one station that is near another one) was fair to poor. On the plus side, this inexpensive portable will work in a power outage and provide music when you are out and about. Its volume is fairly loud.So for $36.00 what can you expect? Maybe (?) no more than this radio provides.In short, I was expecting far better reception from this radio. A mono radio, technically should have far better performance than a stereo one such as that used in your car (yet car radios are very well made) so maybe that is not a fair comparison.The Sony ICF38 may be the better choice. The Sony ICF-38 seems almost identical to this Panasonic (offering both battery and AC power) yet it has far better reviews.I ordered the Sony ICF10 and tested it side by side with this Panasonic. Now this Sony is battery operated only and costs about a third of the Panasonic. The Panasonic was  better in one important aspect: it played much louder! It also pulled in a few more FM stations. Now this is not an entirely fair test, given the difference in price but many reviews lead me to believe that ALL Sony portables were better. That is certainly NOT the case regarding Sony's ICF10. The Panasonic is much better regarding volume but only slightly better in reception.The Sony ICF-f38 is roughly comparable in price and offers both battery and AC operation. It is a model you should consider but candidly I'm tired of testing portable radios and I'll live with this Panasonic - its OK (at best) but years ago you could get far better for the same price. I wish I had the energy to test it against the Sony ICF38It is hard to recommend this radio but I'm too lazy to ship it back. This review is far from complete because I can only tell you the the very inexpensive Sony ICF-10 is even worse (hard to believe) and just possibly - the Sony ICF-38 MIGHT be better.The one take away from my review should be that this Panasonic is a mediocre radio","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8T5BCVDF2W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007KDX6#wasThisHelpful","RE8T5BCVDF2W3","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Knorr/Lipton side dishes. They are all easy to prepare, cook in about 6 minutes and all you will need is a pot with a cover.This Rice Pilaf is NOT some culinary delight, but the taste is certainly decent, some might say ""good"" and it is definitely both easy and quite quick to prepare.

"This product worked for me but I underwent a long and intensive regimen of in-hospital antibiotics for many months. My entire digestive system was out of order and the doctors were largely clueless about how to treat it.Then one fine physician ""prescribed"" this product. Within a few weeks I was returned to normal. I've since discontinued its use and I'm fine. But it made a huge difference within about a month and I credit this product for jump starting my digestive system where all other regimens had failed.While manufacturers of these products would like to suggest that this become a daily supplement - used day after day - month after month - year after year --- I strongly suspect that this type of product has a limited usage but that does not mean it is without merit. Far from it!I'm certainly not a doctor and there may be other circumstances/treatments you've undergone that have killed off the normal bacteria in your digestive tract. But I am of the opinion that for most people this is an expensive supplement that will likely produce no results unless your circumstances are a bit unique.At the same time, it produced dramatic improvements in my rather unique case and I only used it for a month and now, many months later, I'm doing just fine, without ever using it again.A simple suggestion: try it, at most, for two months. See if you get any results. Follow the instructions regarding dosage and be sure to store it at or BELOW 75 degrees (that is written on the product's label and in summer, even with air conditioning, you could exceed that temperature).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9J3XYM570G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006F8YJGM#wasThisHelpful","R3F9J3XYM570G7","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first piece of advice is to check the date of any review. Much has changed over the years! I'm writing this in March of 2013.This is a fine device and it works quite well. I recommend its purchase but everyone should be aware of the modest yet mandatory monthly fees. After you buy this device you MUST pay between $3.50 to $4.00 a month (that is the absolute minimum - actual cost varies by zip code) every month to OOMA. For that modest fee you'll get unlimited* free phone calls through out the USA, Caller-ID, 911 service, answering service, etc at this basic rate. OOMA's basic service is quite good and far from crippled.What is the OOMA Telo?A device that connects between your existing phones (wired or wireless or both) and the internet to make phone calls. Your computer does not even have to be on and no software is needed/used and/or supplied. To repeat myself, you only need an active high speed internet connection for this device to work. This is identical to what cable providers (such as Comcast, ATT Uverse, etc) offer in their TV/internet/phone packages. These cable providers also dump your phone calls onto the internet and then charge you $40 or $50 a month for just the telephone portion of your service. OOMA is also nearly identical to Vonage yet much cheaper too.Is OOMA free?NO (although it once was). Figure about $4.00 a month (it varies slightly by zip code) for unlimited* USA calls with caller ID, 911, answering service, etc with OOMA's ""basic"" service. Their ""premiere"" service, offers a number of very advanced features (see their website) and costs an additional $10.00 a month added to the previously mentioned $4.00 a month charge. So to be clear - the premiere service costs about $14.00 a month and OOMA's basic service costs about $4.00 a month. Keep in mind OOMA's basic service has a wide range of features so it is far from basic and/or useless. In fact, their ""basic"" service is exactly what I use. Thankfully - OOMA only offers two levels of service - basic and premiere so you can easily review the differences on their web siteWhat equipment/services does OOMA require?Simple - a ""high speed"" internet connection but OOMA does NOT require your internet connection be very fast. In fact, by todays standards, it can be incredibly slow. Interestingly, OOMA does not clearly specify a recommended internet speed but, given various forum posts, it seems that even a lowly speed of 1 MPS is more than adequate. So if you have any type of internet connection other than an old fashioned dial up connection, this device should work just fine. Your existing phones will also work just fine too. No actual phone is included with the device but it is easy to hook up your existing home wiring and existing phones via a single telephone cord plugged between the OOMA telo device and any telephone jack. That type of setup is identical to what cable providers or Vonage uses.Is OOMA a good deal?I'd say it is a GREAT DEAL but here are the figures. You pay a fairly hefty up front cost to purchase the OOMA Telo device (between $150 and $200) and then it will cost you about $4.00 or $14.00 a month for OOMA's services. Compare that to your monthly costs for internet based phone service from your cable provider. Within the first year you'll likely come out ahead and after the first year --- the savings really add up. OOMA is also considerably cheaper than Vonage which charges about $25.00 a month PLUS taxes and fees of about $9.00 to $13.00 for their unlimited* USA/Canadian calling plan. So Vonage really costs about $35.00 a month. However, Vonage does not charge for their equipment.  Yet you will still come out ahead with OOMA in the first year and keep saving considerably more thereafter.Voice Quality:It is generally excellent and since OOMA has put a lot of technology into this device I suspect it is not only as good as what you get from your cable provider but likely better. I did several test calls from my OOMA system, calling myself on another line (which was an actual, old fashioned, hard wired landline - the gold standard). Beyond a very slight delay, the voice quality was superb. BTW: I'm an electrical engineer. Yet nothing beats a hard wired, old fashioned, telephone connection.The Disadvantages:The only disadvantage I can see is it takes a (tiny) bit of effort to install the OOMA in comparison to just having a tech from your cable provider installing everything. OOMA has made this device very simple to install but some folks like everything to be done for them and here (obviously) the cable provider comes out ahead. Also to be fair - an elderly person or someone who is absolutely clueless might have some difficulty but OOMA has gone overboard in making it a very simple device to install. Yet, to be very clear, you have to know where your modem is and find a telephone jack near it and run the supplied cable. Then go to OOMAs web site and supply some simple information (like your name and address so 911 knows where to go) and a credit card number so they can bill you.Another problem for OOMA, Vonage, Cable providers, etc is you need electrical power to keep your phones working. Traditional, old fashioned telephone lines provide their own power that is sent over their wires. I can't tell you the number of times my home has lost power (I'm in a bad service area and we loose power at least 4 times a year but rarely more than 20 days total in a given year) but my traditonal landline phones always keep working. I use OOMA for a second line only. If you have good cell phone service this may not matter or if your electrical power is far more reliable it probably is not a concern. For the infirmed and those that need a lifeline - you want a battery backup or an old fahioned telephone line.Other Comments:I really like my OOMA telo unit but I resent OOMA's current advertising. This is NOT a one time purchase nor is ANY free service included except for the first 2 months!!! At minimum - figure about $4.00 a month after you spend between $150 and $200 for the device. Without paying at least $4.00 a month you will find you have purchased a useless device (meaning a ""brick"" - techno parlance - for an electronic device that is as useless as a brick)! Now $4.00 a month is not much but why advertise OOMA as free????? That strikes me as deceptive. Shame on you OOMA when you have produced such a fine device and such a reasonably priced telephone service.* Unlimited calling is NOT unlimited calling. OOMA says (in the fine print) that it includes up to 5,000 minutes per month and Vonage says (in even finer print - actually this was quite hard to find)  their ""unlimited"" plan includes up to 3000 minutes per month. Clearly both services want to discourage call centers and businesses from using their products. OOMA, on its web site says ""We have never terminated a customer that has used the service for residential purposes."" Vonage says their ""unlimited"" (actually a 3000 minute plan) suits 95% of its customers. I believe both of them. These minutes apply ONLY to out-going calls for OOMA. I'm uncertain about Vonage. I also suspect that cable companies have similar caps but I have not researched this.I would NOT RECOMMEND the OOMA HD2 handset. I tried it and then returned it. I recommend you just stick with your existing phones. This handset is not required and I preferred my existing cordless and wired phones. See my review of OOMA's HG2 handset, but be aware, there are some advantages to users that use OOMA's premiere services if they purchase this handset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36AT5TXAJ0EOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O3W4LE#wasThisHelpful","R36AT5TXAJ0EOH","A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those books that I call a digressionography. The idea is that the author starts with a single event, and then to flush out his story he follows every thread from the original story, adding a subplot repeatedly to the main one. This can be annoying, if the author lets the subplots take over the story to the point that you get confused about the main plot, but it works here because author Schechter doesn't let things get out of hand. The main plot is the murder trial of Roland Molineaux, the son of a minor Civil War General (try looking him up in a serious or even lengthy history of the war and see where you get) who was a prominent figure in the business community after the war, and very active in city politics and veterans' organizations for the next 50 years or so. Roland was a man-about-town and businessman who worked at a paint factory (the business his father was so successful in) and he was accused of poisoning someone accidentally, while intending to kill a man he really hated. The interesting thing about the case was that a *second* person had been poisoned to death earlier, and in that instance Molineaux had a more concrete motive: he was rivals with the guy for the hand of a young woman. The problem there was that the dead guy's attending physician insisted that his patient had died of diphtheria, and wouldn't change the cause of death on the death certificate even after testing was done on his organs and the presences of the poison conclusively proven. When Molineaux came to trial for the other killing, the prosecution was allowed to bring in all sorts of evidence relating to the earlier killing, and things got interesting as a result.I found this book to be interesting and reasonably well-constructed. It is a bit long, but this sort of book usually isn't short. I really enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDNX2UQQIKW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345476808#wasThisHelpful","R3MDNX2UQQIKW8","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm something of a C.J. Box fan. I like the cowboy-as-detective thing and I've been following Box since he only had 1-2 books in print. This current entry in the series is actually one of his better books. Sometimes authors who write series get into ruts, and the plots begin to repeat themselves. Here Box, when he revisits themes he's touched on before, has a fresh take on them, doesn't just rehash what he'd already done.In the current entry, Box's protagonist Joe Pickett learns that his middle, adopted daughter has been badly injured, apparently attacked by someone, and left by the side of the road for dead. Pickett immediately suspects her no-account boyfriend, a rodeo champion who is a bit full of himself, and who Joe has never liked. However, the kid has an apparently unbreakable alibi: he was badly injured in a rodeo riding a bull, and has the injuries to prove it. Then a crazy survivalist is found to have some of the daughter's things in his trash, and before they can question him properly he kills himself.Meanwhile Nate Romanowski, a survivalist and falconer who's also Joe's best friend, has been released from prison. However, as soon as he's out he runs into trouble, and things go completely sideways from there. I won't tell you any more because it'll ruin the plot, but it's all quite interesting, fun, and suspenseful...Very good book and a good entry in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUE1OZ963DB7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG9O18#wasThisHelpful","RUE1OZ963DB7G","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled across this book at the LA Times Festival of Books, where I paid $10 for it...a steal considering it runs between $25-50 here on Amazon when I look. I'd never heard of Platt before, but I've been looking for some time for a book about the Taiping Rebellion, or Civil War, or whatever you wish to call it. Unfortunately this book is more a history of the Taipings' attempts to contact Europeans, and Britain's relations with both the Taipings and their Qing Dynasty rivals, than it is an actual history of the war itself. Oddly Platt does exactly the same thing that Jonathan Spence does in his ""God's Chinese Son"", he tells you there are lots of good books, doesn't specify any that are good general histories of the war, and then proceeds to tell you what his book *is* a history of. I just find this annoying.The book itself is quite interesting and thorough, and the author makes some interesting points. He missed one interesting coincidence though: the war was ended when the Qing soldiers exploded their mine under the walls of Nanjing and overran the city...and the Petersburg mine was exploded 11 days later. The latter was longer but much smaller, using maybe 20% of the explosives.Anyway, I thought it an interesting book and I learned a great deal about the Taipings. I just wish someone would recommend a general history to me, one that would be reasonably priced or accessible in the library, balanced and informative and not overly scholarly (though I can do that if I have to).Good book though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4S7O42ZUJ31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEKQRSW#wasThisHelpful","RD4S7O42ZUJ31","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm probably the biggest fan of ""The Killer Angels"" I know of. I have reread it several times, and I don't reread novels, and I certainly don't reread them more than once. However, his son has essentially taken his dad's best-known work and turned it into a cottage industry. ""The Killer Angels"" is considered pretty influential even in a historical sense (it's led some historians to rethink James Longstreet's reputation, for instance, and prior to the book only specialists had ever heard of John Buford or Lawrence Chamberlain) but son Jeff's work is much more workmanlike, a novelistic retelling of events from the perspective of the participants. This is interesting, and it's pretty well-done here...it's just not quite the father's original work.The siege of Vicksburg is one of the pivotal moments of the Civil War, yet few know anything about it. Grant so outmaneuvered his opponent, John Pemberton, that he managed to pen his army up in the fortress city of Vicksburg, after defeating it at the battle of Champion Hill. The surrender of the Confederate army in Vicksburg on July 4 1863 (the day after the end of the fighting at Gettysburg) was the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. They were cut off from the states on the other side of the Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, and for the rest of the war this major waterway was completely under the control of the Union forces. Though paroled, the army disintegrated and mostly never returned to the ranks, regardless of parole, draft, or anything else. Grant of course went on to win the war and become President.This is a reasonable book if you're not that knowledgeable about Civil War history, and you want to read fiction rather than a historical account of the campaign.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R48Q3YBB4JHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345527399#wasThisHelpful","R1R48Q3YBB4JHL","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is pretty much a precursor to Alan Furst's more recent espionage novels set during World War II. The plot revolves around an English engineer who can't find work in his own country, and so takes work in Italy. There, he services and maintains shell-loading machines that have been sold by an English company to various factories in Italy, but of course the production of artillery shells in Italy in 1938 is of considerable importance to other countries, and so eventually he's approached by 2 different spies, who bribe him and threaten him to get him to keep them informed.

"This is your typical War memoir from a Soviet soldier. They tend to be long on anecdote and short on things like specifics of where units were, who they were fighting (beyond ""Germans"" or even ""Hitlerites"") and are often characterized by wooden prose. I think this latter at least in part stems from the translation from Russian into English. Regardless, this book recounts the adventures of an artillery officer who served on the Eastern Front for 3 years, being wounded 3 times in the process. He started out fighting in the Rhzev salient, then his division was reassigned to the southern front and fought through the Ukraine and southern Europe, winding up in Austria and Czechoslovakia. He started out commanding a battery, at one point commanded the artillery battalion's unit of spotters, and eventually commanded the battalion itself. The book is interesting in that the author displays a good deal of disdain for those who shied away from the front. He actually threw one of his battery commanders out of the unit and told him to not come back, even though the guy had connections somewhere in headquarters, or so he says. It's interesting.Recommended for those interested in the topic. Not exactly a classic war memoir though, too esoteric and not well enough written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386FNPV8LHZ6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811709086#wasThisHelpful","R386FNPV8LHZ6L","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shiloh is one of those battles that's been somewhat neglected, in terms of historical studies. Gettysburg, by contrast, has been written about a great deal. In part I think this can be attributed to the fact that the Yankees won, and the Confederates don't have any real significant heroes present at the battle, at least in senior positions. Albert Sidney Johnston, the senior Confederate General, was killed at the battle and as a result doesn't generate too much interest. His chief subordinate, P.G.T. Beauregard, is generally regarded unsympathetically, because he wasn't much of a general for most of the war. Anyway, regardless of the reason, there are only 2-3 decent studies of the battle, the best probably being Shiloh: Bloody April by Wiley Sword and Shiloh: In Hell before Night by James Lee McDonough. This current book is much newer, and Daniel uses sources and materials not available to the other authors. He also spends a lot more time trying to fit the battle into the context of the campaign and the War, and dismantling or debunking the various stories and anecdotes surrounding the battle. The result is quite entertaining, and frankly there's a lot of material here that's definitely worth the purchase price, if you're any sort of Civil War buff. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DP17QBZ2QEVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003719FVO#wasThisHelpful","R3DP17QBZ2QEVU","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never read any books by this author before, and I'd wondered if I was missing out on something. I picked the current book up at a library book sale, and I'm glad I only gave them a buck for it. It's entertaining, but frankly the most fun is that it's unintentionally laughable at times, enough to make me break out in peals of laughter on occasion.The main character is Alexander Hawke, an English nobleman. He's essentially a British version of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt with a bit of Lord Peter Wimsey thrown in for good measure, though frankly the combination makes him sound much more believable than he is when you read the book. He's an international plutocrat, filthy rich, ex-Royal Navy Tomcat pilot and SBS frogman, and of course a descendant of a pirate who was executed for his crimes, and who left a vast treasure buried somewhere, complete with X-marks-the-spot map for Alex and his friends to follow. He has a yacht that a Bond villain would think over-the-top, with a crew of who knows how many butlers and waiters and crewmen, who can double as instant commandos and policemen when needed, and there's a hanger in back with a seaplane, several vintage sports cars, a couple of motorcycles, and a ridiculously fast speedboat all hidden inside. He has a sonar array on the yacht he uses to track Russian subs, and the crew can do everything from mount a tailhook on the seaplane (so he can land it on the deck of an aircraft carrier) to mount a .50 cal. machinegun on the speedboat.He cruises around the world in his yacht and plane, meeting people, dodging bullets and bombs, flirting with beautiful women (one of whom is the Secretary of State) and drinking lots of expensive liquor. There are numerous bad guys for him to defeat, and he does so in predictable fashion, though I will admit the author keeps the plot rolling along. At times the author's understanding of military technology is a bit lacking (you don't fire an air-to-air missile at a ground target; it won't hit it, and if it did it wouldn't have much effect) and the plot and dialog are very predictable. The characters are all stereotypes out of comic books, to the point that one minor character, a French commando, has an accent that makes it sound like he learned English from Pepe Le Pew. It's actually funny at times, and rather enjoyable, if you can just put aside how silly the whole thing is and enjoy it. At least the author keeps things moving.I think if I ever buy another book in the series it'll be the same way: at a library or garage sale, where I'm not investing anything other than time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WL2V4M60L22R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416537783#wasThisHelpful","R1WL2V4M60L22R","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm somewhat interested in the subject of criminal and terrorist acts in a historical context, and this book, describing one of the central acts of terror of the Gilded Age, the bombing of Wall Street in 1920, is right in the center of that. The difficulty for me is that the author did too much contextualizing for my taste, and didn't spend enough time on the investigation itself. While she's a decent writer she's nothing spectacular, and as a result the narrative sort of plods along.

"I have a pet peeve about books. They should tell you what they're about, and be honest about it. This otherwise fine book is somewhat deceptive on the front cover, in that it promises to be a history of Naval Warfare during the era of Napoleon, while in reality it's a history of the Royal Navy during the period. This is perfectly fine, provided you tell people that, but the book's cover doesn't say that, and it's not until you read it that you realize. There's nothing, for instance, about America's Quasi-War with France, or the conflict with the Barbary Pirates. These were important conflicts during the era that involved the United States, and the book ignores them.Instead the book focuses on the British war effort, especially against Napoleon. This is well-handled, detailed and intelligent. The authors recognize that the period of fighting (1798-1805) shouldn't be overshadowed by the later campaign, and there's a detailed account of the fighting at Walcheren Island in 1809 for instance. The treatment of the United States during the conflict we call the War of 1812 is reasonably good if a bit incomplete, and certainly fair to the Americans, but again things are left out.Over all I liked this book, but there were gaps where the authors didn't live up to the cover of their book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SB9MSQ93FDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143113925#wasThisHelpful","R34SB9MSQ93FDT","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a number of Alan Furst's novels, and all of Philip Kerr's historical ""mysteries"" so I was intrigued by this book, which gets recommended on Amazon for those who like those other authors. Zoo Station is the first in a series of books featuring John Russell, who in this episode is a journalist working freelance in Berlin before the war. He's British, but speaks German fluently. He has a German girlfriend, and a number of characters with whom he works. As this book progresses, he signs on (in some cases voluntarily, some not) to spy for various countries (USSR, UK, Germany) all of whom seem to know vaguely about each other paying him, and not care. As time goes on the book is more and more complex and involved, and pretty suspenseful.I generally enjoyed this book, and will look for the next entry in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLWMUWZCATB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953489#wasThisHelpful","R1XLWMUWZCATB5","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reading Alan Furst's historical spy novels for some time now. He's very reminiscent of Philip Kerr, with the exception that Furst's novels aren't a series; each one stands alone, and typically the plot covers several years. In this episode, we follow the exploits of a decorated and wounded (in World War I) French cavalryman who's stationed as a military attaché at the Warsaw embassy. Of course much of his job is really spying on the Germans, trying to discover their intentions and targets, get military secrets, that sort of thing. He also has to deal with a number of other issues, involving everything from a vengeful Nazi intelligence official he humiliates to various liaisons he's either participating in or has arranged. The characters are well-drawn and inventive, and the action is a little better than typical in a Furst novel. I generally enjoyed this book a great deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQ0FNKUNPMNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812977378#wasThisHelpful","RTQ0FNKUNPMNZ","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a previous edition of this book, and I enjoyed it a great deal. The Civil War was a bloody affair, and the fighting wasn't confined to large battles on dramatic occasions. A lot of the fighting occurred in small fights and skirmishes, and this is the setting and basis for this book recounting the exploits of a fictional character who's a sergeant in a black cavalry regiment stationed in Northern Mississippi during the latter part of the war. The author makes almost no attempt to explain the historical situation to you, instead just sticking with the pro- and anti-slavery arguments, and he spends much of the book following various people. Some are Union and some are Confederate, both genders, and he makes a serious effort to not just portray the Confederates as evil Rebel slave owners. The effort is largely successful, and so is the book. The main character is rather lucky in that he rides through all these battles without ever getting seriously wounded, but real-life soldiers have done this also, and other than that quibble, the book is essentially flawless. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUEK9BNZQA8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0595398561#wasThisHelpful","RZUEK9BNZQA8S","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those books that steams along at full throttle, with you hurtling towards the end...and then there's sort of a whimper and it's over, and you're feeling a bit let down. The plot--an insurance investigator who's a disgraced arson investigator investigating a fire--is interesting and pretty conventional, but Winslow's choppy writing style makes it quite fun and a very quick read.

"This is one odd book. It's quite informative and interesting, but it's written in the first person, as if Sgt. Basilone was speaking to you directly. Since he was killed on Iwo Jima in 1945, this is obviously impossible, so the authors have attempted to channel him and recount his thoughts and motivations. Jerry Cutter, the coauthor, is the Sgt.'s nephew, but he was a year or 2 old when Basilone was killed on Iwo, so he never knew the subject of this book. Other relatives (notably a brother and a sister) authorized this book, so it must have something going for it, but it just felt odd to me, given that the guy's gone, and we can't really know exactly what he was thinking in a particular case.

The authors are incredibly varied, and all of them are participants in the debates surrounding the latter stages of the ratification of the United States Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Patrick Henry, etc. debate with various other characters who aren't familiar much to modern readers: James Iredell, Melancton Smith, and so forth.

"I think I'm a Stephen Carter fan. I read his first book, which was largely a memoir, when it came out in paperback, and I've read or at least have several of his other non-fiction books. He makes good points and discusses the issues that interest him intelligently and clearly, and he's a very good writer. When he turned to fiction, his characters are nuanced and intelligent, and the books he writes are fascinating, cerebral suspense stories, for the most part. For the most part, his protagonists are blacks with privileged backgrounds and names like Lemaster Carlyle. They're academics and white-collar professionals, typically from the Northeast somewhere, who summer on Martha's Vineyard and have prominent jobs, and families who have managed to be wealthy for generations, in spite of Jim Crow and co.The current book takes place in the late 1860s, but in an alternative universe. In this world, Booth shot Lincoln but didn't kill him, while George Atzerod was more successful as an assassin and managed to kill Andrew Johnson, the Vice President. Secretary Seward's assassin didn't kill him, but the wounds were much more serious than they were in fact, and so he's bedridden, and invalid and a shut-in. Mary Lincoln was killed the next year, falling into a lake while visiting family in Illinois, with a strong hint that it might have been suicide.As a result, Lincoln is somewhat weakened from the shrewd political operator all history buffs are by now familiar with. The main protagonist of the story is a young black woman, from one of those ""old money"" black families I told you about earlier, and she is working as the clerk in a law office which has been hired to defend the President during his impeachment trial. As the trial progresses, she's able to slowly have some influence on the trial and its outcome, largely because she wants to be one of the first black lawyers, and the first woman of any color to practice law.This is a wonderfully drawn book, complete with fictional portraits of several leading historical figures of the day. Thaddeus Stevens, Daniel Sickles, Kate Chase Sprague, Lincoln himself, wander in and out of the pages and are very well-done. The story is interesting, though I found the ending a bit of a letdown. Nevertheless, getting to the ending is quite wonderful and well worth reading the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JZVOF8K18ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307474488#wasThisHelpful","R27JZVOF8K18ED","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The publicity on this page says that this book is intended for the general reader. I semi-believe that, but I also believe, from the way it's constructed and the way the facts are laid out, that it's at least partially intended to be a textbook for a college-level course discussing the history of warfare. Either way, the authors do a good job laying out the outlines of the more violent portion of world history.The book begins with an interesting outline of ancient history, and works its way through the ages up to after the Cold war, stopping just at the end of the 20th Century. Brief mention is made of the World Trade Center attacks in 2001 right at the end. The focus of the book necessarily has to be very wide, so the authors insert ""case studies"" in which an incident, battle, campaign, or war from the era can be examined in brief detail, giving you some idea of how conflicts worked during the era. Of course given that the authors are trying to cram several thousand years of conflict and hundreds of wars into 600 pages, it's no wonder that even with the case studies, the focus is still very broad, and many important incidents and battles are skimmed over if not just left out of the narrative.The writing is very clear and insightful, and the overall effect of the book is quite interesting.

"I'm a fan of murder mysteries, and I liked the author's first book in the series, ""The Yard"". This second book follows the two partners, now firmly established as the investigator and his sidekick, as they investigate a suspicious disappearance and a curious discovery, that of an eyeball in a bird's nest. The setting is the countryside in England's coal country, where a particular village has been undermined by the mines to the point that houses simply disappear into the ground occasionally. I thought this part of the story a bit overdrawn, perhaps a remnant of the author's background as a graphic novelist, but the overall setting is interesting and the characters fascinating if a bit overdrawn. As is often the case the plot is secondary to the characters, setting, and atmosphere, all of which are fun if as I said dark.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECYHMA96IS89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425267733#wasThisHelpful","R1ECYHMA96IS89","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The theme is naval warfare, and the time period is from the Spanish-American War and the last part of the 20th century. Of course since then there hasn't been much naval warfare; frankly the parts of the book after the World War II section are pretty mundane as it is. The editor is a guy whose main claim to fame, in terms of naval history, is the rediscovery of Hector Bywater, the guy who sort of predicted the Pacific War in a book he wrote in the mid-30s.

"By now we've come to know John Ray Horn pretty well. He was a B-movie cowboy star back in the '30s, screwed up his career by punching the studio head's son in the face, and served in World War II, reaching his breaking point in combat and spending some time in a psych ward. The books are set in the early '50s, when the McCarthy era was just taking off, and the author sets the plot of this story around an accusation that one screenwriter was a communist, When that guy gets killed, Horn feels obligated to investigate and figure out what happened, largely because he feels bad about the individual in question getting accused and never getting the chance to defend himself.I'm always a bit leery about books with political messages, regardless of whether I agree with them or not, and this one was no exception. For one thing the issue is usually drawn in black and white, when of course in the real world there are often shades of gray. I'll agree that McCarthy was a piece of work (I've often played with the idea that he actually was a Soviet agent; he sure gave anti-Communism a bad name for a good long while) but that doesn't mean that there weren't communists trying to overthrow our country: it just means he accused the wrong people.Anyway, as I climb down off my soapbox I'll just tell you it's a pretty good mystery, and I think it's a shame the author has apparently decided not to write any more Horn books, at least for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVSO1HX7HTOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752878190#wasThisHelpful","R3GVSO1HX7HTOM","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eric Jaffe is a journalist, a writer and editor. His grandfather served in World War II as the division psychiatrist of a unit that briefly saw combat in the last days of the war, in Europe, and then performed occupation duty in Japan. While he was in Japan he was tapped to evaluate one of the Japanese defendants at the Tokyo war crimes trial, in terms of whether he was mentally capable of assisting his defense during the trial. The elder Jaffe decided that Okawa Shumei was incompetent to stand trial, and ever since it’s been assumed by many people that Okawa fooled everyone, including the psychiatrist, and got off scott free as a result.This book is a dual narrative. In alternating chapters author Jaffe chronicles the life of his grandfather, Daniel Jaffe, and Okawa Shumei. Daniel Jaffe lived on Long Island, growing up with his father, siblings, and mother (the author’s great-grandmother) who was institutionalized for much of her adult life. She actually killed an infant child (by dropping him out her window 3 stories up) early in her marriage, and clearly couldn’t be left without supervision, especially not with her children. Author Jaffe discusses his upbringing and the state of psychiatry in America at the time, while also covering everything from family life on Long Island in the interwar period to the fact that more foreign immigrants wound up in mental hospitals than did natives. The chapters discussing these topics alternate with chapters discussing Okawa, who spent much of his adult life as a lecturer and editorialist who argued for expansionist political policies for Japan.  Okawa’s a fascinating character, as is the Japanese expansionist political impulse of the 30s. Most of the instigators of this policy are at best obscure outside Japan, because no one individual was essential to the movement, and no one seemed to stand out. It’s interesting to read about, and in response to this book I looked in my own library in several books, seeking Okawa’s name in other indexes. It doesn’t occur at all.I found this book interesting, though the ending is a bit anti-climactic. I’d recommend it to anyone interested in psychiatry or World War II.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJM9Z683HEA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451612052#wasThisHelpful","RYJM9Z683HEA3","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the day I used to pay more attention to various detective novelists. I read a bunch more books back then, especially lighter fiction. Rex Burns was one of the writers I followed pretty closely. His main character was a Denver cop named Gabe Wager. They weren’t my favorite books but they were good enough for me to follow for a good long while. At some point the store where I bought murder mysteries closed, and my tastes shifted from them to more non-fiction. Somehow I lost track of Rex Burns in the shuffle: nothing intentional, it just happened.Now I’m reviewing stuff on NetGalley, and Rex Burns shows up with a new book. Now, instead of chronicling the adventures of Wager, Burns has developed a new pair of characters. They’re a father and daughter, and they’re both private eyes who work in Denver. Since I was familiar with Burns from back before, I decided to try out this latest book and see what I thought. My reaction is more or less so-so.The detectives, father and daughter, are OK, though I didn’t think their characters were that well-defined. We learn that the father is in ridiculously good shape, in that he can qualify to be a pro wrestler (in a small regional circuit) without having to get into shape. The father used to be a lawyer, but screwed up a particular contract negotiation so badly he decided that he should find another line of work. The guy who lost his shirt because of our hero’s incompetence as a lawyer hires him again, this time as a private eye, to protect him. He claims he already knows the source of the threat. He’s now a professional wrestling promoter wannabe, and the guy who runs the regional circuit locally apparently doesn’t want any competition. The Touchstone Agency (that’s their name) investigates, and soon discovers that the promoter who’s supposedly the source of the threats has mob connections from back east, and might easily be able to arrange what’s happening.This was only a so-so book, as I stated above. Some of the characters seemed a bit over the top, some of the dialog wasn’t that good, and as I said the characters weren’t that well-drawn. Wager himself makes a cameo appearance, and frankly I was more amused when he was around than I was with either of the protagonists. Not horrible, not that good either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS48G5GXO0414/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480445703#wasThisHelpful","RS48G5GXO0414","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what I consider a very interesting book. The author recounts the main event of the book--a collision of 2 ships in Halifax harbor in December 1917, one of them carrying explosives. The explosives-laden ship caught fire as a result of the collision, and then the explosions occurred. Many residents of the city were watching what amounted to a free accidental fireworks display when the ship exploded again, in what is generally thought to be the largest non-nuclear explosion in history. It flattened the city of Halifax (every building in town suffered some damage) and killed more than 3,000 people. In some instances, victims of the explosion were thrown more than a mile, and landed with barely a scratch, wondering how they got where they were. There was a subsequent tsunami that swept ships onto shore and caused more havoc, and that evening a blizzard hit and cut the ravaged and wounded city off from the outside world for a day or 2.The author recounts all of this with considerable aplomb and a sure hand, but what's fascinating is the other stuff that she comes up with. It turns out that the doctor who founded the first pediatric medical unit in an American hospital (in Boston) learned how to treat children who were seriously injured by implementing theories he'd never been able to invoke in America, and since they worked (non of the Canadian children under his care died, considered at that time a miracle) he went on to be essentially the father of modern pediatric medicine. Similarly an eye surgeon who worked long hours in Halifax (a lot of people were watching the fire from indoors, through windows, and when those windows blew in they suffered eye injuries) learned a great deal about his craft also. You even learn about the Christmas tree that the city of Halifax sends to Boston every year.I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHJ2ZZUAJH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802714587#wasThisHelpful","R1EHJ2ZZUAJH4","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this book up on a whim at a used bookstore after reading the blurb. The protagonist is essentially a younger version of the author, near as I can tell. Said protagonist is a financial journalist who lives in Hong Kong, though he's an American citizen. He's asked by a colleague, a Brit, to try and help his brother extricate himself from a pickle he's gotten himself into: he's fallen in love with a Russian prostitute who works in a brothel in Macau. For those who don't know, Macau was a Portuguese territory across the harbor from Macau, tiny by comparison, and the whole of it was mostly taken up with hotel-casinos, which were pretty much the only thing in the city that took in money. Since the book takes place in 1995 (which the author mentions almost casually about 100 pages into the book) the city's still a few years away from Chinese rule. Anyway, Ray Sharp agrees to try and help his colleague's brother, and journeys to Macau, where things get off the rails in a hurry.Essentially, Sharp gets told in no uncertain terms that he shouldn't interfere with a Russian hooker's pimp. *All* the pimps are homicidal and unstable, and the one who owns this girl is the worst of the lot. Though it takes a while to get going, once the action begins the story really moves along. Sharp's more of an observer than an actor for much of the story, but it's still interesting and suspenseful.I docked it one star because the backstory first third of the book took too long to get where it was going, or so I thought, and I was a bit annoyed by how passive the main character was at least at the beginning. That being said, I enjoyed the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3Z0DKZYD9IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932557482#wasThisHelpful","RR3Z0DKZYD9IB","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"J. Robert Janes has been working on this series for some time now. The premise of the whole thing is pretty odd: during World War II, while the Germans occupy France, a French homicide detective, Jean-Louis St-Cyr, is partnered with a Gestapo agent who's really a Bavarian homicide detective named Hermann Kohler. Despite their opposing nationalities, they work together to solve murders in Paris, and various parts of France to which they are sent. In the current episode, they've been sent to Elsass (Alsace) to solve a pair of suspected murders, which look very convincing as suicides. Given the coincidence of them happening so close together, however, the authorities have sent for these 2 detectives, in the hope that they can investigate and figure out what's going on.The dead are involved with 2 different establishments in the area, one a textile plant that makes synthetic material for the German army, the other one of the early concentration camps, where political prisoners and some Jews are incarcerated. Kohler and St-Cyr have to navigate both these institutions at least somewhat to figure out why the revival of a local Carnival caused the deaths of these 2 people, and how. By the end of the book it's pretty obvious who the perpetrator(s) is/are, but getting there is fun, if a bit convoluted.It's not Janes' best book, but if you're following the series you won't want to miss it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F39HAXBOSJCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JL1CHZK#wasThisHelpful","R3F39HAXBOSJCP","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those compilation books that contains a bunch of ""stories,"" typically running to a page or two, in this case all involving World War II. Many of them have appeared elsewhere, so some are probably familiar to the average person who reads about World War II, but I seriously doubt much of anyone has read all of these books. I certainly hadn't. It results in the sort of book you keep next to your toilet, or give to a 12-year-old who's just starting to express an interest in history.

"David Liss now has a reputation, with me. He writes these historical thrillers, somewhere between spy novels and murder mysteries, where his main character(s) are caught up in government misdeeds and conspiracies, and must attempt to thwart evil forces who hold all the financial cards. In this book, the third entry in the Benjamin Weaver series, the boxer-turned-thieftaker must figure out a way out of the hold on shadowy figure has on him, while also trying to thwart that man's enemies. The Company of the title is the East India Company, which essentially had a monopoly on trade with India during the early 1800's (when the story takes place) and of course with a monopoly there's ample opportunity for corruption and favoritism. Weaver must navigate through it all, taking care not to make a misstep...This is a reasonably good book, given that you accept the premise involved. At times it's probably over-done in terms of the conspiracy aspect, and the author seems fascinated by insider trading and market manipulation, which is sometimes tedious enough that I doubt more than a few readers are following. However, the author does a good job with his characters, and that's the saving grace of the book.Guardedly recommended. It's good, though a bit complicated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZZ1274NRO05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DBIOFC#wasThisHelpful","R37ZZ1274NRO05","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a biography of Melvin Purvis written by his surviving son, an art teacher in Boston. Melvin Purvis was of course the most famous member of the FBI for much of the mid-30s, and it's generally conceded that J. Edgar Hoover hounded him out of the FBI and kept him from obtaining decent employment after, mostly because he was jealous of Purvis's fame. Purvis of course was the guy who led the teams that killed Dillinger and ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, and Hoover felt that modern ""scientific"" practices should have gotten the credit (even though they had little or no impact on the investigations).This book works pretty well as a discussion of crime-fighting techniques in the '30s, when the cops were just learning how to do actual detective work. It reads quite well and is interesting. I'd recommend it if you're at all interested in true crime and/or historical stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GFPTIUV2YRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026SCNOK#wasThisHelpful","R16GFPTIUV2YRO","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been following Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series all the way back to when he'd written the trilogy called *Berlin Noir*. Kerr resumed writing the series after 20 years or so, saying he'd always intended to revisit it but other things kept getting in the way. Since then he's been running back and forth along the timeline of Gunther's life, showing us episodes involving mobsters in postwar Cuba and pimps and prostitutes in Berlin in the '30s. Occasionally he's at least provided a scene involving the war itself, and this current book is the 3nd one, from my memory, that takes place mostly or completely during the war. In this episode, Bernie works for a unit of the Gestapo that investigates war crimes. Yes, it sounds silly, but the Nazis actually did this sort of thing, trying to exonerate themselves and at the same time implicate the Allies (primarily the Soviets) in atrocities that the Nazi authorities thought would help them with world opinion. Generally this sort of thing didn't have much effect on what happened, but in this particular instance, the Soviets were guilty as hell: they murdered thousands of Polish army officers after overrunning eastern Poland. This is generally undisputed now, but back in Bernie's day it was by no means a fact, more of a guess.So Bernie goes to the Ukraine in early 1943. The 6th Army has just surrendered at Stalingrad and morale is low everywhere. People are asking what will happen if the Soviets win the war, and those Ukrainians who collaborated with Hitler are getting nervous. There are other deaths that have happened more recently of course, and Bernie's skills as an investigator are called on, to sort out what's going on.This is a good book.

"I've reviewed a number of books for NetGalley now, and this is probably the worst one that I've actually finished. It's not a terrible book, reads pretty quickly, and has a plot with some twists and turns. A number of people were turned off by the profanity (really?) and what they considered gratuitous sex (it doesn't offend me, I just find it annoying) and violence (always fun).The premise at the beginning of the book is rather far-fetched. The protagonist is a female FBI agent who came to the States after being a police officer in China. The backstory at the beginning makes it sound as if she just showed up one day and the FBI gave her a job. Her FBI partner thinks she needs to learn to drive (isn't it a requirement with FBI agents? Wouldn't he know that?) and for whatever reason they get pulled away from regular duty in the San Francisco Bay area and sent to Detroit to try and figure out why a serial killer, who everyone thought had been caught  8 years ago, has resurfaced (or is there a copycat?). There's a lot of plot and action in this book, and thankfully it moves along at a decent pace. You have to wonder why the local detectives couldn't follow the leads that Abby finds, but the whole plot is more or less unbelievable, so that doesn't stand out. Bodies fall everywhere, seemingly once every 20 pages or so, and the characters don't always act in a logical fashion.In the author's defense though I will repeat one thing: it read fast and was reasonably well-written. I don't mean spelling and punctuation, but the sentences weren't unreadable and the plot more or less made sense. As I said, worst book I've read to the finish through NetGalley, but I *did* finish.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241P9MWNLLG6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UH3Q6Y#wasThisHelpful","R241P9MWNLLG6A","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't always a Doris Kearns Goodwin fan. Back in the day I saw an interview with her, where she ripped the first volume of Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson. Her argument seemed weak (she seemed to think that since Johnson was in her mind a ""great"" President, his flaws should be overlooked) and she seemed very biased about Johnson. Later, she got caught up in one of those plagiarism scandals that plague historians intermittently, when one of their researchers writes a passage for the historian's book, and essentially lifts it from the work of another, less-well-known author. So I was deliberately avoiding her, but somehow finally got my arm twisted hard enough to read Team of Rivals, and found it quite good. When this book came out I decided I needed to read it, especially Roosevelt and Taft are two of my favorite presidents.The first part of the book is essentially a dual biography of the two men and their wives. Roosevelt of course has been written about extensively, with Edmund Morris having just concluded is three-volume biography, and many other books having been written over the years. Taft has been the subject of many fewer books, so it was here I expected Goodwin to shine, and she does come through in a big way, filling in the gaps in our knowledge of Taft and rounding out his character a great deal.If she'd chosen to write simply a dual biography, I suspect I'd be giving the book 5 stars, but she chose to digress in the middle of the book, and examine the beginnings of investigative journalism, as seen through the rise of McClure's Magazine during this era. This is an interesting subject, and I expect if the author had wanted to she could have produced a 400-page book on this subject also, but instead she chose to fold it into this book about Roosevelt and Taft. The result is the thing that often turns me off to a dual biography: when the author's writing about subject ""X"", you wish they would write about subject ""Y"", and vice versa. Here, the dual biography aspect worked pretty well, but the grafting of the McClure's subject onto the rest of the book seemed very awkward to me.In addition, just to make things more annoying, Goodwin essentially ends the book with the 1912 Presidential election. Once Taft is defeated and Wilson enters the White House, there's only a few more pages. Taft's decade as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court gets less than a full page, and there's almost no mention of what happened to the journalists she was following in the McClure's thread.In short, if she'd fleshed out her material a bit more, I think she'd have had 2 books here, and they both would have been excellent. Instead she tried to graft one onto the other, and it only partially worked. The book is still well-written and interesting, but it could have been more than it was, at least in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVE6H0MOHB1DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141654786X#wasThisHelpful","RVE6H0MOHB1DQ","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those books that you're supposed to put next to your toilet, so you can read while you're doing your business. It's about 500 pages of stuff, mostly on the U.S. military, and it contains a lot of trivia. The pieces tend to be short (1-5 pages) and to the point, with an eye for humor here and there. They're also very patriotic, so there are no accounts of atrocities or anything like that. That's fine with me (it's not like this is going to be my sole resource on the American Army, after all) and the writing is pretty good.

"James Lee Burke has been putting out these books for decades now, and I've become a pretty big fan over the years. I read most every one as it comes out, and enjoy them a great deal. The protagonist, Dave Robichaux, is a wonderful character, beaten and partially broken but unwilling to give in that last little bit; he's also utterly devoted to his former partner and good friend Clete Purcell, who's a force of nature and more than a bit out of control. The result, when both men begin to look for young women whom they believe are in trouble, is a sort of kaleidoscope of violence, confusion, conversation, and suspense that's frankly amazing at times, though at this point it's also a bit predictable.I did enjoy this book though, and will continue to read the series in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDORBGNYFDOT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451648146#wasThisHelpful","RDORBGNYFDOT3","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very improbable and badly-plotted ""suspense"" novel written by the lady who does the Stephanie Plum books, and some Hollywood guy. The result is a bad pastiche of the old TV series ""It Takes a Thief"" with the Malachi Throne character replaced by a sexy female Navy Seal turned FBI agent. Old bald guys don't get into stuff like this anymore, much. Our heroes are a super-sexy con man and thief and the abovementioned FBI agent, who at one time was tasked with catching him. Somehow he's had his arm twisted into stealing things for the FBI (you wouldn't think they'd have much use for that) and of course he and the FBI-gal have a ""spark of sexual tension"" that keeps intruding into the ridiculous plot.The whole thing is so relentlessly cute it's enough to almost make you gag. Added to that, the bad guy in this entry is a combination of Karl Rove and Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, but unlike Austin Powers this isn't written with the same tongue in cheek wink at the audience humor. Instead we're supposed to buy this guy as a mega-mogul, summoning an Apache attack helicopter to blow a village in Scotland to pieces, then summoning drones to attack his enemies with rockets outside his home somewhere in the states.

"If you've never read one of John Mortimer's Rumpole stories, then you're missing out on something. The author produced a bunch of these short stories, which were more or less a British cross between Law & Order and Monty Python. Rumpole himself is an ancient lawyer, always defending people and always taking the poorest clients, who barely finance his middle-class, middle-brow lifestyle. He rereads one book of collected poetry constantly, along with legal tomes, always drinks cheap wine in a dreary ""wine bar"" across the street from the courthouse, and has little time for vacations, what with the work load being so heavy. His ""chambers"" are full of amusing characters, who one after the other get themselves into and out of predicaments, often with Rumpole's assistance in one direction or the other.

"Let me start out by saying that I got this novel from NetGalley thinking it was a war novel. When I actually looked at what I'd gotten it was obvious it wasn't: it's a romance novel set in Italy during World War II. The author doesn't engage in any of the typical silliness with war novels, turning the heroines into commandos or spies or whatever. The women are what women were, in wartime in that era: nurses, office-workers, refugees, perhaps code-breakers.The story centers around three men who are officers in the British Army, and the women with whom they get involved. The plot is the fairly typical star-crossed lovers variety, with one of the soldiers falling for the other's fiancée, and the whole thing having to sort itself out. It does, and in a reasonably realistic, if not particularly surprising fashion.Though this is a romance, the author did include battle sequences, and they're pretty well-done. I noted a few mistakes, but only a very few, and overall I thought those parts of the book quite good.Recommended, especially if you like romance novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6A8XEVZS0T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELGECPI#wasThisHelpful","RA6A8XEVZS0T7","A2B1GZIRD6W646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B1GZIRD6W646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am always pleased to see books for the general reader that undertake to explain some facet of the Supreme Court, since the Court remains a mystery to many (much like the fourth or administrative branch of the federal government).  This book focuses upon one very important dimension of the Court, the philosophy of judicial restraint or deference to Congressional policy, and to contrast it with judicial activism.  The author is a Senior Editor at ""Reason"" magazine, an important voice for libertarians who value individual liberty above all, seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice.  Sometimes libertarians take positions identical with conservative; in other instances (as this book well illustrates) the two philosophies come into conflict.The author covers a wide range of issues as he dissects l(and rejects) judicial restraint as a controlling judicial principle. While I found the individual chapters to be solid, my concern is that they did not flow together smoothly in developing an argument. There is one area, I will mention later, where it all  does come together very well and where I believe the book makes a major contribution.The author begins with a general discussion on judicial restraint, basically targeting Justice Holmes as the major progenitor of the concept.  He also includes a good discussion of Justice Field, the genesis of the 14th amendment, and the much criticized ""Slaughterhouse"" decision in which the Court emasculated the ""privileges and immunities"" clause of the amendment. With this clause nullified, the Court was free to employ a judicial restraint viewpoint, which allowed government regulation to expand and individual liberty to contract (e.g., the ""Munn"" doctrine). While liberty of contract did have a brief run, the Progressive movement's emphasis on majority rule and regulation by experts prevailed until the Old Court battled the New Deal, where the ultimate victory of FDR over the Court led to the Court backtracking from questioning Congressional economic and social policy statutes. To do this it employed an undemanding ""rationale basis"" approach. Until fairly recently, the Court had not declared any such statutes unconstitutional--for the author an unhealthy development as regards safeguarding liberty.The author next devotes an interesting chapter to the late Judge Bork who favored judicial restraint, unless the Constitutional provided specific guidance on an issue to the contrary. This chapter serves as a preface to the most important topic the author discusses, the continuing battle between conservatives and libertarians. This is a masterful discussion of a topic too often overlooked. The author discusses and parses the views of Bernard Siegen, the 1984 Cato Institute conference here in Washington where Bork debated Richard Epstein (who advocated use of the 5th amendment's ""taking clause"" as a device to fight government over-regulation), and Justice Scalia's preference for judicial restraint. This battle continues today and the reader is equipped by this chapter to better grasp the important contrasting philosophies at issue.The remainder of the book looks at some actual cases, such as the Kelo eminent domain litigation, the second amendment gun rights case and the Obamacare decision.  Chief Justice Roberts raised the very point central to this book in the ACA litigation by in part basing his surprise vote upholding the law by stating an ""it is not our job"", pro judicial restraint argument. The book has extensive notes and a good select bibliography.  It would have been helpful had the author done more discussion of the libertarian philosophy and the vital role of the Cato Institute here in Washington in educating us about this approach. As I said above, the book could be better integrated in my opinion--but the individual chapters stand on their own as important contributions.  A book well worth reading by anyone interested in the Court and its role..","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3HWEFV6N39S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279230#wasThisHelpful","R2N3HWEFV6N39S","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in Georgetown, I was naturally interested when I heard about this book.  I assumed it was a light discussion of some of the goings-on involving prominent politicians and journalists who made Georgetown their home.  I could not have been more wrong.  Rather, the book, authored by a prominent University of California diplomatic historian, is a compelling history of Georgetowners who were involved in the Cold War, the founding of the C.I.A., the ""loss of China"", the McCarthy scare, the Marshall Plan, the Korean war, Vietnam, the missile gap, the New Frontier, the Cuban missile crisis, and Watergate to name some of the book's topics. The development of the ""containment"" policy, formulated by George Kennan, which largely shaped the Cold War, is also well dissected. The formative early stages of the C.I.A. are illuminated as well.The central figures throughout the book are Joseph Alsop (1910-89) and his brother Stewart (1914-74), two highly influential columnists when people actually still read newspapers. The book begins just after the end of World War II and roughly runs through to the breakup of the Soviet Union. Making appearances are Dean Acheson; Phil and Kay Graham of the Washington Post; Felix Frankfurter; George Kennan; Paul Nitze; Chip Bohlen; Averell Harriman; Susan Mary Alsop; Allen Dulles; Frank Wisner; John Paton Davies; Richard Helms; and JFK among others. The book is most perceptive in examining how the interaction between high-level government officials and their journalistic neighbors, living in the same compact Washington community, impact upon important government policies.  For example, Alsop's intimate interactions with the Nixon administration (including Henry Kissinger) during the Vietnam war are particularly well documented.By focusing upon the actors' key public and private interactions, the reader is afforded an invaluable insider perspective on each topic. However, as the author recounts in his Epilogue, Georgetown is no longer the center of the world no matter what some of my neighbors may believe.  We surely still have many high and low government officials and journalists in residence; Republicans are still concerned about the notorious Georgetown cocktail parties which they believe subvert good conservatives. But the era of political giants like Dean Acheson, George Kennan, Averell Harriman, and JFK residing in Georgetown, close by journalists such as the Alsops, Ben Bradlee, and the Washington Post's Grahams, is long gone--probably because their are so few giants these days in Washington.The book is some 472 pages including extensive notes and a helpful bibliography. One problem is that the book covers so many folks and topics that anybody under 50 or so may have a problem keeping them all straight.  I had this problem at points even though I am well above 50 and lived through this entire period.  One the other hand, I learned a lot about folks I did know about, like Phil Graham and his tragic suicide, and critically significant individuals like Frank Wisner who helped shape the CIA, whom I knew nothing about. The author is to be commended for his outstanding research--the book covers a lot of ground.  Anyone interested in this period of the ""American Century"" needs to read this fine book..","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GSUZZN3BXXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307271188#wasThisHelpful","R4GSUZZN3BXXR","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I was somewhat familiar with John Adams and especially Henry Adams, I was pretty unfamiliar with John Quincy Adams 1767-1848).  So, I was glad to read this extensive study by Fred Kaplan, which as is the current trend for bios, runs somewhat long at 622 pages. The book, however, has many more virtues than just being an extensive and comprehensive review of JQA's life. While the author focuses upon Adams, of course, he also pays attention to what else is going on around Adams, in order to establish the proper context. So, for example, we learn much about John and Abigail Adams and their activities and the development of partisan national politics.  Kaplan is also interested in more than the political Adams.  As an English professor, he discusses frequently Adams as a pamphleteer, poet, and diarist. I think to understand Adams the politician, it is essential to have some familiarity with the literary Adams as well.  JQA's extensive diary, maintained over most of his life, and heavily relied upon by the author, allows Adams to speak for himself in describing his motivations and views.  This is particularly important in understanding Adams' amazingly expansive diplomatic and political career before he became the sixth President., as well as his eventual hostility to Jefferson.The bio follows a conventional chronological format. I was surprised to see how extensive a career Adams had had before the Presidency: expansive diplomatic experience at the highest levels throughout Europe (including negotiating the Jay treaty and the Treaty of Ghent); an early term in the Senate; a nomination to the Supreme Court by Madison which was foreclosed by his diplomatic absences; and serving as Secretary of State under Monroe. Along the way he is involved in the Missouri Compromise; fighting New England secession during the War of 1812 period; fighting to protect native American lands; pushing for internal improvements and a national bank system; contesting the spread of slavery; ``and just continual writing of political and historical tracts.I think today Adams is most remembered for his incessant opposition to slavery.  He most prominently fought this battle surprisingly after his Presidential loss to Jackson during serving more than a decade in the House, the only former President to do so. First, he fought to protect the right of citizens to petition Congress for redress of grievances, particularly as regards slavery and its expansion. This led to multiple censure attempts and criticism, but surprisingly his colleagues respected his determination.  It is one of the many strengths of the book that the author initiates us into the bitter hostility and hatred that developed in the House during this period (1834-48) just prior to the Civil War. In addition, Adams argued on behalf of the escaped slaves in the famous Supreme Court Amistad case (1841).  Kaplan is at his best in his careful analysis of Adams' argument--Adams' use of language is particularly noteworthy.The author's research is impeccable and complete as reflected in 38 pages of end notes and a wonderful 8 page Bibliographic Essay. There are some helpful illustrations, many in full color.  But most of all, the book is just beautifully written.  At times, the length of the book makes it ""a slog"" to keep reading, but it is all here.  Perhaps now JQA can claim a more appropriate place in our political history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUD4V2422R66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061915416#wasThisHelpful","RSUD4V2422R66","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Grisham and Scott Turow pioneered the ""legal thriller"" format; Grisham has continued to develop his skills as a novelist, not just a legal novelist, in some 27 novels.  When he started, particularly with ""The Firm,"" his books tended to have a good deal of razzle dazzle excitement, and I could not turn the pages fast enough.  But reflecting his maturity as a novelist, and perhaps also his move (at least part time) to Virginia, his more recent books have undertaken to inform (I hesitate to say ""educate"") the reader about important issues while not diminishing the impact of the story line. For example, his books have dealt with the death penalty; judicial campaign abuse; mass torts lawyers, as well as various criminal justice issues. This approach has placed a significant extra burden on Grisham: namely to hold the reader's interest while these other issues pop up.  He has met this challenge very well in my opinion, having read virtually all of his legal novels.This novel is just chock full of interesting issues that contribute to the development of the story line.  Grisham is no fan of mega firms (nor am I having practiced in a couple), anyd why they are often unpleasant places for especially young lawyers to practice is a point repeatedly raised here. The story is set in New York City, Washington, D.C., and a small southern Appalachian Virginia town, and Grisham is accurate in describing NYC and DC (although I am still puzzled by his term ""central D.C.""). The central character Samantha, a large firm associate who moves to a small legal aid firm, learns about many new things she had not previously experienced, as does the reader. They include: the horror of black lung disease and how seeking compensation can drag on for years; how local governments hire private contractors to ""strong arm"" minor violators to pay up their fines or go to jail; how caps on punitive damages (as in in Virginia) limit recoveries even for wrongful deaths; and how garnishments can be imposed based on old out of date judgments.  These are all important factors in Appalachia.But the most interesting theme is the power of the coal industry in these areas. Particularly effective is Grisham's discussion of ""mountaintop removal"" where mountains are literally destroyed to get at the coal, with the resulting detritus pushed into surrounding valleys and streams. We learn about sludge and how slurry impoundments can fail and discharge 300 million gallons of sludge onto surrounding communities.  We also discover that giant coal trucks generate an enormous amount of deadly auto accidents. But the key problem remains black lung.  The law fails to protect the local residents for several reasons: juries that fear to penalize the industry for fear of retribution or the loss of precious jobs; the expense of litigation; and state laws which favor the coal companies.  It is all quite an education as one reads the novel.The novel manifests some of Grisham's weaknesses as well.  His villains tend to be somewhat ""cardboardish""; his vendetta with the FBI and U.S. Attorneys continues (perhaps a legacy from his criminal defense days in Mississippi); and sometimes major ethical issues are skipped by (such as Samantha trying to get her high level DOJ mom to call off the bureau). But these are small blemishes.  I am happy to report that Grisham can still deliver some exciting page-turning razzle dazzle (beginning at page 352).  This book is just typical Grisham which means it is another interesting and informative well-constructed yarn by a master of this genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OMQ6OUCJ7Y4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553714X#wasThisHelpful","R1OMQ6OUCJ7Y4X","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a number of years now, a somewhat ferocious debate has ranged around the issue of how federal judges should interpret ambiguous statutes.  One school of thought, most prominently advocated by Justice Scalia, limits the judge's options to what is explicitly stated in the statute's text, dictionaries,  and certain canons of construction.  An alternative approach argues for the use of ""legislative history"" such as committee and conference reports to cast light on ambiguous provisions. In this fine book, Judge Robert Katzmann, Chief Judge of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, discusses these issues from the perspective of his long consideration of the topic.  Before he was placed on the bench, the author spent many years at the Brookings Institution, The Governance Institution, and Georgetown University examining judiciary-legislative relationships, including publications on statutory interpretation. Despite the explosive nature of the topic, this book is coolly analytical and exhaustive in its consideration of related issues. But to be sure, the author is firmly in favor of reliance upon appropriate legislative history where necessary.One of the author's major themes is the need for the judiciary to have a better understanding of Congress and the lawmaking process.  So, a valuable early chapter focuses upon this topic, especially the important role of legislative staffs. Another theme is that probably the best place to look for assistance in interpreting ambiguous statutes is to the administrative agencies that implement them. The legislative staffs intentionally generate legislative history material (particularly in committee and conference reports) to guide the agencies; they seem to get it, why not the courts?  Ignorance of Congressional rules, norms, and practices is one big reason. So a very insightful chapter focuses upon this relationship, including discussion of the tools Congress utilizes to insure the agencies implement the intended purpose of statutes.  These include confirmation hearings, investigations, authorization and oversight hearings, floor statements of key legislators, appropriation hearings and other devices. This material would seem to be of great potential value to courts as well.The core of the book is found in chapter 4, ""Judicial Interpretation of Statutes."" Here the author argues that the hallmark of interpretation should be a search for the purpose Congress intended in ambiguous statutes.  He then discusses how legislative history can contribute toward ascertaining Congressional purpose.  He places much emphasis upon the materials generated by staffs that is relied upon by legislators when voting, even if they have not thoroughly reviewed the proposed bill itself. This analysis is used in oversight of agencies; why should courts not rely upon it as well.  This chapter also contains an excellent analysis of the arguments put forward by the ""textualists"" such as Scalia in rejecting legislative history. There is much insight and virtually no vitriol in this critical dimensions of the issue, despite the author's own position on the question.  This is followed by a critique of textualism, particularly the judicial lack of familiarity of legislative processes and tools. An interesting section discusses the canons of construction so heavily relied upon by Justice Scalia and Bryan A. Garner in their important ""Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts."" The author points out that few staff members are familiar with these canons.  Judge Richard Posner in my opinion really lacerated the canons argument in his recent ""Reflections on Judging"" book.One strong point of the book is that an entire chapter is devoted to three case studies in how the author and fellow second circuit judges interpreted ambiguous statutes, and how the Supreme Court viewed their handiwork.  These cases well illustrate how different judges can reach opposing but reasonable interpretations of the same ambiguous statute. Finally, the author devotes a chapter to suggestions of how greater understanding can be promoted between Congress and the judiciary--another constructive contribution to the debate.Anyone seriously interested in this important topic needs to read this thoughtful book. In 100 pages of text and 38 pages of invaluable end notes, the author can thoroughly educate a reader as to the pros and cons of textualism v. purposivism.  But the most important message remains: courts need to know a lot more about the procedures, techniques, and cues of Congress in order to do a satisfactory job of interpreting statutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FM4JMZMRTY0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199362130#wasThisHelpful","R3FM4JMZMRTY0E","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, we occasionally see references to Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) and his famous prediction that population would grow much faster than the resources available to support it. Malthus supported his prediction with an extensive analysis in his ""An Essay on the Principle of Population"" (1803). However, as this excellent book informs us, Malthus is more than just a footnote to history. Concern about the growth of population, and related concepts like life expectancy, fertility, and mortality rates, antedated Malthus' birth. On the one hand, Europeans felt that growing population indicated economic health; but was it growing or declining?  Moreover, it was assumed that the physical environment could support greater population. Some thinkers, such as Godwin, felt a golden future would lie ahead. When Malthus not only challenged these rosy predictions, but supported his position with mathematical analysis, his book attracted immediate attention.Malthus, a talented mathematician, based his analysis on empirical rather than theological truth. His dismal prediction, he argued, was beyond government power to mitigate. He also took aim at the Poor Laws which he argued did far more harm than good. These controversial theories were widely challenged, particularly by the British Romantics (particularly Wordsworth and Coleridge and the Lake Poets) who saw a bountiful future in contrast to that of Malthus. Particularly his criticism of the Poor Laws set these folks off against Malthus. The author credits Malthus with the creation of environmental economics in particular and modern economics in general. Malthus continued to seek empirical support for this theories after he published his book (often updated), through extensive travel, reading, and the accumulation of economic and census data.The author traces Malthus' influence after his 1834 death through the Victorians.  He discusses Carlyle, Ruskin, Herbert Spencer, and Thomas Huxley among others. I found it most interesting that Malthus made a real impact in the 20th century of all things.  Some writers traced the interest in Eugenics, the spread of contraceptives, and the decline in population all to Malthus. Both H.G. Wells and Keynes advocated his ideas. The themes of overpopulation and resource depletion attracted writers like C.P. Snow, Bertrand Russell, Sartre, Buckminster Fuller, and Julian and Aldous Huxley.  At mid-century, Ehrlich and his ""Population Bomb,"" the Green Revolution, carbon footprints, and Spaceship Earth were all traceable to Malthus' ideas.  The final chapter on ""Malthus Today"" demonstrates his continued relevance particularly in connection with our concerns about environment, water supplies, and migration.This is a pretty concentrated volume--heavy on analysis and ideas.  It is a remarkable thorough and thoughtful analysis of a number of important intellectual ideas and public intellectuals. It has ample endnotes but no bibliography. The author's ability to demonstrate Malthus' relevance even till today makes this an extremely interesting book--but one that is best read in small pieces at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15KMG92XTVCE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674728718#wasThisHelpful","R15KMG92XTVCE2","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This turned out to be a somewhat different book than I had anticipated.  I had read with great benefit the author's two judicial biographies on Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia, so I assumed that this book would be another judicial biography. In fact, it is something quite different, and I am glad it is.  In her own words (at p. 7), the author declares, ""Rather than biography,it examines the cultural and political shifts that merged with Sotomayor's life and led to her appointment.""  This is not to say there is not a good deal of biographical material here--but its focus is far broader.  The Justice's well-received autobiography, ""My Beloved World,"" opened to me the story of Puerto Ricans in America, both the good and the challenging.  It was an important education for me.  This book is concerned with the political, social, and economic factors, coupled with Sotomayor's own incredible drive and talents, that she maneuvered through to secure her Supreme Court appointment. That is, why was she right for the times when the Court vacancy arose? For those really interested in the Justice, I recommend that the two books be read in conjunction.Particularly interesting is the discussion of Puerto Rican interest groups dedicated to promoting the appointment and advancement of Hispanic candidates for the judiciary.  The author recounts how years of effort had preceded Sotomayor's arrival on the scene.  Judge Jose Cabranes in the opinion of many had the best chances for the Court--yet he aged out of contention because of the lack of Hispanic political muscle. Political factors were clearly at work in the denial of a D.C. Circuit seat to Miguel Estrada, which the author discusses in a highly insightful chapter.Yet Sotomayor made it and why this is so constitutes the central recurring theme of the book.  Once again, the book reminds us of how bizarre sometimes the process of selecting nominees for the Court can be, especially in these days of intense partisan warfare.  One need only read John Dean's book on Nixon's selection of Rehnquist (whose name he could not even remember at times) to see a further example. Here the author effectively traces the final competition between Sotomayor, Judge Diane Wood, and Elena Kagan to secure President Obama's nod for the nomination. Confidential letter writing to the White House; activating long-term contacts with White House and DOJ staffers; the use of published articles and books (I had forgotten about Jeffrey Rosen's harsh ""New Republic"" appraisal of Sotomayor) all played a role here. Sotomayor's offhand ""wise Latina"" statement and its impact is thoroughly reviewed by the author.  The famous ""Ricci"" firefighter qualification case, where Sotomayor's Second Circuit panel was accused of devoting insufficient attention or analysis before denying the appeal, also played a role in the nomination battle.  And of course, facing some confrontational GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee injected yet further unusual elements into the process.In short, the Justice's autobiography is her view of her challenging pathway to the Court, focusing as it should upon her own battles, talents, and successes.  This book is concerned with the environment in which Sotomayor developed from a poor Bronx childhood, into degrees from Princeton and Yale Law, a stint in Robert Morganthau's district attorney's office, years in private practice, and her appointments to the Southern District of New York and the Second Circuit (some 17 years worth of judicial experience).  But why her time had come had much to do with the context of what was going on external to her own efforts--the increasing political influence of Hispanics; the particular outlook of Obama; her contacts, colleagues, and other influential supporters.  This book melds the personal Sotomayor together with the context of American politics to fully explain how she made the leap to the Court.The book cover a lot of ground in 260 pages.  There are helpful end notes; a brief selective bibliography; some pictures and illustrations; and a helpful index.  I only wish that the author had chosen to discuss a few more Court cases, but the ones she discusses are certainly important, though it is hard to say how representative they are of the Justice's oral argument techniques and ability to influence her colleagues.  The book also raises the issue implicitly as to whether the Justice is too publicly active outside the Court, or just a much-needed breath of fresh air in a stodgy old institution.  Quite a masterful study that adds much to our understanding of this most unique Justice who has a long career ahead of her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDZR1WC6FBG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374298742#wasThisHelpful","R2WDZR1WC6FBG2","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really two books in one.  First, the author focuses upon FDR's efforts to circumvent isolationist opposition and suspicion, in the form of Charles A. Lindberg among others, and the Neutrality Act to get assistance to Britain and France as the specter of Hitler grows ever more ominous. The author argues that FDR was weakened in his ability to act as a result of (1) his failed court packing plan of 1937; (2) his ineffectual attempt to purge opposition Democrats from Congress in 1938; and (3) because his second term was soon to run out, he was a very lame duck indeed. Using devices such as ""cash and carry, ""lend lease,"" "" and ""trading"" war materials for British bases, FDR was able to get some aid to Britain and France, arguing that these nations were our ""first line of defense.""The second focus of the book is extremely interesting: will FDR defy the two-term tradition and run for re-election in 1940? We enter thereupon the strange period of FDR as a Sphinx; that is, will he won't he and if so, why.  FDR had planned to retire to Hyde Park and his new (the first) presidential library; he also needed badly to replenish his finances.  Yet, as the specter of war grew, and he surveyed the field, he did not see more than a few Democrats (such as Cordell Hull) who could win a presidential election, fight a war, and protect the goals and ideals of the New Deal.  Moe argues, and I think he is correct, that for most of 1940 FDR really had not made up his mind whether to run.  But as a proven leader in crisis, and because of GOP threats to the New Deal, he eventually opted to run.  Of course, this may all be bunk and he intended to run all the time--but I think the author is persuasive in rejecting this theory.But by not stating his intentions clearly, he ran the risk of the convention nominating somebody else.  So this need to be ""drafted"" to offset his deviation from the third term tradition led to some puzzling actions.  Even when it became clear that the convention would nominate him, he almost threw it all overboard by his insistence that Henry Wallace had to be the VP nominee or he would reject the nomination.  This threw the convention into a confused cauldron of hostility before Wallace was ultimately selected. Given that FDR was one of the most astute political operatives in American history, this whole Sphinx/Wallace episode is most puzzling.This book is outstanding for several reasons.  It is extremely well written--good history does not have to be hampered by professional historian lingo and approaches.  Moe is quite good on focusing on the key individuals around (and in some cases such as Wendell Willkie opposing) FDR, including Joseph P. Kennedy, Harry Hopkins, James Farley, Harold Ickes, and Cactus Jack Garner.  His discussion of the early FDR-Churchill relationship is quite illuminating. Most importantly, he is quite astute in probing FDR's likely thought processes as 1940 approaches.The book is supported by some outstanding photographs, helpful notes, and a good bibliography.  The appendix consists of two key memos I had never seen before drafted by Felix Frankfurter and Archibald MacLeish, at FDR's request, on the topic of whether he should run again.  Encompassing 300 or so pages, this book stands as our most complete analysis of FDR and the third term issue and the dilemmas he faced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KYSRZFJE22BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199981914#wasThisHelpful","R3KYSRZFJE22BH","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This interesting volume is a collective history primarily of the first three generations of the Thomas H. Huxley family.  Huxley (1825-1895) was the grand old man of 19th Century empirical science that emerged with Darwin and came to dominate Victorian Science and into the twentieth century. Often known as ""Darwin's Bulldog,"" Huxley was not only a vigorous defender of Darwinian evolutionary theory, but also a leading scientist and scientific educator himself. The book also discusses his son, Leonard (1860-1933), who was an important educator as well as the author of several leading biographies of Victorian scientists--his father and Joseph Hooker primarily.  These bios, which still merit reading today, are in the Victorian format of ""The Life and Letters of ......""  Usually they were multiple-volumes and chock full of documents.  This format has largely disappeared today which I think is a shame.The third generation is most familiar to us today.  Growing up in Southern California in the 1950""s, I certainly was familiar with Aldous Huxley ((1894-1963), author of ""Brave New World"" among other works.  Aldous became the model Britisher who left the misty and rainy isles and flowered in the warmth of Southern California.  He made money writing for the Hollywood Studios, lived in remote cabins, and was one of the earliest advocates of LSD--somewhat ahead even of Leary. He was also just a remarkable writer.  His brother, Sir Julian Huxley (1887-1975), was a distinguished biologist, head of UNESCO for a time, and the author of several important books. It is easy to see why this is such a scintillating book given its central characters.A word should also be said about the author, Ronald W. Clark (no relation, unfortunately).  Clark wrote an enormous amount of books, principally outstanding scientific bios on folks like Darwin, Einstein, Freud, Edison and Julian Huxley.  Yet, he had no scientific background--holding no university degree and having been a war correspondent during WWII--but this was actually his strength.  He dug into each new scientific area and mastered it; that made him a superior choice to explain it to layman readers in language they could understand.A fine book well worthy of serious consideration so many years after its publication in 1968.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B339PN3K2YDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0434135801#wasThisHelpful","R3B339PN3K2YDR","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After reading the essays, it means to me that empirical, secular, sometimes agnostic, often confrontational group of scientists who emerged during the 1850-1900 period, in the wake of the Darwinian revolution, and were determined to free science from any religious constraints  and to transform it into a true profession.The first collection of essays are grouped under ""forging friends.""  How did these scientists come together?  Co-editor Gowan Dawson argues that even before Darwin's ""Origin"" was published in 1859, a small group had unified in order to attack the Cuvier techniques in paleontology.  Principally, the group was led by Thomas Huxley and Joseph Hooker, both of whom were major figures in the scientific naturalism movement. Later, it was natural for this group to join together to defend Darwin (who avoided conflict and confrontation) when his book was vigorously attacked by religionists and more traditional scientists, such as Richard Owen. An interesting essay relates that reliable Victorian hobby of mountain climbing to unifying the scientific group. George Levine focuses upon the literary quality of the group's writings and asks whether these strict empiricists really started from some metaphysical assumptions that took them beyond science.The second heading is ""institutional politics.""  An important essay focuses upon Huxley and his service on various royal commissions and in institutional positions and how they were utilized to promote scientific naturalism and enhance the teaching of science. Huxley, who is really the giant during this period, used his control over national examinations (the focus of a second essay) and the establishment of a new science school at Kensington to professionalize scientific education and further reduce any influence of religion. In short, the group was effective in utilizing politics to secure their objectives. One secret to the groups success, as discussed in an essay on Joseph Hooker, was that with few exceptions, the scientists conformed to the Victorian idea of a ""gentleman."" No outright attacks on religion; courteous and moderate to a fault. They were not scary but rather polite, while firm in their views.  Only Huxley, ""Darwin's bulldog,"" had difficulty in following this ""Christian gentleman"" approach.The third grouping of essays is captioned ""broader alliances.""  These essays focus upon allies the scientists developed.  One interesting ally was the Sunday Lecture Societies, who sought to put on programs of lectures on Sundays, often meeting firm religionist opposition. Some of these lectures were given by the scientists.  An interesting essay discusses the famous ""metaphysical society,"" which presented lectures to its members on many intellectual topics including science and religion. Once again, good manners prevailed in the meetings and in extensive published articles, which further publicized scientific naturalism themes. A final essay in this section deals with the argument that the uniformity of physical laws either proved or disproved the existence of God.The final set of essays appear under the designation ""new generations.""  The topics here include the alliance of the scientists with modernizing religious writers; the impact of statistical analysis in published articles which tended to turn off many general readers; the role of Nature magazine which became the preferred mechanism for younger scientists to present theses and respond to disputes; and finally the Rationalist Press Association, another device by which the scientists could draw upon radical thinkers.The book includes notes at the end of each essay; a bibliography of major works on scientific naturalism; a list of contributors; and an index.  I find this entire topic extremely interesting, and this book serves as a good introduction to why this is such a fascinating area.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTS9O5M8ALSU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022610950X#wasThisHelpful","RTS9O5M8ALSU8","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never been intimidated by the term ""popular history""; good historical writing is good historical writing. And especially given the current proclivities of academic historians to write only for their own colleagues, in their own unique jargon, solid historical analysis aimed at the general reader is to be encouraged. Joseph J. Ellis is undoubtedly well known to the general reader for his string of outstanding books focusing on the founders.  His Pulitzer-Prize for ""Founding Brothers"" attests to his significant impact. But this book was even so much better than I had expected.Ellis' focus is upon the summer of 1776 just at the beginning of the Revolutionary War. He develops an effective dual focus: the political juxtaposed against the military. In nine chapters, we see the interplay of these two elements--how the military impacted the political developments, and vice versa. Since Ellis has written individual bios of Jefferson, Washington, and especially John Adams, he is well versed with the main characters. Yet, I found his analysis surprisingly fresh and engrossing, especially his recounting of the key early battles in New York where the Americans came perilously close to losing it all.Ellis is particularly skilled in focusing on the human dimension in his writing; this book is no exception as his insights into Washington and his strategy are most impressive. One can only wonder about the level of GW's military skills, and how lucky he was. Similarly perceptive are Ellis' insights into Lord William Howe, the overall British commander, and how his paradoxical desire for reconciliation overrode his military leadership as he permitted the Continental Army (such as it was) to escape destruction.Ellis leaves off at the point when Washington has evacuated his troops out of NYC. At this point, several issues are clear. First, it will be a long war since the British blew their chance for early annihilation of the Continental army. Second, no matter how dark the military situation, and the summer of 1776 had been the darkest during the war, the Continental Congress and the American people they represented, would never settle for anything less than total independence.I found the final chapter,  on ""Necessary Fictions"" especially interesting, as Ellis explodes some myths held by both sides of this military and political confrontation.There are some helpful notes that demonstrates Ellis solid research, particularly his reliance upon correspondence and documents. There are also three helpful maps and some colorful illustrations. Ellis has produced 240 pages of effective and perceptive analysis that will enthrall both the professional historian as well as the motivated general reader. A vital experience that both can share and benefit from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55U2GY1Y2SCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307701220#wasThisHelpful","R55U2GY1Y2SCM","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent murder mystery/trial tale, with some unusual dimensions. First, this was one of the first American trials to have a complete record kept; so the author's accountof the trial is replete with detail and authenticity. Moreover, you may have heard of two of the lead defense counsel: Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr--not exactly allies under normal circumstances. Finally, we learn much about the rough and challenging life followed by New Yorkers during this period. So there are several dimensions added to a fascinating murder mystery.I found the author highly attentive to the procedures followed in criminal trials of this period. There are some stark departures from current procedure, and it is obvious we have evolved in the right direction. The murder trial is also set against an interesting political background, namely in the wake of George Washington's death, Burr is at work trying to undermine the Federalist Bank of the U.S. in favor of his water company, so as to enhance his political influence in the upcoming presidential election of 1800. The potency of the fever sweeping the area, and its substantial death toll, also are recounted.So, this is more than just a fine murder mystery--one can pick up some valuable information about early trials, the pre-duel careers of Hamilton and Burr, and life in a very fearsome NYC. The author has done solid historical research, as his ample notes and list of sources establish. But fundamentally, this is a solid mystery story above all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP78ATNL1GFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956458#wasThisHelpful","R3GP78ATNL1GFI","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently took a trip to the beach and thought it would be a great opportunity to try out this product. This is the first messenger bag I have used, and I found this one to have many good points but also some deficiencies. First the good things: it has ample capacity (I shoved in a fair amount of paper files, books, and writing materials). It held all this easily so its capacity is a great advantage.  It also appears quite durable, being made of top-flight materials. Particularly effective are the Velcro strips that are easily engaged (with one hand even) and really secure the contents quite effectively. The interior design is well thought out with several internal pockets and two large divided compartments, either of which can hold a laptop or table securely. It is touted as being waterproof, and it sure looks it when closed up.There are several problem areas as well: I most missed a handle on the top of the closed bag. Without one, you must use the strap to handle the bag at all times. There is a small handle attached, but it is toward the bottom and is covered completely when the bag is closed. It also would have been helpful if the bag had some built in structure when empty; as it is, when empty it just dissolves into a heap.All and all, it worked well for me on the trip and I am sure will do the job for others also. I am informed it comes with a lifetime guarantee as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS3L7Z8Y1UB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MOGSKM#wasThisHelpful","R2OS3L7Z8Y1UB5","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting and quite extensive (532 pages including end notes) study of how the Nazis both utilized and attacked culture. The author has chosen as his principal source the issues of the Volkischer Beobachter, the Nazi newspaper that began publication in 1921, which was the principal cultural and political propaganda source for the party. The author claims to have read virtually every issue of the paper, and I believe it given the extensive and sometimes overwhelming detail reflected in the book. This is principally a book for the specialist or those well versed in the history of the Third Reich--otherwise a reader risks simply being overcome.While most of us are generally aware of how the Nazis attacked what they termed ""degenerative art,"" this is but a small part of the culture war that they fought up to and including the end of the war. The Nazis sought to demonstrate that their central values and ideas were identical to the key concepts of western civilization. They did this by analyzing art, literature, music and other cultural elements to demonstrate that the ideas expressed therein were parallel to their own ideology. Moreover, they sought to identify past artists (e.g., Bach, Mozart, Goethe, Durer, Wagner) who embodied Nazi values.But even this was but a part of the story: they also launched an anti-Semitic campaign to show how prominent thinkers in the past (e.g., Luther, Shakespeare, Wagner) were emphatic in sharing their anti-Semitic perspectives. As part of this campaign, they also undertook to purge Jewish cultural influences from German culture, by attacking individuals like Heine and Mendelssohn. It is amazing how much energy and resources the party poured into all this cultural activity, validating Plato's warning about the political impact of art.The author also discusses additional key themes in the Nazi cultural offensive. The party embraced classical and Romantic culture, while attacking the Enlightenment as a French subversive force. Their love for Romanticism (rather than realism and Modernism) was fervid. Music was particularly a key area for this, with Beethoven and (of course) Wagner playing major roles. Interestingly, the party utilized culture to attack Weimar and the Versailles treaty. Not surprisingly, culture was used to glorify battle and prepare the German population for the ""ennobling"" experience of war. All of this is gone into in exhausting detail.The amount of research undertaken by the author is amazing--the notes alone cover 68 pages. He has also included a large number of illustrations of paintings demonstrating his themes (those of Durer are particularly helpful). But it is a very long and challenging work.  However, it really covers the waterfront on this issue and is well worth looking at if you have any interest in the Third Reich period and/or the political uses of art. There can be no better discussion of the issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1SMD4YTLGOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107020492#wasThisHelpful","R1B1SMD4YTLGOO","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There exists a mountain of books discussing, arguing, explaining, and disputing H.L.A. Hart's ""The Concept of Law"" (1961) (CL).  This is understandable since it has been the dominant work of legal philosophy published in the second half of the 20th century. Most of these books are heavily analytical, and some such as those by the late Ronald Dworkin are highly critical.  Despite the title, this book by A.W.B. Simpson occupies a somewhat unique position in this literature. It certainly focuses upon Hart (whom Simpson knew at Oxford), but it also discusses Oxford jurisprudence, Simpson's own life, American v. British legal education, and some juicy gossip. I found it one of the most valuable books on the CL that I have read and recommend it without reservation.Simpson first of all introduces the reader to Hart, his philosophical education, Oxford (ordinary language) linguistic philosophy, and his teaching at Oxford. This section is particularly interesting because Simpson asserts Hart was not interested in legal issues or the common law, but rather philosophical issues. The second chapter discusses the Corpus Chair of Jurisprudence, which Hart occupied, how law was studied at Oxford, Hart's legal education, and the role of philosophy in Oxford legal education  during the 1950-1970 period. One learns that Oxford during the 19th and 20th centuries had Corpus Professors who really did not focus on jurisprudence but upon other interests. The author contrasts Oxford legal education with its American counterpart.In the third chapter, the topic is how jurisprudence had fallen into disrepute by the time Hart assumed the Corpus Chair in 1952. His job was to rejuvenate the discipline and raise the intellectual tone of jurisprudential study. This he did by coauthoring a book on legal causation, but most directly by unleashing the CL in 1961. Simpson begins his detailed examination of the book and its key concepts in this chapter. Basically, Hart sought to answer the question: ""what is law?""I found the 4th chapter especially valuable, since Simpson there tries to identify the sources of Hart's ideas that reached maturity in the CL. While some of his conclusions can be debated, the author thoroughly reviews the pertinent literature in making his argument. All sorts of folks are discussed, including Kelsen, Weber, Salmond, John Austin, and many others. Whether Hart was a Isaiah Berlinian hedgehog or fox occupies chapter 5.Next, the author focuses upon some defects in the CL--but in a fairly gentle way unlike Dworkin. Interestingly, Simpson points out that the CL deals exclusively with the English (and probably) American legal systems, and has had little impact in the Civil Law countries. Simpson is particularly critical in asserting Hart ignored the common law and how it functions--so much so that Simpson wrote an important book on this topic. This chapter is probably one of the best ways to really get at the heart of the CL.The final chapter ""judges"" Hart from a number of different interesting perspectives:  his role as editor of the Clarendon Law Series; his famous exchanges with Lon Fuller of Harvard Law; the structure of the CL; and Hart as a philosopher. It struck me that the late author really had a great deal of respect for Hart, particularly since he started a great dialogue that revived the professional discussion of the philosophy of law.A quirky book, to be sure, but extremely valuable, including Simpson's annotated bibliography of jurisprudential literature. It is quite helpful to have a copy of Nicola Lacey's superb bio of Hart close at hand. Whether new to Hart or an old hand, there is much to savor in this interesting book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U063A5LLGNEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199693323#wasThisHelpful","R2U063A5LLGNEB","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whatever one may think about Judge Bork (who died on December 19, 2012), and believe me I have had my moments, the core essential truth about him shines throughout this brief book: he was first of all always a teacher, whether at Yale, while in the Department of Justice, on the D.C. Circuit bench, or while serving in conservative think tanks. I found this, presumably his last book, extremely fascinating. This is because he writes with his usual clarity and precision; injects some examples of his infectious and subversive sense of humor; and makes sure the reader understands what in his view the actual facts were, let the chips fall where they may.While the book is obviously concerned in part with Watergate, there is much more to indulge in here as well. He first takes the time to educate the reader a bit on the office of the Solicitor General, about which I have found few non-Washington types are familiar. Bork then discusses how he got the job of SG, including his few interactions with President Nixon. Bork observations on Nixon, throughout the book, I found extremely interesting and much more perceptive that most of the material I have read on the President. A particularly interesting discussion involves when Justice Douglas (no hero to Bork) enjoined the continued bombing of Cambodia and how SG Bork was able to neutralize this action with the help of the remainder of the Supreme Court.While the main event, Watergate, is developing, SG Bork becomes involved in the investigation and resignation of Spiro Agnew. The possibility of dual impeachments of the President and VP is the background overhanging Bork's actions during this episode. Even more pressure arises when he is invited to undertake the role of Nixon's lead defense counsel. When it rains, it pours, as they say.The core of the book is, of course, his discussion of the the ""Saturday Night Massacre."" The insights Bork adds, having been the key participant, to this drama alone justify reading this book. Particularly important were the steps now Acting AG Bork undertook to ensure the professional completion of the Watergate investigation, the continued independent functioning of DOJ, and that things did not fly out of control. A cool hand on the wheel is always nice in a major crisis.The book runs around 130 pages, including a few endnotes. I found only a few mistakes which I am sure the Judge would have corrected had he seen the book in galleys: Griffin Bell was not the Maryland U.S. Attorney who led the Agnew investigation (p. 37); Earl Silbert was the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney (not an AUSA) during the Watergate investigation (p. 71); and Johns Hopkins is not located in Annapolis p. 113). I don't know if the Judge left behind material for a complete autobiography--but I sure hope so after reading what may be his last important lesson for us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZ42XJGKZKEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594036810#wasThisHelpful","R1NZ42XJGKZKEH","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone interested in Winston Churchill and the politics of persuasion will find this a delightful as well as informative book. The author focuses upon a somewhat unique characteristic of WC, his use of meals as opportunities to learn facts from guests or to persuade allies that they should support his policies.After an initial chapter (""The Importance of Dinners""), author Cita Stelzer (currently a researcher at Churchill College) devotes Section 1 of the book to actual studies of WC in mealtime action. These include WC and FDR off Newfoundland meeting at sea in August 1941; WC at the at the White House for Christmas 1941 to seal up an American alliance after Pearl Harbor; big three meals at Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam; and a less successful 1953 effort with Ike in Bermuda.The heart of the book is the author's careful analysis of the mealtime techniques WC employed as part of his effort to persuade. He carefully set the stage by picking the location; he minutely oversaw the menu and other preparations; he did all that was possible to relax his guest(s), including abundant cigars, liquor and good cheer. Whether he was making his weekly wartime reports to the King, having picnics with American generals, or probing his own military leaders for information, WC was a master at using meals as prime opportunities to ingratiate and persuade those who had something he needed, including alliances to win the second war.The second section of the book is also quite interesting.  It discusses WC's preferences in foods and tobacco. An important chapter seeks to knock down the presumption that WC drank far too much; the author here exposes his techniques for appearing to drink more than was actually the case. But this is an important point given criticisms that WC's alcohol intake impacted on his war leadership. A final chapter discusses how WC was fairly meticulous about conforming his own consuming behavior to wartime rationing requirements.The author's discussion is supported effectively by abundant illustrations--of bills, meal locations, menus, and the key leaders with whom he interacted and dined. Also included is a section with brief bios of his dinner companions, endnotes, and a bibliography. All this runs 314 or so pages, and it goes quite quickly as this is one of those rare books that is both informative and just plain fun to read.

"I have never been that much into the Civil War, but a recent trip to Charleston, S.C., sparked my interest in this book--and I am glad it did since this is just an outstanding piece of historical writing. This is not a book of military history, although as Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" demonstrated, that can be engrossing.  While there is plenty of battlefield coverage here, the author's focus is on the context of the Civil War. That is, he discusses the social dimensions of the war, the economic considerations, internal Confederate conflicts, and other key elements that put the war into a fuller setting.For example, the initial chapter discusses the economic realities of the southern states, which controlled most of the wealth in the country prior to the war. One question I always had was how possibly the southern leadership ever felt it could win an armed insurrection. Now I have a much better understanding of that issue. Moreover, the author takes great care in explaining what factors (e.g., growing northern electorate; militant abolitionism; the election of Lincoln) pushed the South toward secession.After this background, the author proceeds chronologically through the war, explaining the military developments in just enough detail so the reader can follow what is occurring in that aspect. So early on, significant Confederate military victories emerge, but the four key border states remain in the Union. But then Union victories, particularly at Gettsburg and in Tennessee, alter the military situation.This development has a direct impact on one key focus of the book: the role of African-Americans (initially) as slaves, a large number of whom abandon their masters, some of whom join the Union forces, others of whom demand land to cultivate and education. The emotional impact on the southerners of this change in slave conditions as the Union armies penetrate deeper into the South, and their wealth and control begin to evaporate, is a vital component of the war story.A further important dimension is the internal dissenion within the southern ranks between large land owners, who are running things, and the smaller farmers upon whom demands are made for more taxes, joining the ranks, and contributing food and slaves to the war effort. As the war continues to go badly, the psychological pressures build upon the southerners as they see their entire way of life dissolving. With Lincoln's 1864 re-election, the proposed 13th amendment, and the loss of Atlanta, the picture becomes increasingly bleak as pressures build.I found it surprising that even after the war is lost, some southern leaders still felt they could negotiate terms that would permit them to retain their plantations and slaves. While this proved not the case, the author discusses postwar developments where elite control continued via black codes and the ""Jim Crow"" system.The book runs some 412 pages, including notes and bibliography. The author's research is extensive; his judgement and analysis reasoned and perceptive. The Civil War was a lot more than just battles; the reader now gets the full picture of what was occurring and what was to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNQZM3N1Z3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067030#wasThisHelpful","R2RNQZM3N1Z3P","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite many years studying Jefferson, I never cease to be amazed by the multiple dimensions of his intellectualism. This is particularly true of his independent career in science, at a time when he was writing the Declaration, serving in several high government positions, representing the nation in Paris and elsewhere, founding the University of Virginia, and building and rebuilding Monticello. While there are other books on this topic, the one is particularly effective since it focuses almost entirely upon TJ's scientific activities, discusses enough of the scientific context to orient the reader, and explores the topic is significant detail.The range of scientific topics is surprisingly vast--one wonders where the man got the time to carry on this sideline. TJ was not just a gifted amateur but a scientific mind of this first caliber. I had not been aware of his astute mathematical abilities. The author discusses how TJ was infuriated by the French scientist Comte de Buffon who ridiculed American animal and plant life as weak and degenerate. In response, Jefferson wrote his famous ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" shipped off Moose antlers and Mastodon bones to Paris, and confronted Buffon in person while serving in Paris. But this was just the beginning.The author discusses TJ's interests in geology; sea shell fossils; mineralogy; paleontology; the culture of Native Americans; slavery and race; astronomy; botany; chemistry; agricultural science; climate and geography; surveying; and exploring the West via Lewis and Clark.  Equally important, the author probes why TJ was so scientifically oriented, focusing upon his studies at William and Mary, his exposure to Scottish Enlightenment thought, and his years in the stimulating intellectual environment of Paris.There are some surprises uncovered by the author as well. He believes Jefferson was limited somewhat by his continuing belief in Biblical creation. For example, he could not accept that some species had become extinct. Jefferson was not interested in science for its own sake, but primarily if it had practical applications in the new nation. Hence his interest in designing plows, ciphers and sundials. The author provides a nice comparison on this point between John Adams and TJ. Finally, the author suggests that there was serious opposition to free-wheeling scientific inquiry by some, because they feared it would undermine religion and remove absolute values.The book runs 303 pages, including extensive notes attesting to the author's thorough research, and some helpful illustrations. While many topics are covered, the reader is not buried in detail since the book is very cogently organized and flows nicely. It is interesting to see this dimension of Jefferson examined so skillfully because it adds greatly to our understanding of the man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26VCF3J3QELMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300184034#wasThisHelpful","R26VCF3J3QELMC","A211GMNT1HY28Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A211GMNT1HY28Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Justice O'Connor did not mean this book for an academic audience, and that is its principal strength. We have scads of fine academic treatises on the Supreme Court. What is needed is a book that introduces the Court to general readers in an engaging fashion. This is that book. Incidentally, I might add, I have been a student of the Court for more than 45 years; yet I learned a few new things from the book myself.The book is almost conversational in tone, since it is akin to a collection of stories--yet packed with important information. The author has chosen to focus on a number of themes which one might not encounter in other books on the Court.  For example, she devotes chapters to Supreme Court humor; Court ""customs and traditions""; four justices she considers ""larger-than-life""; Supreme Court ""Firsts""; and how the Court came to occupy its present iconic building. I found her chapters on circuit riding, judicial retirement, the inauspicious beginnings of the Court, and how oral argument contributes to the work of the Justices to be the most interesting. The only ""dry"" chapter is the short one on the Court's changing jurisdiction--an important but not exactly an engrossing topic. The book runs 165 pages, not counting appendices, notes, and index.The author writes in an comfortable and informal fashion, incorporating helpful examples from her own period of Court service.  I found only one chapter to be one that I felt might overwhelm the general reader: that on ""Judicial Appointments."" While she does not discuss every appointment, it almost seems as if she does in 22 pages, and that's a lot on the reader's plate. I must say her passion for exclamation marks (!) was beginning to drive me up the wall after a while. The editing sometimes is lax, and the same information is repeated. She has included some very interesting illustrations, many of which I had not seen before, as well as some helpful endnotes.

"The Mineral Sunscreen SPF 25 - Beauty by Earth Natural, Mineral Sun Block SPF 25 has a lot going for it. It smells almost like coconuts or almonds or something I can't think of. The aroma is light so it doesn't enter a room before you do. I like that it is a natural SPF, water resistant and biodegradable. All those things are quite nice. I was looking forward to using it on my cruise last weekend. I didn't.The instructions say to ""apply liberally"". My husband was the first to apply it. He read the apply liberally, and took it to mean just that. However, he really shouldn't have done that. He wound up with a white clown face. I'm not being mean or anything like that. I'm just telling what happened. He smoothed and smoothed it, I tried to smooth some of it off of him. He tried to rinse it off but it was just like the water beaded right off. That would have been terrific except that he couldn't go out looking like that. Fortunately, we had taken another sunscreen and we used that when we got to the beach.When we got home, I decided to make sure he hadn't just applied it incorrectly. I took a very small dot and rubbed it on the back of my hand. It took a little doing to get the white to absorb some. I was left with a whitish shimmer that exaggerated my wrinkles.Like I said, it does smell nice and it feels smooth on the skin but if I use this again, I am certain it will take only a 1/4 teaspoon to apply it all over my body. Do NOT apply liberally.I will say this, the only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 3 star rating is if you want to have a white nose like the skiers do and you want something that stays on and doesn't come off easily, then this is for you. It would be perfect in that situation. I just wish I had known it stayed white.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"These 36 Chalkboard Labels from Labelholics are coming in so handy! I am currently organizing my ""sewing room"" and labeling boxes. This is not the first time I've tried labeling boxes. In the past I've written directly on the box, used masking tape, file folder labels and even a label machine which was nice but VERY expensive and the letters were quite small. They all worked for a short while but the problem I ran into was that the things in the boxes would change over time and yet the boxes were still usable. That's when I had to scrub off the old labels and put on new ones.That will never happen now that I have these 3.5"" x 2"" decorative chalkboard labels and chalk pen. All I have to do is place the label on the box, write what is inside the box and if I change my mind or if I decide to put something else in the box, I can simply erase the old writing and write something else on it. I can do that over & over for a very long time because these are of premium quality. They wash off cleanly and completely. Once I get all the boxes labeled my shelves in my new ""craft room"" will look and be organized in a beautiful way.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"My husband loves his new iPhone 6 and he loves it even more with the iPhone 6 Plus Screen Protector from iZEEKER. The tempered glass screen was easy to place on the phone. He just followed the directions that were on the cardboard envelop that the glass screen came in, used the two wipes that were enclosed, removed the clear plastic that protected the silicone adhesive side, centered it on his screen and placed it down. He then rubbed it a bit with the paper sleeve that had contained the glass and it its beautifully.He said that unlike the plastic ones we used on our old phones, this doesn't get a lot of fingerprints and oily look and feel to it. The plastic ones always looked smudged and smeared no matter what we did to clean them. Also, he can see the screen better than the plastic screens. There is practically no difference in the touch and responsiveness of the touch screen with this protector on.His screen stayed clear, smudge free, and easy to clean when it does get dirty. He is very happy and when he is happy, I'm happy. :-) Next, I'm gonna get one for MY phone.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"Well, this Electronic Bug Zapper by Pest Sentry sold by New Home Innovations works great. As soon as I plugged it in, it started zapping bugs. In fact, in the 20 - 30 minutes it took for me to test it out and take pictures the first time I used it, it probably zapped 40 - 50 bugs. That is wonderful. It is exactly what I wanted.The size is terrific as well. It is only 15"" so it doesn't take up a whole lot of space but it zaps a lot of bugs for it's small size. Although it is intended for use inside, we live in a normally dry climate and will use it outside most of the time. And that's another reason why I love the size. It is so portable. I can take it outside while we are outside and move it to our dry-porch when we come inside. That will keep it working for a very long time.The bug zapper is super easy to clean, too. Most of the bugs fall right onto the removable and washable tray. Ahem... my husband is in charge of that duty and if it weren't easy, he would complain. :-) Occasionally, larger bug has gotten stuck but he's in charge of that, too. He unplugs it, according to the manufacturers directions, and removes the larger bug with a cloth we keep close by. He then plugs it back in and I'm happy as I can be.Years ago we had one that made a buzzing noise all the time. I hated that one and so did our neighbors. This one is relatively quiet except if there are a whole bunch of bugs. Then it is busy doing what I wanted... getting rid of those pesky mosquitoes and other annoying flying bugs.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"Next to a baby, these Q.T. Bamboo, Super Soft Organic Bamboo Nursing Pads, are one of the softest things I've ever felt! And, next to baby's mom's sometimes tender breasts, these will feel super soft.The inside layer that goes up close to the skin is a very small weave fabric that looks like the smallest, softest terrycloth I've ever seen BUT it is not terrycloth. I guess that is the organic bamboo. These are also leak proof. I still remember having to change clothes several times a day because of the leaking even though I had some homemade flannel ones. They were nice but not as nice as these.I love the soft blue color that I chose. These will be for my best friends little boy when he arrives next month.

"I can't wait for this little girl to be born and neither can her mommy, daddy and 3 siblings. In fact her daddy posted a letter to her on multimedia today saying how they can't wait to see her and to hurry up and get here. I am putting together a package for the mom and part of that package will be this ample sized pink hearts & cherries Breastfeeding Nursing Cover By Amazing 4 Use.Although her mom has already nursed 3 other children, she is still pretty shy about nursing in public. In the past, she has used towels, sweaters and baby blankets but those can get hot for both the baby & the mother. This is made of a light weight, high-quality 100% cotton fabric and will allow both baby & mom to be comfortable even in the summer months. As it is turning winter in a week, she can still use this by wrapping the baby in a blanket to keep it nice and cozy yet placing this over herself & her baby. Because of the way it is designed the mom, who happens to be my great-niece, daughter of one of my favorite nieces who has already gone to heaven, can quickly check on her little girl any time she wants without losing her cover all together.

"Both my husband and I have high blood pressure and need to take our blood pressure every day. In the past, I've been using the wrist cuff ones from the drug store and I recently found out that the one I have isn't accurate. My doctor said I should get an upper arm machine. So, I was delighted to get this Slight Touch Fully Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.Since I got it, I have used it everyday and I'm now getting accurate measurements. It is as easy to use as my wrist cuff was. All I have to do is wrap it around my upper arm and press the button. The machine does all the rest. Plus, it keeps a record of both of our readings. Unlike my cuff one, this has a low battery indicator so I'll never be surprised by running out of power. Both my husband and I can easily read the LCD display.I can take it wherever I go in the nice carrying case that comes with it and it uses 4AA batteries which are easy to find no matter where we travel. I  originally got the cuff one because it is compact, easy to use and portable. That's exactly what I got with this Slight Touch blood pressure cuff but I also got accuracy and easy to read.

"I'm a senior citizen and I needed these! Of course, I no longer have ""that time"" come round every month but most senior citizens will agree with me that the older we get, the more the old pipes start to leak. I got these for those occasions when I am plagued with leaky pipes. And, guess what??? They work perfectly!The past few years I have been using those pads with the sticky stuff on the bottom of them and they absolutely drive me crazy. I'm not only a senior, I'm also a plus size and those sticky pads don't agree with me at all. By the time the day is off, they can be stuck to my thigh, my stomach or my face... well, not really my face but you get the idea. Nobody likes that feeling.However, with these Heart Felt Bamboo Reusable Cloth Menstrual Pads, I don't have to worry about the pipes and I don't have to worry about them being stuck to me in all kinds of uncomfortable places. These reusable pads have wings with a plastic snap. I just snap them around the panties where I would normally tape the disposable pads and the reusable pads stay comfortably in place all day long. Most of the time I forget I am wearing them.The charcoal helps to wick away any moisture, the waterproof fabric helps keep any stray moisture from escaping and the snaps hold them in place.

"This is so much fun! It is easy to use. Just plug it in and the lights flash & flash & flash. It can be installed or it can be taken along to a party and placed on the floor which is how I am using it. Although we are all senior citizens, most of our friends love to dance to the old songs of the 60's and 70's. I have taken this to three separate places and the lights truly add a lot of pizzazz to the party. Now they want me to bring this to all the parties.One place I put them on the stairs and that was fun but the lights on the back didn't show up as much as when I put it on the floor at the other parties. Of course it won't work for all parties but it's fun with our friends. Next month our grandkids will be in town and I know they will love the lights as well.There is no pre-setup needed. Just plug it into the wall and the seven different lights begin to move around. My friends discovered by accident that the lights are voice and music activated. The lights even change directions with the music.

"Okay, I confess... I got this with my dear friend in mind. She also happens to be my daughter-in-law's mother. My friend is a small and petite woman who has had multiple back surgeries and is in constant pain....especially while traveling. She lives 4 hours from me and my daughter-in-law so when she comes to visit she is exhausted by the time she arrives. I have a similar one from a different company and I know how much I have enjoyed mine. The problem is that I love this Car Seat Cushion with Strap from Clever Yellow so very much that I want to keep it for myself.In many ways the two cushions are the same EXCEPT this one has a different kind of cover than the one I have. This one is so much easier for me to slide into the car than mine. You see, although she is a very small & petite senior citizens, I am a VERY large, plus sized senior citizen and trying to lift my ... uh... ""haunches"" up and over the other seat is quite difficult whereas it's very easy for her. The one I've used has a velour type cover and this one has a breathable mesh cover.Both will help with the problems we both have. And, although I have never had surgery, I have had quite a few back injuries. We both have problems with our coccyx and need support for the back, hips & leg pain we get from sitting a lot.I have wrapped the strap around the back of the chair so it stays firmly on the seat and I don't have to worry about it sliding off.

"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, Chai Tea. Of all the teas I drink, I think Chai Tea is the most flavorful. As I write this, it is almost winter, it's been a bit warm & humid but as I type, a cold front is coming through. I can feel it even though my home is all closed up in anticipation. Sitting on my desk is a cup of this Chai Tea from Higher-Tea and oooo, it tastes so good! I can hear the wind blowing through the trees, I can smell the the aroma of the multiple spices and I can taste the deliciousness that only Chai tea can have.Alright, alright... I'm in a bit of a romantic mood today.... but that's what the changes of the seasons does for me. And for me, nothing means winter like chai tea.It's that full body flavor that gives you the same energy as a cup of coffee. Although I love to drink this just as it is because I love the creamy, sweet and also peppery aroma & flavor of chai tea, it is the one tea that I will occasionally add honey and lemon to... not to change the flavor but to give me that little bit of added sweetness.If you want a tea that will not only boost your energy, help you lose weight AND taste delicious, I totally & completely recommend this Chai Tea by Higher-Tea. It has so much flavor that most of the time I will use the tea leaves at least 3 times before discarding them.

"Have you ever been to a posh hotel, stepped into the shower, discovered they had a handheld shower head, with adjustable settings, tried it out and had an ""ahhhhhhh, YES!"" moment?Have you ever stayed with friends or family, stepped into the shower, discovered that they had a wall shower head that wasn't handheld, wouldn't adjust, tried it out and had an ""Awwwww phooey!"" moment?Well, with this Handheld Shower Head with Hose and Mount By ShowerMaxx your guests (or even YOU) will experience that posh hotel moment.I got this to put in our guest bathroom. After my husband installed it, I decided to try it out just for fun. Well...... although I love the handheld one in our shower, I am actually quite jealous of our guests. :-)This shower head was EASY for my husband to install. It comes with the attachment so you can still use the stationary shower head and yet add this one. You can turn off one and use the other. Although, I don't know why anyone would want to use the stationary shower head when they have this one that has SIX adjustable sprays to it.It also comes with an extra long hose that is 5.75 ft STRETCHABLE up to 7 ft. (longer than the one in our shower) so it can even be used to shower off kids while they are in the tub. This would be so great to rinse off the shampoo for a child. And, that is part of the reason why I am keeping it in our guest bathroom. 1. My 93 year old mother-in-law likes to sit on a shower chair in the tub and this works perfectly for her. 2. We have a couple of friends who visit us frequently and they have small children. They can get their kids clean without getting themselves soaked. and 3. My 10-year old grandson (who visits us at least 3 times a week) LOVES to use it.Right now my husband has it on the massage mode but if we want, it will be easy to change it to the water saver mode. Oh... and I almost forgot... it comes with the silicone tape you put on it so it won't leak. That means there is nothing else to buy. It is ready to install right out of the box.

"These OVERMAL Chic Women Roses Barrette Hair Clip Hair Pin Claw are fabulous. I got them to give to my granddaughter and will still give them to her but in the meantime, I wore them on a wig at Halloween. I had a long wig and the hair wouldn't stay back out of my eyes. These clips not only kept the hair out of my eyes but they also looked terrific!They are easy to clip onto the hair and they stay clipped until you take them off. The black rosettes are so pretty and will go with any outfit and with any color hair. When I ordered them I had no idea just how great they would be. I could have searched all the malls in town and never found any clips I like as much as these.I truly plan to at least 2 more sets of these. One for my daughter-in-law who has long hair and love to pull it back and one set for me...

I love to serve all types of cheeses from hard to soft. In the past, I have tried to figure out which knife to use for which cheese. Now, I don't have to worry and neither do my guests. If I serve a soft cheese and a hard cheese, both I and my guests know which knife is the best one to use.I love that these are stainless steel which to me means that I can wash them in my dishwasher. (Although I don't see any place that it says that... I just wash anything I can in the dishwasher... lol) And, that the blades are super sharp. They cut any cheese perfectly. If you're trying to find a gift for your friend, co-worker or family, these knives will get you lots of ""thank you's"". And if you're getting these for yourself, not only will you be pleased but your guests will be pleased as well.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"I just love this Rubie's Costume Full Length Hooded Cape Costume (I got red). I didn't wear it for Halloween but I will probably wear it this winter to a winter gala we always attend. It's not exactly a costume party and to me, this cape is not exactly a costume. I can think of many occasions when I can wear this. To our little town's annual Christmas events, to Christmas parties, for Valentine's Day and just plain because I like it. Trust me, it's that cool. The fabric is NOT a cheap fabric. It has just enough weight to make it hang beautifully and enough lightness to it that it flows nicely when you walk.I am a very plus size 5' 7"" and it still fits over my shoulders great. It comes above my ankles with is great for me. My daughter-in-law is a petite 5' 1"" and it does drag the floor.... HOWEVER, if I were to give it to her, I could easily trim the hem to fit her height.... that is, IF she wanted it to not drag the floor.... sometimes having that train effect is desired.No matter where or when I decide to wear this cape...even if I decide to wait until next Halloween...which is probably not gonna happen... I will be proud to wear this. It is 100% polyester & hand washable so I really see myself wearing it lots of times and washing it in between wearings.Although I am a product tester/reviewer, I purchased this product on my own at the same cost at which anyone can buy. No matter how I get a product, I always pretest every one so I can give my honest and unbiased opinion.

"My husband is going to love these Iglove Unisex Touch Screen Knit Gloves Hand Warm for Iphone Ipad Blackberry Samsung HTC and Other Smartphones PDA (One Size) this winter. With his job, he is outside quite a bit and needs to use his phone or another type of touch screen. He is an executive for a company with a lot of 18-wheeler trucks and some of the things he does periodically is to do a spontaneous evaluation inspection of the trucks, visit them while they are onsite and to make sure everything is going smoothly.When it is cold outside, it is impossible for him to do all this while wearing gloves because he has to use a touch screen. Now with these gloves, he can keep his hands warm while still getting the job done.The gloves have a fabric that is sewn into the glove material that makes it so it is sensitive to a touch screen... otherwise a touch screen doesn't work with regular gloves. I have an Android and my husband has an iPhone. I have tested these gloves on both and they work perfectly. Plus, the material on the tips is made so it won't scratch the screen... not even the plastic coating I have on my screen to protect the actual screen from scratching. (It has been my experience that my plastic overlay scratches something awful... but not with these gloves.)The gloves are comfortable for him to wear and they keep his hands warm. This job can sometimes be a dirty job because he has to check all parts of the truck. But these gloves can be hand washed and then simply stretched while they are drying... Although this sounds easy... and it IS... the hard part for me is to get him in the habit to NOT simply throw them in the washing machine. He is used to coming home and doing that. I usually have a washer load of ready to wash dark clothes waiting for him on those days I know he will be checking the trucks. His habit (which is a great one) is to go to the laundry room, take off his dirty clothes, put everything in the washing machine and then put on the robe I keep on a hook for him. Like I said, I need to train him... but he is still trainable. :-)I think it will be worth the extra time for me, knowing his fingers will be warm and he will still be able to do his job efficiently. However, being the lazy housewife I am... I would totally love them if they were totally machine washable & dry-able. :-)I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"For me, tea is the best drink in the world. I love the flavor, the warmth and the healthy benefits of drinking tea. I have many tea favorites and green tea is one of them. There is something about green tea that seems to relax and rejuvenate my system.The Skinny Tea by Higher Tea is NO disappointment. It has a wonderful flavor that I consider to be delicious. I can drink it at anytime during the day because it rejuvenates my body and yet calms it at the same time. I drink a lot of tea....I mean a lot. As other people are drinking their coffee or sodas, I drink tea. This Chinese Green Tea is a loose leaf tea rather than a prepackaged tea. To me, this is the best way to drink teas. And, this Skinny Tea is definitely for weight loss. Among other natural ingredients this Oolong tea contains the root of the dandelion, ginseng,and marshmallow. For flavoring it has cinnamon and fennel seed (which tastes like licorice to me).I never put anything extra in my teas. In my opinion, when you add milk, sweetener or even lemon juice, you lose the real flavor of the tea itself. And the green tea is usually one of the favorites for even the novice to drink without adding anything to it because of the cinnamon & licorice flavors.As I said, I drink a lot of tea and in my opinion, this is one of the best teas I have right now. Full of flavor, healthy ingredients & it's designed to help me lose weight. Love it.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"I have been taking the Natural Diuretic: Water Weight Loss capsules for 15 days. I waited to write my review so I could give a good, educated and honest review. Let me tell you, for me, these are working like magic.I am a senior citizen, plus sized woman on a medicine that has been proven to make you gain weight and trust me, it was almost impossible for me to lose even a pound before. I have now lost 7 1/2 pounds. Thats only a little bit considering how heavy I am BUT when you've done nothing but gain, it's a miracle.I started taking them 2 days before going on a cruise... a strange time, I know, and I did have to make frequent trips to the bathroom. However instead of bloating up in the heat like I normally do, I got smaller and smaller. My clothes didn't actually get loose and fall off but they no longer hurt.I've now been home for over a week and I am continuing to take one capsule a day (I know I can take up to 2 but I'm fine with one). I am also continuing to lose more water weight.I know it's only water but it has encouraged me to eat healthier. Even on the cruise! I ate mostly fish and chicken, asking for the lighter calorie dishes. I don't care much for sweets so that wasn't a problem. Since I've been home, I have been cooking most of my meals and I'm feeling better.It makes me happy to know that these capsules are made in the USA, are made with healthy herbs like dandelions and that they also contain potassium. I know that when I lose weight I need to add potassium to my diet.I am totally happy with my results and plan to take them for a full 60 days. I am also happy that they come with a 100% money back guarantee. It made me feel better about taking them in the first place. However, I won't need that guarantee. A week prior to the time when I run out of these, I will more than likely order another bottle.I was fortunate to receive this product free in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"Although this is probably more suited for a girl, I got this for my 10-year-old grandson. He loves anything ""bricks"". When I gave it to him, he was thrilled. He didn't care what colors they were. He likes all colors. Besides he doesn't have many girls because most of his sets come with guys only. He likes to match them up as dating and married. Also, I knew he would love having the trees, plants and the building.When he gets a kit, the first thing he does is make it exactly as it shows on the box / instructions. Once he has done that, he begins to use his imagination and puts the pieces with other pieces to make something totally different. I am always amazed how his imagination works. He has a ton of these building bricks at his house but I got these for him to play with while he is at my house. He comes over frequently because he lives near by. I've noticed that since I gave this to him, he has been bringing a few more pieces from his home and the display here is growing.I'm glad that he liked this kit and I'm equally glad that these pieces of brick work perfectly with the more popular ""bricks"". Everything seems to be totally interchangeable which makes it so he can interchange each piece with other pieces he has. When I asked him how he liked it, he gave me 2 thumbs up and went back to building. In his world, that's a 5 star rating.I was fortunate to receive this product free in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review.

"I took the D&R - Microfiber Travel, Sports and Yoga Towel with me on our cruise this past weekend and it was awesome. When the cruise would stop at a port, I would carry this towel with me instead of the heavy, bulky ship towel. We knew each place we were going to would have beach chairs or loungers for us to sit in so all we needed was an absorbent towel to use when we showered off. It worked perfectly. Exactly as I thought it would.The 30""x 60"" size is terrific because I could wear it around my shoulders like a scarf or I could wear it around my waist as a skirt. This towel absorbed the water faster than any of those cruise ship towels would have, it also dried faster. While on the cruise, my husband & I went to the pool and I used my Microfiber travel towel, my husband used the ship towel. Guess whose dried fastest? Mine, of course.Now that we are home, I do NOT plan to pack this away until next years' cruises. I plan to use it every time I go to my club indoor pool. I know that I will be the envy of all my friends as we dry off and I'm dry faster.

"These will definitely be my gloves of choice this year. The ZLYC Women Teen Classic Winter Warm Rabbit Fur Hands Wrist Fingerless Gloves are exactly what they say they are... warm, rabbit..etc. PLUS they are comfortable.I'm a firm believer that if your palms and wrists are warm, your body will be warmer. So, these should be wonderful for helping to keep my body warmer. When I wear gloves with fingers in them, they seem to cut off the circulation to my fingers and I find that most of the time, I take the gloves off so I can warm up my fingers. I also, put my gloved hands in my pockets to try to warm my fingers. So having the fingerless gloves is going to a be a big plus for me.I have two other times when I'm going to be glad to have the fingerless gloves. One is while driving and the other while using my cell phone or even my home computer. When I drive, I don't feel comfortable wearing gloves because I'm afraid the wheel will slip too much. I usually end up taking them off. With these gloves, I won't have to do that. Neither will I have to take them off when I need to use my phone. I will have the perfect touch for my phone and still be able to keep my palms and wrists warm.Finally, my computer. I sit at my desk most of the day, every day doing my work and in the winter months, my hands get cold. In the past, I have crocheted fingerless gloves for myself but I'm no longer able to do that. I don't like to up the heat because even though my hands are cold, the house is usually quite warm and upping the heat would not only make it too hot but would waste a lot of energy needlessly. Have you ever tried to type while wearing gloves???? Impossible??? Not with these great gloves from ZYLC.Oh... I must NOT forget to mention the color. They are red, beautiful, cheerful, classy, glamorous red! They will be great for any occasion from football game to fancy party. I wear a larger than 7 size glove and these gloves fit me nicely. Not too big and not too small. I believe they will fit a variety of sizes because of the rabbit fur lining which spills out over the fingers. They are quite festive as well as useful.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"The Probelle Toenail Stainless Steel Straight Design Clippers, from Probelle are sharp, easy to use and cut the nail perfectly straight.... leaving no rough edges. This is almost a miracle for someone like me who has thin nails that seem to grow in layers sort of like the flaky layer biscuits. It is almost impossible for me to clip or even file them evenly because they clip one layer at a time. That is not the case with these clippers.In the past, most clippers I used would leave shreds of nail behind. I would then have to file them to get rid of the shreds which made them rough instead of smooth. It was an endless process. Since I have been using these pink clippers, I haven't had that problem even once.I also like that the pick silicone cover helps to protect the sharp blades in my makeup bag. They stay closed and don't get stuck on other items in the bag. AND that pink cover also can serve to catch the clipped nails. It doesn't work every time for me but I love when it does because that means far fewer pieces of sharp nail I have to pick up all over everywhere.I can use these straight edge nail clippers with or without the pink cover and that makes if very convenient for me. The lever used to press the clipper blades together are super easy to use, the ball part that gets squeezed seems to be strong enough to support whatever amount needed to clip even the hardest nail... which as it happens, my husband has very thick and hard nails and it works for him as well. Although... I'm pretty sure he won't be using them... as I said, I like my PINK nail clippers. lol...I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"Such fun!!! I took the entire box of NSFW Fortune Cookies: Inappropriate Edition (Explicit Adult Content) Gift Box (20 Count) from Greenfire Custom Fortune Cookies with me on our cruise to Mexico that we took this weekend and they were a HUGE HIT!!!!My husband & I were on the cruise with friends from a business networking group. We go with them every year so I know most of them pretty well and knew they would love them. At the first of two parties they had onboard for us, I put them on a table with a note that said, ""Not Suitable For Work Fortune Cookies. Take One At Your Own Discretion."" Well, they were gone in no time! :-) I told you I know this group. lolThey loved the fortunes. I won't spoil the surprise for you as to what they said, but it was a variety of ""fortunes"". Each one got a reaction of a Hummm... or an Oh, my... MOST of them got a reaction of LOOK AT THIS ONE! And all of them got a HUGE LAUGH.And, they loved the taste of the cookies. It was a great ice breaker for the group because some of us hadn't seen each other in a year and it got people to talking.

"This is one of those times when I wish I knew how to do a video on my phone... I'm not sure that regular photos can do proper justice to the excitement my grandson exhibited when he saw, opened and rode this Rimable Foldable Maxi Kick Scooter with LED Light up Wheelsfrom RIMABLE.He had no idea I had gotten it for him but the second he saw it, he knew it was something to ride when he comes to my house. He is an active yet smaller sized 10-year-old and this fits him perfectly.The scooter was out of that box almost faster than I could get a photo. It was so easy to put together, too. He didn't even look at the photos on the box... He immediately put the two parts together.... the scooter base and the adjustable handle which slide together...and, he began to ride it all around the house. I let him do that because we were having a storm outside. I don't think that took 2 minutes. It took me back to the Christmas when his dad got a riding toy. His dad & I stayed up until 3 in the morning trying to put it together all the little parts. The next morning when our son got on it, the wheel fell off. lolAs soon as the storm was over, he wanted to ride it outside. I was concerned because it was very dark and we have a steep driveway. He and my husband pointed out that he would be safe because of the rear brake. As he went down the drive, he stopped quickly and said, ""See?"" He rode it down our driveway and onto the sidewalk. He was watching the lights light up and was saying, ""Cool, Awesome & All Right!"" he whole time. Before he came into the house, he quickly folded it up so he could bring it back into the house without getting the now wet wheels on the floor. (He's a great kid.) You can also see how easy it is to fold up and he had no trouble at all carrying in while it was folded. After he finally came back inside, I showed him the photos and he said, ""Wow! The back wheels light up, too?He then proceeded to explain to me that it is one that you use your weight to make turns... like a ""cycle"" and that it rides super smooth. He said it rides low to the ground... like a ""low-rider"". And then he came over to me and gave me a huge hug and said, ""Thank you."" Aww yes, he is a great kid. The next day he asked if he could come over again because he wanted to ride it again. Yay!

"The Idson Muscle Roller Stick for Athletes-18 Inches Body Massage Sticks Tools, is one of the best, if not the best, muscle pain relievers I've ever used.I have fibromyalgia which means that I have wide-spread muscle pain every day. I have kept this roller on my desk in my home office because that is where I spend more than 8 hours a day working. About once an hour or even half hour, I reach for this wonderful ""magic wand"", roll it across whatever part of my body is hurting and within a few minutes, the cramping / pain / knot / or twitching is relieved. It is amazing to me that this roller can do all that.The handles stay in place and the rest (the part in the middle) move as you roll it over your muscles. There are 9 individual rollers that work independent of one another. As it rolls over your skin, they move. Each roller is thicker in the middle and has 9 notches around it. This makes it so you get a lot of individual things rolling over those aches each time you roll the entire stick. It is difficult for me to roll it in some places but my husband is always willing to help...so long as I return the favor.I am using this to help remove the knots and pain in my fibromyalgia body and if it helps me, I know it will help the athlete as well.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"If you take a look at the photos, you will see what a toenail looks like MONTHS after getting an infection from getting a pedicure at my local nail salon... my podiatrist says the nails will probably never be the same. The big toenail will never again totally adhere to the skin beneath it so I have to keep it trimmed short. I lost the toenail next to it and it is finally growing back in. I will NEVER get another ""professional"" pedicure again!In the meantime, I have had several types of clippers. Most of them worked from okay to very nice but none of them were as easy for me to use as this Probelle Toenail Nipper Stainless Cobalt Professional Grade Tool has worked. I realize that my toes don't look fabulous but at least they are finally looking ""presentable"". I am now at the stage where I just MIGHT wear a pair of sandals again. I refused to do that before.This pair of ""nippers"" are easy to hold onto. They don't slip & I can use my whole hand to clip, not just my finger tips. I have found that rather than trying to clip the entire nail at one time, that these work best when I am clipping them corner to corner and then toward the middle. I don't know if I'm just not holding my mouth correctly but that's the best way they work for me.THe inside of the clippers has a curved, almost rounded part that grasps hold of the nail and will clip even the hardest nail. There is a lever-like piece on the inside part of the handle that will move up or down. The down position is for storage. The up position has a spring-like action so as you press on the handles & clip, the handles pop back out ready for the next clip action.These are not the little fingernail clippers.

"These cookies are DELICIOUS!!! I got a trial sample which contained 4 of the NSFW Fortune Cookies from Greenfire Products. They came in a small box just big enough for them and a bit of added packing. Not one of them was broken or even chipped.I saved them to take to our best friend's house. He & his wife invited us to stay a weekend to help him celebrate his birthday. After dinner, we each took a fortune. We followed the instructions.... we kept our fortunes a secret & then during the rest of the conversation at the dinner table, we each tried to work our quote into without the others catching on.

"My daughter was surprised to find that I had placed my Eparè Automatic Soap Dispenser in the bathroom rather than the kitchen but in my opinion, and in my home, it is needed in the bathroom more. She was worried that my grandkids would use up all the soap playing with it. Well first of all, my oldest grandson is 18 and my youngest is 10 but evenso, if having this in my bathroom will encourage 4 boys and one girl to wash their hands more often after being in the bathroom, I don't care how much soap they use.Basically, my kitchen is my domain and except when we are cooking together and I make sure they each wash their hands before helping me cook, I'm pretty much the only one who uses the soap in there. And, I'm pretty good about disinfecting the soap dispenser in there... but in the bathroom, I have no control.I have, however, noticed the clean smell of soap on their hands many times as they leave the bathroom. I then know that they are practicing good hygiene here and hope it will encourage them to practice it elsewhere.Oh, and about the soap dispenser itself. It works exactly as it should. It requires 4 AA batteries (not included), the batteries are easy to insert, there is a wide enough opening on the top so I can fill it without wasting a drop, and once you press the button on the top, you can go away and not worry about it. It will be ready for whatever size hands need cleaning. All they have to do is place a hand under the spout, let it dispense the soap, and they never have to touch it. Also, I haven't noticed any leaking of soap from it. I am totally please with it.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.

"Yep. This is just what I wanted. I have used this Premium Microfiber Towel Designed for Travel, Sports & Outdoors from Wazzala every day since I got it and I haven't been camping, hiking or even left home for anything other than going to the grocery store.Actually, the first time I used it was on my desk. Yep... my desk. After I opened the package, I placed it on my desk so I could look at it, feel it and get a general awareness of it. As the day went on, it stayed there and when I brought in my cup of hot tea and promptly spilled it all over my desk (thankfully it did not get on my computer) I used the large blue microfiber towel to clean up everything. It got everything... even soaked up what had gone on the floor and into my carpet. I then used the OTHER end of the towel (yep I still had some dry parts of the towel) to wipe down the papers that had been on my desk. I was totally relieved to know that not only did the surface of my desk survive but so did the papers.I was tempted to leave them there for just such happenings but decided to try it out as a towel. I washed them that night and the next morning I used them both in my shower and at my sink. This is the softest and most absorbent towel I have ever used PLUS it folds up into almost ""nothing"".... I will be taking this with me on our cruise to Mexico soon. Yes, they have towels on the ship that I can take to the beach with me but I did that last year and by the time my husband & I swapped carrying two heavy towels, we were worn out. Now, the two of us can share this one towel, and not have to worry about the weight.It dries quickly, so I can take it to the pool on ship if I want. Then, once the cruise is over, I will be able to take it wherever I want that I think it will help....even letting it sit on my desk to clean up the messes I make. :-)I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion.

"If you like shiny things, sparkly things, and sequins, you are going to LOVE this 18"" Home Decor Sequin Throw Pillow Cover Pillow Case from AMAZLINEN as much as I do. The sequins are sewn on perfectly, the seams are solid and the hidden zipper zips nicely. Even the back of this pillow case looks classy. I got the gold color and I do love it but I'm pretty sure that I will be buying another color or two before the holidays.The last 3 months of the year is the time when I like to ""glitz"" up my house and these pillow cases are perfect. I like to change out the cases as it grows closer to the new year and then I am done with glitz. I want my home to go back to ""normal"". Any one of these pillow covers will do just that.In the past, I tried using glittery pillows. Oh, they glittered allright... allllllll over my house...in my carpet....into the sofa cushions...onto the clothing of anyone who sat near them and even into the food of my guests. ARrrrrrggg!!!! I'm still vacuuming up glitter dust from last year. With these sequin covers I won't have to worry about that at all. They zip onto my 16-18"" pillows easily, stay put and I don't have to worry about the glitter dust fairy hanging around for ever! When I am through with them, I will just fold them up, put the back into the bag they came in and poof! No more shinny left hanging around.Although.......

"This is a fabulous sexy lace mask. When I ordered it I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. The fabric of the lace is soft enough that it doesn't rub on the face. It lays pretty flat...even when I smile. It covers the upper part of my face all the way to the hairline which is excellent because when I wear this I will also be wearing a wig and this definitely helps to hide that hard line that I always get at the hairline where my skin ends and the wig begins.There are 2 ties, one on each side, that go from the side to the back so you can tie it in a bow in the back. I will be putting that part underneath my wig because with a wig it works really well that way. The eye openings are large enough for very large eyes and yet if you have small eyes, you can simply add a bit more makeup to your eyes and it will still look beautiful.I will be wearing this for a costume party where we must wear a mask and personally, I usually hate masks because they become so bothersome, they scratch, they pull up on the back of my head. BUT Outop Sexy Lace Eyes Mask for Masquerade Party Fancy Dress will not be doing that. It will be staying in place, keeping me comfortable, cool and able to smile.

"The Logan Vibrator adult toy for women from Pink B.O.B, works well and the ridges on the sides are quite nice because if you move it up and down, it creates a rubbing affect as the vibrations work. You can turn the speed from low to high. I personally like the higher speed the best but I can certainly see how some would like the lower speeds especially when you want something low and slow to last a long time.The inside of this has the dark pink and the outside is a clear, soft silicone making it unique in the way it looks. And, the softness of the outer covering makes it soft on the inside of you. It measures a full 6 1/2"" not counting the part you wouldn't insert. This is plenty long enough to reach all those exciting parts. Plus, if you want to take a bath or shower with it, you can because it is fully waterproof.

"Fortunately, this medium size belt fits my son. I say fortunately because it is too big for my daughter-in-law and too small for either my husband or myself. I also say fortunately because he absolutely loves it. He goes to the gym at least 5 times a week to workout lifting weights & running on the treadmill. While he is there, he likes to keep his phone close by but until now he couldn't find anything that worked for him.He wanted something that would work both while he was lifting weights and while he was running. The FitBelt -Premium Running Belt & Fitness workout belt for women and men is just what he wanted. It is comfortable for him while he is lifting weights and doesn't ride up like some of the others he has used. And then when he switches over to running on the treadmill, he doesn't have to readjust it. His phone & keys do not bounce up and down. They stay where they are.It is also great because, of course, he sweats a lot doing both of these activities and he can wash his belt and it dries quickly. He is wearing it every day.

"In the past, EVERY TIME I shaved my legs, I wound up with unsightly bumps. Thankfully, I wear long pants most of the time. :-)  My husband gets a red rash-like bumps on his face sometimes when he shaves his beard.

I am so thankful to have this.I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a lot of products, but I am NOT allergic to this.

"I haven't slipped once since I got this Yoga Towel by NamaStay. No, I don't do Hot Yoga but I definitely get hot & sweaty when I do my yoga. I'm a plus size ""hot mama"" who lives in the hot part of central Texas. Most of the time I like to do my yoga outside on my cement patio in the early mornings to do my yoga and talk about hot & humid!!! Oh my goodness.I seldom take my mat outside because the cement has eaten up a couple of them as they slide across it. This yoga mat does NOT slide, even when I get it soaking from my maneuvers. When I am done, I hang it on a hook to let it dry. I then toss it into my washing machine and it is ready for the next time.There have been many times when I have taken it with me to the indoor pool where I belong. I use it as my towel to dry off with and also put it on the seat of my car to absorb the excess wet from my suit. I find it is much, much better than using a regular towel.I got the charcoal color one and I really do like it because it doesn't show dirt very easily however, the next one I buy will probably be the coral or the purple simply because I like those colors so much.

"I love tea and drink it like some coffee lovers drink their coffee. I usually have between 3 - cups of hot tea a day along with a powdered tea I like to drink cold. I also love all different flavors of tea. I actually haven't found a tea I don't like.But no matter how many different teas I drink in a day at least one of them is Earl Grey. There is just something about that Bergamot flavor that relaxes and rejuvenates me. And this Earl Grey Tea, Citrusy & Tangy, 100% Pure Black Tea blended with rich oil of Bergamot, Loose Leaf from Golden Tips does not disappoint! It has a fresh taste that those ""grocery store teas"" can begin to compete with. I got my 3.53 oz of this tea 10 days ago and the bag says the month of picking was only 4 months ago. I don't see how you can get much fresher than that unless you make your own. I have no desire to make my own so this tea is the very best choice for me.I kept trying to get a photo of the beautiful color of the tea but I would forget & drink the tea before I had a chance.

"I really didn't think I needed a privacy screen. My office is in my home. I don't have any co-workers. Just me...sitting at my computer about 8-10 hours a day all day long. Nope, I didn't think I needed one. When I sit at my computer, I am facing the wall, the window is to my back. If someone walked up behind me, I would see them on my screen because they pass between it and the glare on my screen from the light behind me...Oh... then I got it. I didn't think I wanted it on there permanently so I just leaned it up against the screen of my laptop. I don't have a desktop so I don't have to try to make it ""fit"". I just leaned it up against it. One thing I noticed was that my screen was a bit darker than before and that there were little lines and it was difficult for me to see. After examining it and looking at the picture instructions I found out that there was a sheet of clear plastic on both sides that I needed to remove. Once I did that, I once again leaned it up to my screen and when I pushed on the privacy filter, I could see great but it didn't stay close to the screen when I moved my hand away. So, I decided I should adhere it to my screen afterall.I will admit that it took me a while to figure out how to use the adhesive tabs to hold it in place but once I did that I discovered something amazing.... I no longer had the glare from the window behind me on my screen. I no longer have to close the blinds when the sun is on that side of the house & I no longer can tell when someone has come up behind me. :-) That's another reason why I'm glad I have a privacy screen.

"About a year ago, I decided that doing cleanses and detoxes was something that I not only needed to do but wanted to do. I have used quite a few in that time and I believe that gradually, my health is improving. However, I have been of the opinion that the word ""detox"" means it tastes bad, upsets my stomach and basically... hurts. What a surprise I have had with this Detox Tea By Higher Tea. Don't get me wrong... it is DEFINITELY a colon cleanse... but that is one reason why I need a detox.I am a senior citizen and I have spent most of my life filling my body with toxins. I have eaten all the wrong foods, drank all the wrong drinks and even smoked for 16 years of my life. The past 15 years I have followed the advice of a ""doctor""... he truly is a certified doctor... who told me to quit eating any fruits or vegetables and if I did, I needed to eat only canned vegetables. And, to eat no whole wheat... only enriched white bread. I could eat all the beef and chicken I wanted but only a certain amount of fish and most of that was canned.At first I did feel some better...I really did...but as the years went by and I got progressively worse, he told me I was going through very normal things... that it was just all to do with aging. I'm not blaming him... I had lots of friends and relatives who told me he was wrong but... I chose to believe him.A year ago, I realized that this was not working as I watched my husband, friends and older family members walk circles around me. That is when I began detoxes. I am slowly but surely getting rid of the toxins in my body after years of abuse.Having shared all that... The Detox Tea from Higher Tea is delicious. I love drinking it. I can smell and taste all the wonderful ingredients... like the licorice, the cinnamon, the ginger and even the sage. There are other ingredients but those are the flavors I can taste the best. Now, I also need you to understand that when I began drinking this tea I was already drinking other teas. I drink several cups of hot and cold teas a day. While drinking these teas, I have given up most of my wine drinking and have been eating more fruits and vegetables... not because I HAVE to but because I want to.However, once I started drinking the detox tea, I could really feel a boost in my metabolism... I could also feel the colon cleanse...but it doesn't hurt me like other colon cleanses have in the past. AND, I have been losing weight and feeling better. So, if cleaning out my colon is what it takes to get me on the road to a balanced digestive system a higher metabolism and an actual craving for staying on a healthy diet.... then I am all for it.I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion.

"""London Falling"" opens with two undercover police -- the cynical and  crooked Costain and the earnest and not-entirely-open homosexual Sefton -- being told by their boss Quill that their long and largely fruitless investigation of powerful crime lord Rob Toshack must end tonight. The police successfully lower the boom on Toshack, but he slips through their fingers yet again, this time when he dies hideously and inexplicably in a police interrogation room, right in front of Quill. As Quill, Sefton, Costain, and their intelligence contractor Lisa Ross comb through the remains of Toshack's organization, they stumble into an occult ritual that leaves them cursed with the ability to see into the dark magical dimension that underlies London's mundane reality. Encouraged by Quill's boss, this mismatched team must conquer their fear and loathing in order to bring down the evil creature that fueled Toshack's violent reign ... and ultimately brought him down.I was not expecting such a bleak, dread-ful, and horror-ific book from Paul Cornell. I didn't think ""London Falling"" was going to be an imitation of Neal Gaiman's mostly-whimsical Neverwhere -- another novel about an supernatural world below the surface of London -- but Cornell's fantasy is as about as dark as they come. Without appealing characters and with a plodding pace, I found the book difficult to finish. Nevertheless, it's imaginative and well-written, and I will probably read the second book in the ""Shadow Police"" series, ""The Severed Streets.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MO5AOP3ORKFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF62ET4#wasThisHelpful","R2MO5AOP3ORKFB","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melissa F. Olson's Scarlet Bernard series got off to a slow start and, though the later books are better than the first, Olson painted herself into a corner by, among other things, destroying virtually every relationship in the main character's life, including the character's own relationship with her life. Olson probably made a good decision when she decided to set her new Boundary Magic in the same universe but give it a fresh set of characters and a new locale. While Allison “Lex” Luther's experience as a traumatized female Iraq war vet who also happens to be a witch doesn't exactly make her the girl next door, it does make her more understandable and relatable than ""null"" crime scene scrubber Scarlet Bernard.In fact, with Lex in her home town of Boulder and her community of sometimes-friendly/sometimes scary witches and vampires, Olson seems to have consciously or unconsciously modeled her new series on Kat Richardson's Greywalker series, with her tough PI protagonist Harper Blaine, her home town of Seattle, and her hot and cold relations with witches and vampires. Both women see ghosts, both women have died multiple times, and both women have to delve into the histories of their home towns in order to achieve their goals. My point is not that the Boundary Magic series is a rip-off; actually, I think that Olson has picked a good model and is doing well with it. Furthermore, I think it's fair to say at this point that Olson's work is at least on par with Richardson's.I haven't said anything yet about the plot of ""Boundary Lines."" It's a bit convoluted, but the upshot is that somebody or something is fooling around with the magic in Colorado, the potential consequences are dire, and in order to prevent the world from coming to an end (at least in a small way), Lex must heal past wounds, work with her friends, and gain new powers. There's some romance, some revisiting of past traumas, some best-forgotten nonsense with the police (best forgotten because it's not handled well by Olson), some action involving werewolves, vampires, witches, ghosts, and a giant people-eating monster, and and some not great/not terrible use of Colorado history to provide a sense of place and context. Not everything works, but when you take it all together, it's a satisfying read. Recommended to those who have followed Olson's work so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZO2MGCCGVTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXX5BAS#wasThisHelpful","RYZO2MGCCGVTS","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The high ratings this set has received from some people will probably get your hopes up, but ... you get what you pay for. The quality of the tools is fair. The quality of the case is poor.

"Ramez Naam's Nexus Trilogy is probably the best science fiction treatment to date of the emergence of the ""posthuman."" Unlike some authors, Naam does not assume that AI leads unconditionally to catastrophic singularity (as in Charles Stross' Accelerando), nor does he simply wave his hands and shoot off to a far future where posthumanity is an established fact. Naam wants us to confront the choices we face as humans in an age where technological mind alteration, mind connection, mind control, and non-human minds are all possibilities. His characters do make choices -- sometimes foolish choices, sometimes paranoid choices, and sometimes angry choices -- but none of them are simple or necessarily morally right or rationally correct. If his writing and characterization are not entirely top shelf, they're still quite good. The result is a thoughtful, well-paced, well-sustained techno-thriller that should be able to reach a broad audience. I recommend the entire trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10145P675VM01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOZI7FM#wasThisHelpful","R10145P675VM01","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SoundTouch Controller Android app allows you to take control of the relatively modest network capabilities of your Bose SoundTouch system. You can use it to turn on your SoundTouch device, control the volume, pair SoundTouch devices, and connect your SoundTouch device to Internet radio, a small selection of Internet apps (limited to Deezer, iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify), or your local music library. The interface is initially confusing, but doesn't take long to master. Power and volume are easy to figure out. If you have multiple systems that you want to pair, the first device you choose becomes the host, and the second (or third, etc.) becomes a client. Setting up a multiple-system connection can be frustrating because the systems (in my experience) are so slow to respond that you may give up and try again ... only to find the first attempt beginning to work just before it is terminated by the second attempt. (That's probably not the app's fault.) Setting up the 6 presets (yes, that's all you get, for no sane reason) is not difficult, but for reasons I'm not certain of, they don't always ""take"". Presets can be internet radio stations, one of the built-in apps, your music library, or Bluetooth (I think; I haven't tried making Bluetooth a preset).The app design is not as intuitive as I would like, but it's not terrible, and it does have a more professional look to it than many other product-specific apps. My three-star rating is less a reflection on the app itself than a judgment on the (slow) speed of pairing and on the limitations of the Bose SoundTouch system, including the small number of built-in apps, the small number of presets, and the inability to use Bluetooth to play whatever you'd like on the system. (E.g., you cannot play Prime Music on your SoundTouch system even if it's installed on your phone or computer.) Regardless, you *must* install this if you have a SoundTouch system and want to take advantage of its network capabilities.N.B. This app is not a substitute for your physical Bose remote. For example, if you have a Bose Wave IV with SoundTouch, you can use this app to turn it on or off, to change volume settings, and to select SoundTouch presets, but you cannot use it to switch to CD, change tracks on the CD, switch to AM/FM radio, or do any radio tuning.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VGCCLKH8ZONB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4VJMMU#wasThisHelpful","R2VGCCLKH8ZONB","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife has been the main one using the Gaiam Beginner's Barre Kit, so here are her impressions (edited & augmented by me):It's always nice to have new exercises to do, and new equipment makes it easy to vary your routine. This barre kit is an inexpensive way to add new options to your daily or weekly routines. It includes a small, uninflated rubber ball, a needle for inflating the ball (pump not included), a rubber resistance band with handles, a simple guide with five exercises, and a URL for two free exercise videos. It is easy to use, and it doesn't take up a lot of room (even when inflated) for storage.The guide and the videos were helpful in showing me some good exercises to do, and they sparked ideas of other ways to use the equipment. For example, I'm such a literal thinker that I only thought about using the band solely by holding the handles with my hands. But you can also use the handles on your feet! Or you can hold the band in the middle! (I'm short, so I already thought of putting a knot into the band to shorten it when necessary.) The exercises aren't too hard or crazy (this IS a ""beginner's"" kit), but I still felt them, and you can certainly come up with your own ways to make it harder if you want.N.B. The provided URL for the exercise videos didn't work. I called the toll free customer service number on the guide, and the friendly and helpful representatives there sent me a working link.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3M5TEY9BW9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I7C1CY#wasThisHelpful","R2T3M5TEY9BW9C","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Adam Rakunas's ""Windswept"" is a fun, fast-moving, and suspenseful sci-fi novel inspired by the ""one last job"" crime genre (a la ""The Italian Job). Clever, pushy, manipulative, but good-hearted union recruiter Padma Mehta needs just one more handful of new members to earn the credit she needs to fulfill her dearest aspiration and buy the Windswept rum refinery. When a competing recruiter uses underhanded methods to steal her most recent batch of recruits, Padma gets desperate. She takes a tip from one of the most thoroughly disreputable characters she knows -- beginning a rollercoaster succession of temporary successes and setbacks that leave the reader constantly wondering what will happen next.Padma lives on planet Santee, a agro-industrial backwater known mostly as an interstellar truck stop and bio-diesel exporter. On Santee, there is an uneasy peace between the WalWa corporate combine and the Union that the workers who process local crops and turn grain into fuel. (It's not clear why the big corporations haven't been able to grind the Union into the dust like they have in our world; we just have to take it for granted that the Union has more leverage than is apparent.) Most of the Union members, including Padma herself, are ""breaches"" -- men and women who take advantage of the stopover at Santee to flee their interstellar transports and break their contracts of indentured servitude with the big corporations. Unfortunately for these people, Santee is becoming less and less relevant to galactic affairs, and economic opportunities are disappearing. And, as Padma will eventually learn, some of the locals resent the corporations and the declining status of Santee enough to take drastic action.The One Last Job and Evil Inc. tropes are not exactly news, so what Rakunas does to keep this novel at fresh is to give it a frantic pace, inject a lot of unexpected goofiness, and lean a lot more heavily on Solidarity Forever than I can recall ever seeing in a sci-fi novel. He also gives Padma more depth than her initial actions appear to indicate; her ambitions have much less to do with wealth than with maintaining her sanity. Furthermore, while jaded Padma may think she knows how everything works, she is in for almost as many surprises as the reader.Bottom line: This is a fast and fun book that reflects current concerns about corporate dominance, ecology, human, social, and economic rights, and racial/ethnic diversity without ever getting preachy or particularly heavy. It's not going to earn many brownie points with the Sad Puppies (look it up), but too bad for them. Recommended.N.B.

At least when new and sharp, like it is now, it does a fair job of trimming.

"It's been a while since I read ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"" but if recall the author's views correctly, a Bose radio is like a BMW motorcycle. They're both expensive and polished and known for their elegance and smoothness. You can find something else that does the job equally well, but nothing else will deliver the sense of style or the level of confidence that comes with the Bose or BMW. The best reason to buy a Bose is *because* it's a Bose.That said, the Bose Wave SoundTouch Music System IV is a nice package. It looks nice and it sounds nice. It plays AM/FM radio, it plays CDs (just one at a time, slot-loaded), and it can connect with other devices using wi-fi or Bluetooth (via the SoundTouch base). It also has a remote control and can be used as an alarm clock (a feature I have not tried). I have no idea how many watts its amp puts out, but it can pump more volume than you would think, without noticeable distortion. When Bose says that the Wave IV delivers ""Lifelike, room filling sound"" they're not exaggerating -- at least about the ""room filling"" part. As for ""lifelike"" ... that's a tall order for any system, and it's not one this system can fill. The Bose IV sounds great for a kitchen or bedroom radio, and it can be the life of the party in a pinch, but it will not blow you away with solid lows, sparkling highs, or incredible levels of detail.A word about SoundTouch: This is Bose's new system for filling your whole house/apartment with sound. Using Bose's SoundTouch app (available for Android, Mac, iPhone, and Windows), you can link two or more Bose SoundTouch systems together, using one of of the systems as a sound-generating host and the others as clients. I have two SoundTouch devices (this is and the Bose SoundTouch 520 Home Theater System) and I have joined them together more than once to deliver music throughout the bottom floor of my apartment. (Note that range within the home is not an issue; the linkage occurs via wi-fi, so as long as your devices are on the same network, you should be OK.) The other system doesn't even need to be on when you initiate the link; you can do it all through the app. Unfortunately, the linkage process is on the slow side, and the app is ... less user-friendly than one would hope.) Once the link is set up, however, it's quite cool to control all that sound from your phone or computer. N.B. While you can connect to the Wave IV from your phone or other devices using Bluetooth, you cannot connect to Bluetooth speakers from the Wave IV. If you want to broadcast sound all over the house, you will need to buy other Bose SoundTouch devices.Additional details: (1) The remote is easy to use, but it's also tiny and mandatory. Tiny = easy to lose, and mandatory = there are no controls on the unit besides on and off so you better not lose the remote. (2) The app allows you to create music six presets for the Wave IV. (Why six and not ten or several dozen? I have no idea.) I have three radio stations (via the Internet) set up on mine right now, plus a Pandora channel. The app allows you to access Deezer, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, and at least one local music library (i.e., on a PC or NAS drive) natively, in the sense that you don't have to involve any other device to run these services. (3) N.B. You can't determine what you will hear on these services without your phone, tablet, or laptop, because the Wave IV has no controls; if I want to change Pandora channels or hear a specific artist on Spotify, I will have to pull out my phone. (4) The ability to send sound to the system from your computer has limits. You can play music via Windows Media Player or iTunes, but you may not be able to hear the sound on your computer (I've had mixed experiences with this, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to work), and you cannot simply play sound in a web browser and have that relayed to the system. (5) Like so many slot-loading CD players, the one on my Wave IV is slow to load, makes scary noises when it's loading, and isn't guaranteed to load even a brand-new CD on the first try. (6) You can turn the unit off with a touch on the top. This is nice when you can't find the remote or left it on the other side of the room and you need immediate silence. (7) The Wave IV is compact, but it's not small, and Bose says that it performs best when you keep it away from corners, don't back it up flush with walls, and spread out the power cord (for FM reception). This means you might have some difficulty placing it properly, especially if you want to use it in the kitchen. (8) Broadcast radio reception was so-so, and the Wave IV does not receive broadcast HD radio; if you want to hear HD radio, you will have get it over the Internet. If you can -- I haven't tried yet. (8) There are no tone controls. At all. If you want more treble or bass, you will have to control them at the sound source (i.e., the app on your phone, if it has an EQ).Bottom line: Nobody would turn down a Bose Wave IV as a gift; that would be nuts! If you're shopping for a sound system, however, you will need to think through a number of issues, from whether you have a suitable space for the Wave IV, whether you really want to spend that much money, and whether you're interested in buying additional SoundTouch devices to fill up your home. (Bose uses proprietary technology, so you can only link the Wave IV to other Bose devices.)  All else being equal, if you can afford it and you value the simplicity and elegance and general BMW-ness of a Bose system, go for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZ5MZDY7WW78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6M50#wasThisHelpful","R3NZ5MZDY7WW78","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the Bose SoundTouch 520 Home Theater System for nearly a month. This is not a great surprise, but t's a vast improvement over TV speakers alone (I have a LG 65UB9200 65-Inch TV). I honestly don't have enough experience with similar systems to make apples-to-apples comparisons, but I will share my impressions of the system.SHORT VERSION: I'm very happy to have the SoundTouch 520. The subwoofer gives the system heft, the surround effects are good, the ability to play Internet sources is great, and the capability of sharing music with another system in the house (I have a Bose Wave SoundTouch music system IV) is cool. The sound quality is generally good, but there are weaknesses in the high bass/low midrange and high treble ranges. The system is less adjustable and configurable than most audiophiles and techies would like, with, e.g., no graphic equalizer or program/music type presets but only bass and treble controls. The SoundTouch app allows you to configure 6 radio station or app presets, while my car radio gives my 30 presets for FM alone. In other words, this is a system that will especially appeal to people who value compactness, simple setup and operation, seamlessness, and good design, and don't mind spending a few extra bucks and being locked into a proprietary system. It is less well-suited to tinkerers, eclectic mix-and-matchers, spec junkies, and those who value economy over elegance.OVERVIEW: The SoundTouch 520 consists of a central console, a wireless (wi-fi/Bluetooth) attachment to the console, a wireless subwoofer, four right-left front-back speakers (all the same), a center speaker (slightly larger), a ""universal"" remote control, and a bunch of wires. The console has 4 HDMI inputs to connect to devices like your cable box and DVD player, an HDMI output to the TV, and three non-HDMI inputs for older devices (Coaxial audio input (digital), Optical audio input (digital), R-L audio input (analog)) that can be accessed through AUX. It does not include any stands or mounting hardware, but it does include a special headset that can be used to adjust audio settings to best suit the room. Everything is controlled through the console, which includes a 5.1 channel amplifier of undisclosed power (Bose does not publish amplifier characteristics), can connect to the Internet via wi-fi, and can connect to your cell phone via wi-fi or Bluetooth. It has a small number of built-in apps for common services like Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio that it can run without an external device, can access many radio stations over the Internet, and can stream from your phone, tablet, or computer, but it does not include an AM/FM radio receiver. It can also operate as a ""host"" or client to another SoundTouch device in your home, meaning that it can play sound on the other device or can be made to play whatever is already playing on that device.SETUP: The system is easy to unpack and assemble, though you might have some difficulties figuring out where to place the small front and rear speakers. The quick-start sheet and the larger manual are both clear and easy to read. Note that the speaker wires are proprietary, which means if they're too short, you will need to buy longer ones (assuming they offer them) from Bose. The SoundTouch app is easy to find online and download to your Android phone or Windows computer. (I don't have an iPhone or Mac to test, but apps are also available for those.) Getting the system to interface with your phone is not difficult, but the app can be a little puzzling at first. The remote is easy to configure but my not do everything you'd like. It supports the HDMI CEC device standard, but I couldn't get that to work with my TV or DVR/cable box. Instead, I had to look up codes. The TV works OK, but it's lacking one crucial feature for the DVR -- ""go back,"" as in ""I'm done looking at episodes of 'NCIS', let me see what else I have recorded."" It also lacks the capability to turn everything on or off at once; it can do power, but only one device at a time.SOUND: Like I said above, the SoundTouch 520 generally sounds pretty good. Volume is not a problem in our mid-sized living room (but it might be a problem for the neighbors!). The subwoofer gives you that boomy theater sound, but the upper bass/lower midrange is lacking. In other words, it works better with explosions than with drums or cellos. The high end does not stand out particularly, but that's not necessarily a flaw. The system can give you a good surround experience, but that depends in part on where you're sitting (inevitably). Overall presence is OK but not great. The system sound can be configured for the room (using manual controls or the Adaptiq device), but it is not very adjustable for different types of music (no graphic equalizer, no classical or rock presets), and there are no special effects (e.g., concert hall sound vs. small club sound).INTERFACE: A really obvious feature to give this system would be an on-screen TV interface. It does not have one. It has a small LCD screen that most people will have to squint to read from the couch. The SoundTouch app cannot be run from the TV; it requires a phone, tablet, or computer. If you want to play Internet music, you will need to have one of those devices handy. As I mentioned previously, the app allows you to set 6 presets. Why 6 and not 8, 64, or 128? It seems like the cost of adding more would be essentially $0, so it's unclear why Bose stopped there. As I also mentioned, the app allows you to play the same source on multipel SoundTouch devices, which is nice. On the other hand, the devices tend to respond slowly, and this means that it can be very frustrating to get the host/client working together properly. Once the relationship is set, though, it works seamlessly. On the other hand, if you, say, use the app to run iTunes from your computer (which you can do), it will play iTunes on the SoundTouch device or devices, but you won't get the sound on your computer. So, the interface works, but it's a bit clunky, and it seems designed to shut your computer out of the mix except as a sound source. One other thing: the remote seems to glitch now and then. We've had problems with the console switching from the cable box as a sound source to the TV with no obvious reason or input from us. We've also had problems where the TV seems to get spontaneously reconfigured so it's no longer sending sound to the console. (This could be a problem with the TV and not the Bose, of course.)OTHER: You need to consider what you're going to do with the speakers. We have the rear speakers sitting on the back of our couch, which is not as bad as it might seem, but isn't ideal either. You will have the best experience if you're prepared to purchase professional installation or some combination of stands and mounting brackets, or if you already have furniture with sufficient space to place the speakers. Remember also that the speakers aside from the subwoofer are wired, and you're going to have to hide them, put them inside the walls, or find some way of making them less ugly -- and less trip-inducing.BOTTOM LINE: Choose this system if you're willing to pay a premium for a brand you recognize, good sound, and a stylish look. If you have the bucks to buy 1-2 additional SoundTouch systems for, say, the kitchen and the bedroom, that's even better. If you're on a budget or you want a seriously customizable system (or a full set of wireless speakers), however, you're probably better off looking elsewhere.P.S. I just did the AdaptIQ calibration (included; you wear a headset and sit at 5 different listening positions) and it improved the system's audio imaging. Not a dramatic improvement, but a noticeable one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ9CYAEH454G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6N22#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ9CYAEH454G","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping to be wowed by the Ear Force Recon 50 Gaming Headset, but I wasn't. There's nothing major wrong with it; it just doesn't impress. The Recon 50 is a medium-weight all-plastic over-ear headset with an adjustable/removable boom microphone. It connects to your PC or other device using either a combined mic/headphone mini-plug jack or (via the included splitter cable) separate mic and headphone mini-plug jacks. (The cable with the combined jack is not terribly long, so I'm using the splitter cable to add length.) It is unpowered (no USB, no battery), which translates into relatively low gain from the microphone, no noise cancellation, and no amplification beyond what your computer/device supplies. The ear cups fit snugly -- with a bit too much pressure for my taste -- and do a reasonable job of filtering out external noise. The pads are soft but not especially thick, so my ears are touching the headphone drivers -- something that will probably get worse as the light foam in the pads wears down. The padding on the wide, hard top band of the headphone is minimal, potentially causing discomfort for those without thick hair. The sound is not bad at all, however, even for music (contrary to what some say). The bendy boom -- it has an internal wire that can be manipulated pretty extensively -- is a nice feature. The microphone mute switch has a teeny little label, making it tough to be sure whether it's set on or off, and the volume dial next to it is both very small and no better labeled.Overall, the Recon 50 is OK. It works OK, it looks OK (if you like red plastic), and its pricing is OK. Personally, I would consider spending just a bit more to get a more full-featured USB headset. Still, the Recon 50 is worth considering if you're shopping for a headset for under $40.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YR8TDT3TU22Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC3S818#wasThisHelpful","R2YR8TDT3TU22Q","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""The Rest of Us Just Live Here,"" Patrick Ness tells the story of how aliens from another dimension are trying to consume the earth and its inhabitants in order to feed their insatiable need for power, and how a group of misunderstood kids are doing their best to save us from complete and utter destruction. Except that, in a complete reversal of the usual order of things, all the insane and tense sci-fi/fantasy action takes place off-stage while the main characters are focused on their struggles with OCD, anorexia, unrequited love, alcoholic dads, absent moms, loneliness, jealousy, and impending graduation from high school.Our narrator is Mikey, an OCD-prone high school senior who tends to wash his hands obsessively and count things compulsively when he is under stress. And he is under a lot of stress now because he's going to be moving away to college soon, he's worried about leaving his little sister at home with his irresponsible dad and his barely-present mom, his best friend is acting weird, and the girl he has a huge crush on is between boyfriends but about to leave town. Strange lights are appearing in the skies and the ""indie kids"" seem to be dying right and left, but the indie kids will take care of it and afterwards let everybody else know what happened. Probably.The book revolves mainly around Mikey's loving relationships with his sisters Mel and Meredith, his friend Jared (whose grandmother was a god), and his tentative not-exactly-romantic relationship with Henna, and how these develop in good and bad ways as graduation (and Armageddon) approaches. The off-stage fantasy story about Immortals and princes and amulets is silly, convoluted, and generally a nice foil for the more mundane turmoil in the lives of Mikey and his circle of friends and relatives. As Mikey's inner crisis intensifies, so does the fantasy battle, but Mikey's world and the broader world barely intersect except in a few isolated instances where each perturbs the other's narrative just a little.It's a good book for people who'd like to see heroic fantasy lightly skewered; it's a good book for people who want to read about conditions like OCD and anorexia without seeing sufferers treated either like lepers or saints; and it's a good book for people who have created families of choice or who can imagine themselves doing so. Also, it's not a laugh-out-loud funny book, but Ness treats everyone and everything with a (mostly) gentle and sympathetic humor that's less crotchety than Garrison Keillor and less aggressively over-the-top than Terry Pratchett's. So, it's a good book for that, too.I suspect that kids, and especially teenage boys, will be disappointed by the relative lack of action in the book and the touchy-feely nature of so much of the story. On the other hand, I'm certain that there are many teenage boys whose problems and worries are not so much different from Mikey's, and, with a little patience, they might find some reassuring and useful reassurance in Ness' story of Mikey's progress and missteps.pokes fun at the heroes and anti-heroes of young adult fantasy and sci-fi by telling the story of regular folks trying to get on with their lives while ""special"" kids tangle with aliens, gods, the undead, or","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ALF89PN5T02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R32ALF89PN5T02","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Folkmanis Snowy Owl Hand Puppet is exactly what it looks like online: a fluffy, cute hand puppet. When you put your hand inside the lined interior (a mark of quality), you can turn the owl's head around (360 degrees) by grasping and twisting a dowel, and, if your fingers are long enough, you stick them into the wings pockets and flap them.(If you're a little kid, you're going to have trouble flapping more than one wing at a time.) The beak does not open and the feet cannot be directly manipulated.The quality of the owl -- design, materials, and the stuffed animal equivalent of ""fit and finish"" -- is very good for the price. My only complaint about quality control is that the fur around the left eye keeps wanting to cover it up, giving the owl a bit of a squinty look.Bottom line: A fine gift for a child (I would go with 5-and-up rather than 3-and-up) or an adult who likes stuffed animals and/or puppets. Though it does not claim to be a replica of Harry Potter's owl Hedwig, it's still particularly apropos for fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTU6B9W24639/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K5F9#wasThisHelpful","R2PTU6B9W24639","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router may look like a bug flipped onto its back, but it offers three independent high speed wireless channels, one at 2.4GHz (600Mbps) and two at 5GHz (1300Mbps each), promising high levels of wireless throughput to households and offices with multiple high speed-capable wireless devices such as computers, network disks, game consoles, and TVs. It also includes USB ports to allow network access to otherwise non-networked storage.My experience with the unit so far has been mostly positive. The installation instructions are well-designed and clear, as is the provided paper documentation. The unit's built-in menus are also well-designed and understandable and have intelligible and useful help information. Installation was not difficult, although I did have to use a network utility to find the unit's dynamically allocated IP address. The only real glitch I've had so far with the unit is that my printer, which I have left on an older, lower-speed wireless router, cannot ""see"" my computer when it uses the TP-LINK. The computer can ""see"" the printer, suggesting that this may represent be a flaw in the HP Officejet Pro 8620 networking code. (I'll update after further troubleshooting.)Pros:- Delivers high speed wireless networking- Can be attached to any router with a spare Ethernet port- Good instructions, documentation, menus, help system- Available USB ports (1 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 2.0) for storage or whatever- Appears to be well-made- Isn't too large or obtrusive if you can get over the six bug legs sticking in the air- Plenty of configurability- Can shut down channels if not using them, possibly conserving energyCons:- Not an ideal living room fixture- Not designed to stack easily- May have issues with legacy equipmentBottom line: This device is designed to deliver high speed wireless service to a home/office with several bandwidth-hogging networked devices. If it's just you and your laptop, this device is overkill. If your incoming network bandwidth is low or your router doesn't support high speed Ethernet, it may still be overkill. It's not like fast wireless is going to speed up your external Internet connection. If you have a need for multiple high speed wireless channels, however, this device (which I have not tested under a heavy load) seems like an excellent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6RD8LZ0U16K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6RD8LZ0U16K","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, comfort has been very elusive.Pros:- Highly adjustable for the price- Reasonably well-builtCons:- Seat cushion may be overly long for men of below-average height (and most women)- Inadequate range of adjustment for arm rests -- not wide enough and not high enough- Inadequate range of adjustment for chair backrest -- does not go high enoughThis chair adjusts in multiple dimensions (both the seat and the backrest go up/down, back/forward, and tilt up/down, and the armrests go up/down and in/out), but the range of available adjustments will not be wide enough for all. I've recently come to the conclusion that the chair is best suited to men of slightly above-average size (width and height). If you're above average in weight or shorter than the average man (I'm over 200lbs and 5'8""), this might not be your ideal chair.

"We use vacuum sealer bags and rolls a lot, but we don't always use FoodSaver brand bags or rolls. (FWIW, our machine is not a FoodSaver, either. We had one and loved it, but it was lost in a fire and we ended up trying a competitor's machine: the Nesco VS-02 Food Vacuum Sealer, Black/Silver, which isn't as shiny, but still does the job.)We decided to try the FoodSaver DAM Bags because sometimes moisture from food, especially raw meats, gets vacuumed out along with the air, making a mess in the machine and in the top of the bag. If you'll pardon my language, these DAM bags seem to do their DAM job. They have an absorbent strip (about 2-1/2 inches wide) above the food but below the seal line. Any juice or moisture gets trapped there by the strip, so the area above the seal stays clean! We usually use smaller bags, so we probably should have gotten the quart-sized bags instead of the gallon-sized, but that's our problem and no reflection on the bags. These bags are about twice as expensive as garden variety FoodSaver gallon bags, so we won't be using them every day, but for juicy meats, we'll definitely turn to these DAM bags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRSF0IGN8U0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AL2AUR0#wasThisHelpful","R1QRSF0IGN8U0V","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tech Tools Desktop Madness Series Hand Pencil holder is very cute, but I am disappointed with the product. The biggest problem is the shallow pencil-holding cup -- it's only 2 inches deep! Normal-sized pens and pencils, which are about 6 inches long, are likely to tumble out of the cup if lightly bumped. There is no way that you would put normal-sized scissors in the cup (as in the photo of the product). The capacity of the pencil holder is much too small given the product's large, er, desktop handprint. I would also have preferred a ceramic hand, but the product IS clearly labeled as plastic/cement mix (whatever that means).

"""Dark Eden"" was not an easy book to read, and ""Mother of Eden"" is even tougher. The problem is not author Chris Beckett's writing skills, which are good; his rapid switching between first-person narrators, which is a mechanism I don't like, but which is easy to follow and does not disrupt the narrative; or his simulation of several centuries of linguistic drift, which is more atmospheric than annoying. Instead, the main problems are unsympathetic characters and a difficult-to-escape sense that Beckett is less interested in telling a compelling story than he is in advancing a particular view of human history. I see where Becket is coming from (I think), and I mostly share his views, but I still find his approach stultifying.What am I talking about? Beckett's story is driven by at least three strands of narrative. The first is pretty obvious: the story of Adam, Eve, Eden, and man's fall. The second is environmental, and was more obvious in ""Dark Eden"" than in the second book: when you live in a world of finite resources and you have a growing population, something's got to give, and pretending that everything will be fine because everything has always been fine is going to end in disaster. The third and much more complex thread is the whole complex set of intertwined social processes that bind politics, economics, social status, reproduction, gender, and violence together. (If you've read Engels' 1884 ""The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State,"" then this is familiar territory.) ""Dark Eden"" is much less about the Fall of Man than it is about the Fall of Woman and the Rise of Man. At the outset of Beckett's Eden, women enjoyed slightly higher social status than men in a largely egalitarian society where the biggest differences in status were those of age, symbolized by the rule of a council of elders. As the population of the original valley began to exceed the valley's carrying capacity, adventurous John set out to find new lands, but not before incurring the wrath of conservative David. The actions of John and his followers, as we see in ""Mother of Eden,"" kickstarted a web of social, economic, and political developments, that included the development of trade, the invention of money, the growth of a stratum of male soldiers, mercenaries, and ne'er-do-wells, the rediscovery of torture and execution, the accelerating subordination of women accompanying the growth of large gaps in social status and wealth, the emergence of warlords and princes, and, most recently, the development of metal weapons and tools and the prospects of large scale warfare.It's no accident that Beckett places Starlight Brooking and her friends, who live in a peaceful egalitarian backwater, at the center of this tale. They are outside observers almost as much as we are. Ambitious and self-absorbed Starlight becomes our unwitting tour guide as she gives in to the seductive allure of the the city and, almost immediately on arrival, falls in love with an exotic princeling from a faraway land. This allows her to experience both the glories of economic development and the horrors of militarism and extreme social stratification. She is drawn in and repelled at the same time. Beckett repeatedly suggests that economic development sucks, but also that it sucks us in; the rewards of social and economic development outweigh (in some sort of calculus) the costs.I don't have problems with any of that, or very little of it. What I do have a problem with is how difficult it is to care about the characters or get into the story. Fortunately, this problem wanes (but does not disappear) before the end of the book's first half.High points include the subplot about the sentience of Eden's ""bats"" (I am still intrigued by what Beckett hints is the artificial genesis of the rogue planet. And why do all the animals have hands? That's weird.); the tortured, narrow, silly, and transparently sexist logic by which a philosopher concludes that the president of Earth was a man (even though it had always been known that she was a woman) and Starlight's to-the-point rebuttal; and the viscerally angering accounts of self-importance of the ""big people"" and the obvious suffering of the ""little people"".Bottom line: Beckett is not a clumsy or unskilled storyteller, but the ""Dark Eden"" books are difficult to enjoy. I like them a lot more for the sophistication of the message they send than for the quality of the story they tell. I might have used them in my sociology courses if I they had been around while I was teaching and if I had thought that students would read them. But for the general sci-fi reader ... I really don't know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWQIU1536NHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138702#wasThisHelpful","R3PWQIU1536NHO","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The striking JBL Horizon Bluetooth Clock Radio is a quirky product with a number of design flaws, but I can't help liking it. Let's start with the flaws. The controls for the unit are all on the top, which is fine, but all but  two of them are flush with the surface of the unit and cannot be located by touch and there is (as far as I know) no way to light up only those buttons. (Only the ""set"" button and the snooze/light bar stand out.) If it's dark and you want to change the alarm without turning the light up and waking your partner, you have to keep pushing down in random spots until you feel a click. Because the unit is tall and has a relatively small base, it's easy to knock over, and the power cable, which just slides into a hole in the bottom of the unit and does not have any sort of bracing, so it comes out too easily. (Fortunately, the unit has battery backup and ships with a battery. Note that you will need to open up the battery compartment, remove, and replace the battery to activate it on a new unit.) The unit comes with three preset alarms, all of which are musical. This may minimize the degree to which the alarm annoys the neighbors, even when it's at maximum volume, but it's not for traditionalists who prefer the customary beep-Beep-BEEP-BEEP!!! alarm sound. At least it doesn't startle you too much, as long as you don't choose a radio alarm and set it to a heavy metal station. (Note that some early units appear to have had a bug that quickly accelerated the alarm from 0 to amazingly loud. My unit did not have that problem.) Finally, there is no documentation available, not even online, beyond the mostly language-free quick start guide. What does the ""sleep"" setting do? I thought it would let me set a short-term (up to 60 minutes) nap, and it seems like it should do that, but when the timer reaches the end of the period you set, it just flashes a light for a few seconds. How useful is that? There must be a way to get an audible alarm, but -- and this was my point -- there's no documentation.On the plus side, the USB charging ports are a nice feature, as is the ability to set multiple radio presets -- something rare on a clock radio. The sound is good for a reasonably-priced clock radio, but it's a bit bass-heavy, a little muddy, and the maximum volume is not too impressive. While the design looks like something out of ""2001"" and probably clashes with your furniture and furnishings, it looks kinda cute. The auto-dimming white light of the clock is not at all bothersome while still being legible at low levels. Radio reception is decent, though not amazing. The Bluetooth feature worked fine with my Kindle, but I can't claim to have tested it widely.Bottom line: This product's biggest flaw is probably the fact that too few of the controls can be located by touch. The absence of a decent manual is also a major problem. On the other hand, if you like the unit's looks, and if you're actually going to listen to the radio or the unit as a Bluetooth speaker, you may be able to overlook a few shortcomings. It's not for everybody, but it might be for you.P.S. Having used this product and grown increasingly frustrated with its flaws and limitations, I have reduced its rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. The near-impossibility of finding by feel the buttons to turn the alarm on or off is my biggest frustration, followed by the unnecessary difficulty of changing the alarm time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLDTZP7FZJWTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD3U2D0#wasThisHelpful","RLDTZP7FZJWTI","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In “Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World,” Donald Sull and Kathleen M. Eisenhardt argue forcefully that governments, organizations, and individuals seeking to master the growing complexity of the contemporary world will find their salvation not in equally complicated policies and guidelines, but in simple rules. In a diverse array of examples, most drawn from business and government, they show that “Keep it simple, stupid!” is not a simple-minded principle, but rather one that requires a good deal of experience, insight, focus, and thought to accomplish. In the end, they cannot show that simplicity always or even usually trumps complexity – they cannot refute Einstein’s “A scientific theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler” – but they do a good job of reminding us that there is both elegance and value in emphasizing fundamentals and paring away the cruft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24K9XRLKBXEZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409906#wasThisHelpful","R24K9XRLKBXEZE","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've been using the shampoo for several days, and my impressions are mixed. On the plus side, I like the scent of the shampoo, and I especially like the tingly feeling in my scalp after I've washed my hair with the product. (It feels like menthol, but menthol is not listed as an ingredient.)  I can't say for certain that my thinning hair is any thicker than usual, but it feels nicely conditioned in the morning after I shower. On the minus side, I am experiencing more scalp itching since I've been using the product, and my normally dry hair has become a bit oily.

My experience does not mean that others should avoid this shampoo, but those who have not had good experiences with 2-in-1s in the past should consider starting with a smaller, less expensive bottle.P.S.

"""The Dark Side of the Road"" is the first volume in a new Simon R. Green series featuring Ishmael Jones, an apparently-immortal alien who arrived on Earth in the 1960s and hasn't aged a day since. Vulnerable to Men-In-Black-type agencies that think the best alien is a dead alien, Jones has enjoyed the protection of a super-secret group called ""The Organization"" for the past 15 years. In return, Jones has been an alien hunter himself, keeping the good ones in line and terminating the bad ones with extreme prejudice.In the wake of an enormous Christmas storm, Jones' boss -- ""the Colonel"" -- makes a personal plea to Jones for help. Something has gone terribly awry at the his family's English country estate, and the Colonel clearly believes that Jones' specialized skills are needed. But when Jones arrives, the Colonel is nowhere to be found. This leaves Jones to mingle with the bitterly bickering cast of characters, including the doddering old patriarch, his bitter first wife, the ex's opportunistic companion, the patriarch's scheming second wife, the wife's uninhibited daughter, the daughter's unwilling-to-let-go ex-fiancee, the patriarch's money-hungry business partner, and the patriarch's butler-cum-bodyguard. When guests begin dying off one by one, Jones must use all of his limited detecting skills -- and his superhuman hearing, sense of smell, and strength -- to find the killer and protect the survivors.If you've read Green before, you know the drill. The first-person narrator is sardonic but vulnerable; hard on the outside but soft and a bit heartbroken on the inside. Ishmael Jones isn't John Taylor (from Green's ""Nightside"" series) but the two men bear a strong family resemblance. The plot lurches along, the dialogue is terribly artificial, and the denouement is tidy but not in the least bit elegant. Agatha Christie's detectives may solve their mysteries through brilliant deductions, but Green's characters are more likely to find the murderer by waiting until most of the suspects are dead. You read Green for sharp wit, not sharp wits; for a brief diversion, not a lengthy meditation.Bottom line: Recommended to Green fans who want more of the same. I haven't read anywhere near half of Green's novels; still, I'd wager this one is above average but not in the top third. Also recommended to those who are not familiar with Green but think they might enjoy a locked-room murder mystery featuring a heartsick immortal alien with special powers. On the other hand, if you love traditional mysteries, you will probably hate this book; Green has about as much respect for mystery genre conventions as he has for naive tourists who wander into the bad part of town looking for a good time.N.B.

"How can you criticize a guy who has built his business career on improving the world by bringing people closer together (in his earlier efforts to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians) and improve the quality and nutrition of the food people eat (KIND bars)? You don't.His book, on the other hand ...""Do the KIND Thing"" is a self-help book focusing on how to live the purpose-driven life you choose for yourself. Sort of. It's also fighting to be the autobiography of a brilliant young(-er than me) social entrepreneur . And the biography of a successful retail brand. And a primer on social entrepreneurship. It is all of these things, but enough of the book works at cross purposes to itself that it mostly winds up being a bunch of anecdotes organized around themes like ""grit"" and ""originality."" If you're new to self-help books, you might find this sort of thing cool and inspirational; to me, and I will admit to being jaded, it's more of the same.Another of the book's problems is that, despite Lubetsky's social orientation, he is very focused on Lubetsky. This makes sense if your view is that we change the world by encouraging individuals to act. Act how? He really doesn't say. There's no overarching vision of the Good, and no sense that the Good will come from anything beyond individual people deciding to make things better. So, while Lubetsky has a story about how he did good, and about how maybe you can do good, he doesn't have a convincing story about what's wrong with the world, what a better world looks like, and why social entrepreneurship ... or being KIND ... is what will get us there.Bottom line: Not actively bad, but too focused on Lubetsky and his narrow conception of how to fix the world.

"I just finished reading the re-released version of Joe Haldeman's 1981 novel ""Worlds."" It's fantastic.Or very good, anyway. A brilliant young woman born in the orbital colony of New New York is awarded a trip to Old New York for an academic fellowship. A restless non-conformist, O'Hara sleeps around a bit, runs afoul of some violent men, and drifts into the orbit of some people who talk about themselves as libertarian revolutionaries. When New New discovers some precious resources on the moon, the relationship between the USA and the Worlds -- that is, all of the orbital colonies, big and small, weird and arguably wonderful -- destabilizes. A cycle of tit-for-tat economic warfare ensues, and, mostly because the wrong person is in the right place at the right time, things get wildly out of hand.The novel is filled with politics, sex, romance, conflict, odd characters, and oddball groups. Sci-fi novels about conflicts between Earth and its early offworld colonies are nothing new, and weren't all that new in 1981, either. Ditto for sci-fi novels about the early stages of interstellar exploration. What makes ""Worlds"" shine is the the emergence of O'Hara as an independent young woman whose experiences in orbit shape her experiences on Earth which in turn inform who she becomes when she returns home to orbit. She's a vivid and compelling character, if not necessarily an authentic one.On the downside, the book is bound to leave the reader with some questions that will never be answered, like: what the heck was this US revolution that came before O'Hara arrived? What the heck did the new revolutionaries think they were doing? How the ... heck did they let General Nutcase do his thing? What was Haldeman trying to say about politics except that it can get dirty and nasty?In any event, I wouldn't say that ""Worlds"" and its two follow-up novels are absolutely essential reading, but those who enjoy Haldeman's thoughtful writing should definitely consider picking them up. Also, if you're one of the people who's jumped on the new polyamory bandwagon, you might well enjoy O'Hara's living arrangements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IA69WNB1KLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI184NQ#wasThisHelpful","R30IA69WNB1KLM","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When young Medo innocently (more or less) stumbles into black magic and gets herself exiled for it, she finds herself hunted by an evil dragon. Turned out by the people she loves, accompanied only by a pet squirrel (who used to be a human knight named Hewbert), she soon picks up traveling companion Owyn, a boy of roughly her own age. Owyn is suffering a different sort of exile; he saved the life of a rebel leader and is on the lam from authorities that want to execute him for treason. The trio (Medo, Hewbert, and Owyn) must face the dragon and its human servants more than once as they struggle to survive in a cruel and unsympathetic world, helped (somewhat) by Marlin, a not-especially-effectual wizard with his own problems.""The Dragon Beshrewed"" is a well-told tale of adventure, heroism, loyalty, and self-realization. The book is suitable for early teens and up, but may be a bit intense and scary for kids at the lower end of the age range. (And it's not a ""kissing book."") As an adult reader, I can testify that it's a great read for not-so-young readers, too. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KCHE6HZRRD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JL4A1AK#wasThisHelpful","R9KCHE6HZRRD3","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing you must understand about this pitcher is that it is not a French Press and it is not a Takeya-type pitcher with a removable brewing basket. It's a thin glass heat-tolerant, dishwasher-safe pitcher with a non-movable French Press stainless steel mesh filter just under the spout.Potential uses for the pitcher include brewing hot tea that you will be consuming right away, cold-brewing tea or coffee in the fridge overnight, and serving water infused with lemon or cucumber. It can also be used for any other purpose you'd normally want a moderate-sized pitcher for, like serving orange juice. But it's definitely not for brewing hot coffee or tea if you're not going to be consuming the beverage quickly or moving it to another container, because there's no way to remove the grounds/leaves without removing the beverage first.Pros: Looks nice, less fragile than it seems.Cons: Not a substitute for a hot brew pitcher like a Takeya, a French Press, or a nice teapot with a removable filter. On the fragile side. (The first one I received arrived broken.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHIFPMJL0VRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QX99ZX0#wasThisHelpful","R2PHIFPMJL0VRY","A3O0GVCFV59SZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0GVCFV59SZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve used Bio Bags for years – 3 gallon bags for my small compost bin as well in the bathroom bin for paper waste. Then I came across the similar World Centric compostable bags and decided to try them out. So here is a comparison of the two.Quality: For me, the World Centric bags are a clear winner. This is based mostly on how well they perform as… well, bags! If they fall apart then I may as well just put my food scraps directly in the bin and skip using bags altogether (Hmmm… perhaps I will!). The World Centric bags hold themselves together pretty well – even in mid-summer with lots of wet food waste. The BioBags will fall apart within a week under the same conditions, accompanied by the smell of rotting food along the way. However, I found out the reason for this: BioBags have a high “Water Vapor Transmission Rate” – in other words moisture leaks out of your bag o’ scraps pretty efficiently. This may explain why the bags don’t perform so well for me: in my Simple Human pedal bin there’s nowhere for this moisture to go other than the lid. If I used a properly ventilated composting bin apparently this would not happen as much. But the World Centric bags don’t have these issues in a pedal bin – as well as not falling apart they also don’t generate as much odor, fungal growth, or dripping moisture as the BioBags.Note that both types bags have a limited shelf life – you should use them within a year (or shorter in humid places) and they should also be stored in a cool dry place.Price: BioBags are the winner if you go by pricing on Amazon. They are about half the price of the World Centric bags. However, in stores I’ve bought World Centric bags for around four bucks for 25 bags (about the same as BioBags).So, as far as gold stars are concerned (quality and price) I think BioBags deserve 4/5 gold stars (I’m being generous, assuming that they hold together better in a compost bin than a peddle bin) and World Centric deserves 5/5 gold stars (if you can get them for around 5 bucks, but even at 8 they may be worth it for some people).Based on social and environmental factors (read on for more details) I think BioBags deserve 4/5 green stars while World Centric deserve 5/5 green stars. So WC bags win both in terms of quality (gold stars) and sustainability (green stars).Both types of bags are certified for composting both at home and industrially. I don’t think there’s any doubt that these bags will compost fairly quickly. Also, in both cases (and all compostable bags that I know of) they are made from a mixture of resin that is made from oil and a renewable polymer, typically PLA (poly-lactic acid) made from corn or potato starch. If you need more info, BioBags uses Mater-Bi from Italy, while World Centric use Ingeo (PLA) made by NatureWorks. On the company website, World Centric shows an in-depth comparison of their materials versus conventional alternatives, looking at energy and water inputs and waste or CO2 outputs.World Centric are most known for utensils and plates; compostable bags appear to be a more recent addition to their product range. They offset all of their carbon to have a zero carbon footprint. They donate 25% of their profits to grassroots social and environmental organizations. They offer compostable lunch trays at cost to schools to replace Styrofoam trays. They aim to be a zero-waste office and member and sponsor of the zero waste business council. They audit their outsourced factories under Fair Labor Organization guidelines to ensure fair wages and working conditions for workers. Their packaging is FSC-certified and the bags are printed with soy-based inks.BioBag devote most of their website to the benefits and practicalities of composting. This is useful, but they don’t have a lot to say about themselves as a company. The cardboard packaging doesn’t say anything about being recycled or FSC-certified (or what kind of printing inks they use). I think BioBag deserve a lot of credit for launching a successful line of compostable bags - they created a positive change by making it easier for a lot of people to starting composting their food waste.

The BioBags will fall apart within a week under the same conditions, accompanied by the smell of rotting food along the way. However, I found out the reason for this: BioBags have a high “Water Vapor Transmission Rate” – in other words moisture leaks out of your bag o’ scraps pretty efficiently. This may explain why the bags don’t perform so well for me: in my Simple Human pedal bin there’s nowhere for this moisture to go other than the lid. If I used a properly ventilated composting bin apparently this would not happen as much. But the World Centric bags don’t have these issues in a pedal bin – as well as not falling apart they also don’t generate as much odor, fungal growth, or dripping moisture as the BioBags.Note that both types bags have a limited shelf life – you should use them within a year (or shorter in humid places) and they should also be stored in a cool dry place.Price: BioBags are the winner if you go by pricing on Amazon. They are about half the price of the World Centric bags. However, in stores I’ve bought World Centric bags for around four bucks for 25 bags (about the same as BioBags).So, as far as gold stars are concerned (quality and price) I think BioBags deserve 4/5 gold stars (I’m being generous, assuming that they hold together better in a compost bin than a peddle bin) and World Centric deserves 5/5 gold stars (if you can get them for around 5 bucks, but even at 8 they may be worth it for some people).Based on social and environmental factors (read on for more details) I think BioBags deserve 4/5 green stars while World Centric deserve 5/5 green stars. So WC bags win both in terms of quality (gold stars) and sustainability (green stars).Both types of bags are certified for composting both at home and industrially. I don’t think there’s any doubt that these bags will compost fairly quickly. Also, in both cases (and all compostable bags that I know of) they are made from a mixture of resin that is made from oil and a renewable polymer, typically PLA (poly-lactic acid) made from corn or potato starch. If you need more info, BioBags uses Mater-Bi from Italy, while World Centric use Ingeo (PLA) made by NatureWorks. On the company website, World Centric shows an in-depth comparison of their materials versus conventional alternatives, looking at energy and water inputs and waste or CO2 outputs.World Centric are most known for utensils and plates; compostable bags appear to be a more recent addition to their product range. They offset all of their carbon to have a zero carbon footprint. They donate 25% of their profits to grassroots social and environmental organizations. They offer compostable lunch trays at cost to schools to replace Styrofoam trays. They aim to be a zero-waste office and member and sponsor of the zero waste business council.

I think BioBag deserve a lot of credit for launching a successful line of compostable bags - they created a positive change by making it easier for a lot of people to starting composting their food waste.

"I’ve used Bio Bags for years – 3 gallon bags for my small compost bin as well in the bathroom bin for paper waste.

"It’s hard to keep up with PACT - they change the styles and materials frequently. Almost every pair of Pact socks that I’ve tried has been slightly different in terms of composition and fabric weight. I’ve been happy with them all and find it useful to have a range of styles (crew, dress, work socks and outdoor socks) for different shoes and temperatures. These crew socks are fairly thin (in a good way - they are well made) and fit snugly on my size 9.5 feet (they may be a little tight on size 10.5 upwards). They are ridiculously cheap now and I suspect will be gone soon.As another reviewer pointed out, these particular socks are only 51% organic cotton (not 75% as advertised) with the remainder being mainly regular cotton and nylon. So, I’m going to still give them 5 gold stars because they are very comfy and look good but perhaps 4/5 green stars because the organic content is not as high as other PACT socks, and not as advertised. More on the green star rating below…I think Pact socks offer many benefits to society and the planet: they are a certified B-Corporation, obtain cotton from farmer-run cooperatives, knit their socks in energy-efficient factories powered by renewable energy, use water-based dyes, and recycle the water used to wash their fabric. They also pay their factory workers a fair wage, and have started getting Fair Trade certification for some items. Their packaging is also sustainable – although Amazon will often ship them in a plastic bag (but you can reuse this).I would say that the only issue from sustainability standpoint is whether you want to buy cotton socks or go with an alternative fiber. If you are going to go with cotton then there’s really a world of difference between organic and conventional, since the non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide-intensive crops out there (accounting for 25% of the world’s insecticide use, and nasty ones too), with run-off into rivers and water supplies. Whether organically farmed or not, cotton farming is water-intensive and also requires a lot of land. Bamboo and hemp may be good alternatives, depending on the maker.So, overall I’ll give PACT outdoor socks 5 gold stars for quality and 4 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing them. They would deserve 5 green stars if they contained more organic cotton and also if they didn’t ship them from Amazon in plastic bags. I’d also like to see some figures from Pact to support their assurance of good factory conditions. But overall they look like one of the most socially and environmentally responsible textile companies around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HDZD9EWHGWLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUMUGTK#wasThisHelpful","R3HDZD9EWHGWLS","A1UT1Q85F0105C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UT1Q85F0105C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The serpent, the king, the tiger, the stinging wasp, the small child, the dog owned by other people, and the fool: these seven ought not to be awakened from sleep.” - ChanakyaOh, Celia keeps on keeping on . . . and what she keeps on with is writing funny, insightful, and suspenseful and, yes, totally hot books that cheer me up and engross me. Mostly quick reads, always with an undercurrent of the human condition, Celia is, in a word, AWESOME!So, here is the thing. She has a new series, Tiger Tails, that reaches, and in some ways exceeds, her other super-fun series. Ahhh… better than a cup of cocoa on a cold day. Well, even better when you can read her tales while drinking a cup of cocoa, just sayin’.Now, it’s a tale of a tail – or rather, a bunch of tails. Being literally shoved out of the closet is never pleasant. And for the tigers, well, they never wanted to come out of the “Shifter Closet” at all, no matter what the lions and wolves and bears chose to do. But, things being as they always are, secrets don’t last. And this whopper is going to cause a world of hurt for the tigers. Because, well, grabbing a tiger by the tail has a whole other meaning in Celia’s newest world.This new series by Celia is a blast. So far centering around the “coming-out-of-the-closet” of the tigers in her much-like-ours world, the first story, Fast and the Furriest introduces us to the tiger pride, and its leader, Ares. Poor Ares. Even though the lions and wolves and bears (Oh, My!) are “Out” to the public, the tigers just want to be left alone. And they stay hidden – that is, until they are rudely shoved out of the closet by an article, complete with photos, in a nasty little bit of yellow journalism. An article printed under the byline of the woman Ares thought was his. Oops. Of course, it doesn’t help that the article points out that, if you can pull a tiger’s tail, he (or she) belongs to you forever. Ah, Hell, thou hast no idiocy such as that of a human shifter stalker. “Uh, hey, lady? Really not cool to terrorize the poor pregnant tiger lady up a tree trying to pull her tail. Uh, yeah, I said PREGNANT tiger LADY.” Oy. Needless to say, it was a zoo. And it doesn’t help that DoPE (Department of Paraphysical Entities) is trying to capture high ranking female shifters in order to force them to mate with humans, so that said humans puppet masters can take over the shifter groups and control them (read: Turn them into war machines). Again, Oy.As with all of Celia’s work, there is both a large dose of humor and an even larger dose of pathos to be had in her stories. Humans in this world pretty much suck – not surprising – and there are deeper stories here of the ‘human’ condition. But be prepared to burst out laughing in public as well, if you are brave enough to read on the train ;-)I received Fast and the Furriest from Celia in exchange for a realistic review. I posted this review in a couple of spots, but I apparently pulled a Senior Moment and wandered away while posting, hence a late post to my site and multiple others. Oops! I still Love Ya, Celia!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7JDCW8KE0NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016S9XS78#wasThisHelpful","R1L7JDCW8KE0NK","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is the thing, Celia. You are pretty much the Queen of Awesome-sauceness. So say I, and so say we all! And who couldn’t agree? Everything that flows from your pen (computer? Tablet?

And it doesn’t help that DoPE (Department of Paraphysical Entities) is trying to capture high ranking female shifters in order to force them to mate with humans, so that said humans puppet masters can take over the shifter groups and control them (read: Turn them into war machines). Again, Oy.In this second book, the women are still under attack, and the stakes continue to get higher. A few women have been taken or attacked and had their tails pulled – Ares sister among them. And the daughter of the national wolf alpha, Veronica, “Ronnie” to her friends, has been attacked twice. Desperate to protect her, her father sends her back to the tigers, where her best friend and Ares mate, Zoe, lives. Only, they aren’t on the ground for ten minutes before Ronnie is attacked by humans – twice. Though she has a knife at her throat, the human press don’t catch that part, only the part where Ares’ Second, Branden, and two of his security team kill two of the attackers and critically injure one. Don’t mess with an Alpha Second when his ‘gonna be mate, no matter if she is a wolf or not’ has a knife at her throat. Ah, well. So much for the whole “We really are just harmless little kitty cats” motif.And of course, DoPE (perfect acronym, BTW) jumps on the opportunity to lock up Branden, his security team – and Ronnie as well. And you can just bet what will happen to poor Ronnie if a certain manipulative General gets his hands on her. Daughter of the National Wolf Alpha, chosen of the National Tiger Second? Score for General Disgusting Monster, all the way around. Hum… you know, as usual, the humans come off as the true monsters. Well, yeah, I can see it. If shifters showed up amongst us tomorrow, you can pretty much call it from the UF books – some salivate to get themselves a piece of ‘critter ass’ while others variously hate, intend to kill, and intend to force them into military service – or onto autopsy tables – in the name of ‘National Security’. Sigh. Hey, as if the guy next door who mowed your yard for you when you were sick and his wife who brought you chicken soup are suddenly monsters just because you suddenly found out that they like to run on four legs when the urge strikes. Ugh. Humans. The gift that keeps on needing a good gene pool cleaning . . .So, again, Celia is Awesomesauce to the Max! And you really should rush right to your reading device, or local book store, and grab up everything she has written. But starting with the Tiger Tails series is a great start if you haven’t done so already. Enjoy! I absolutely did.I sometimes get books from Celia in exchange for realistic reviews, but in this case, I just bought it. Couldn’t help myself – So excited to get the next in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFN7SBRZEE8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WK3XZU#wasThisHelpful","R2OFN7SBRZEE8P","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"<b>ZERO STARS. NOT RECOMMENDED!</B>Horrible. DNF.I expected a book about a strong, confident female fire investigator. Instead? I got a diatribe about how if you aren't ""god fearing"" you aren't worth dirt. Smarmy, acrimonious, sanctimonious - you get the picture. I never can fathom the mindset of the rabidly religious. Supposedly, Jesus said something to the effect of being kind, considerate, understanding, and to love your neighbor. This book falls on the side of ""If you don't fall in lockstep like Hitler's little soldier, you aren't as good as me and better fall in line and understand that everything is 'gods will', no matter what atrocities happen to and around you (and believe me, if this 'god's will has caused a tenth of the things I have seen in my life, that is one vicious bastard - just sayin') - and if you don't, you aren't worth love, compassion, consideration, kindness or understanding.""Observe.The police chief is supposedly 'taken' with her, but since she isn't fall-on-her-knees and 'thank the lord' every time something horrible happens (for example, the fire that killed her parents - which she accidentally started at 7 years old being a prime example) she isn't good enough for his holier-than-thou self. Believe me, he doesn't deserve a strong, capable, intelligent woman (one he looks down on not only because she doesn't buy into the religious fervor, but because she isn't ""ladylike"" and works on car engines instead of doing needlepoint. ) And she <u>buys into it</u> - because she is working under a car and has oil on her face, she is humiliated (?!?!) when he shows up unexpectedly and sees her being a real, live person instead of a plastic Barbie doll. Gag.And: He was ""appalled""(!) that she "". . . doesn't have a 'personal relationship' with 'him.' Oh, and I really loved the "". . . he knew right away she was a McGregor, or according to her wedding ring, used to be."" (So, because she got married she belongs to her husband now, and can't lay claim to her original family? What, her DNA changed or something?)But the best zinger? I <I>really</i> loved this,  "" . . . he likes her, but """"He needed someone that shared his faith, a woman whose heart belonged to God. . ."""" The next words he thinks? ""Lord, soften her heart so she can know the <I><b><u>unconditional love</u></b></i> you offer to all your children.""WOW! Hypocrite Much?!?!?Ugh. That is when I flipped over to the end for a laugh and read ""God totaled your car . . .to prove a point."" Well, actually, Mr. Hypocritical was apparently driving her hand restored-antique VW Beetle at the time, but far be it from HIM to accept responsibility for his own actions. god musta done it. Yeah, that's it! god dun' it! I was going to check to see if ""god"" wrecked her car to prove that pretty little girls didn't do things like be fire investigators and restore cars, they cooked, cleaned, bred good little Stepford children, and went to church instead, but by that time I pretty much threw up in my mouth, deleted this crap from my reader, and poured a glass of 15 year old Scotch to wash the garbage out of my mouth. Now, if I could just find some bleach for my brain, maybe I can wash out my mind as well.I am sure she winds up toeing the line, falling for the religious pablum and falling on her back to breed all sorts of new little god fearing brats, but I could have cared less what happened in the end.  I just can't believe that a woman still finds it acceptable to write a book where women (and others) are treated like garbage because they don't allow themselves to drink the Koolaid and become Stepford robots. That is the same attitude that makes it acceptable in men's minds to treat women as less than human, less than men, only good for screwing, breeding, cooking and cleaning, and being a punching bag. Who should have no rights to lives of their own, to hold down high paying jobs, exhibit self-confidence or control over their own bodies, the right to choose what to do with their own lives, or the right to walk down a street in safety without being pulled into an alley and raped, or to be able to actually be in a relationship of their choosing without being beaten and demeaned on a regular basis just because a wife is 'property.' The author's mindset hearkens back to the bad old days, when all these things were commonplace and accepted as simply the way things were. In other words, this author should be ashamed of herself. If this is the way the 'church' still thinks, no wonder they are losing followers by the thousands. This mindset is medieval.Honestly, I would have simply deleted it without blowing up in print, though I would have still hit the Scotch bottle and wished for brain bleach -  but to be honest, the fact is that I find it deeply offensive this atrocity received five stars from others. Until we outgrow the mindset of women as lesser beings we will never advance as human beings. And until we outgrow religious fanaticism humans will continue to devolve back into savages, fighting wars and spreading hate based on superstition.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7F8F0RP861MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010U2C9B0#wasThisHelpful","R7F8F0RP861MC","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate Baray continues her Episodic, and it keeps getting better! An offshoot of her Lost Library series, Spirelli Paranormal Investigations, Episode 3, continues the story of Jack Spirelli, Paranormal investigator and Marin, his dragon sidekick. The story in Episode 1 was the first Jack and Marin worked together – and a ghost is determined to ascertain that it is their last. It was lovely fun. In Episode 2, Jack and Marin’s next case take them back to Louisiana, where a single case of “something odd is going on . . .” becomes much more, and much more dangerous, than they ever expected.Now, in Episode 3, Jack and Marin bite off an even bigger chunk of “paranormal pain-in-the-ass” as they take on protecting Sylvia, a coven witch determined to escape the coven’s control. But Jack has a truly bad history with the coven – and that history may get the three of them dead just as much as the coven’s determination to make sure Sylvia doesn’t escape their grasp.I’m not a lover of episode storylines, but Kate does it right. These are complete novelettes, with beginning, middle, and end – something that most don’t offer, and Kate blows out of the water. If you haven’t read the Lost Library series, I highly recommend it.Thanks Kate, for once again offering me the opportunity to read and review your stories!

"I had really fun Halloween. Well, a fun reading Halloween. Out here we don’t get trick-or-treaters, but I did get to read The Vampire Mail Order Bride by Kristen Painter. Truthfully, I am not a vampire lover. As anyone reading my reviews knows, after working in the morgue, the whole ‘kissing the dead’ thing just really doesn’t do it for me. But in this case, the mythology Kristen developed made it a whole lot more fun for me.Delaney James is in a bad spot. After seeing her boss at the restaurant shoot someone, and getting caught at catching him, she is on the run. Slipping into a business to slip her pursuers, she finds it to be a dating service. Snatching a file off the desk, she finds herself posing as a match for a groom-to-be. Hummm . . . gunned down by a mobster, or faking being a bride wannabe? Easy peasy.Only, it really isn’t. Because not only does her possible groom not actually not want to be a groom (those pesky moms and their manipulations in order to get grandkids can be a real pain – even if they are really, really old) he is a 400-year-old vampire. Uh. She certainly didn’t expect THAT!The town of Nocturne Falls, where Halloween is a 365 day event, is a character in the book all on its own. A great one at that. This is book one, and I can hardly wait to dig into the next. Great fun with a light and fluffy attitude!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXCMFCX2F652T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDME5O8#wasThisHelpful","RXCMFCX2F652T","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The thing about whining about how Nice Guys come last? Sound to me like choosing the wrong women causes pain for the so-called ""Nice Guy"". Nice Guys should look for Nice Girls instead of getting all hot and bothered by Naughty Girls. I know an awful lot of Nice Girls that would love to find _Real_ Nice Guys... but they all seem to fall for the Hot Plastic Women with the fake boobs, fake butts and gimme-gimme problems... Real Nice Girls are kind. Self sufficient. Give of themselves without being a doormat. They understand give-and-take, they aren't the ""fun party girls"" but they should be fun - as in sharing the feelings of fun that you enjoy as well. You won't feel desperate for attention around them. Instead, they make you feel complete, happy, at peace. Yes, you may fight sometimes. But they aren't nasty, name calling, pottery throwing fights. And the make-up sex is still awesome. And, here is a hint - the Nice Girls can still be hot - just without feeling like they need the plastic boobs and butts and drug and alcohol addictions. Of course, that doesn't mean Nice Girls can't get down and dirty. . . believe me . . . I have a few friends who are as Nice as Nice can be - who can still strap on the hot clothes and party down - just without getting nasty drunk and making an ass of themselves.  Maybe a change to the attitude will make life smoother?","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8D5949MAN8U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI1O8U4#wasThisHelpful","R8D5949MAN8U1","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Farie contains many things besides elves and fays, and besides dwarfs, witches, trolls, giants, or dragons; it holds the seas, the sun, the moon, the sky; and the earth, and all things that are in it: tree and bird, water and stone, wine and bread, and ourselves, mortal men, when we are enchanted.”― J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien on Fairy-storiesArcheologist Taryn St. Giles just can’t catch a break. Her last few patrons died or disappeared on her, Crusty Bucket is drunk again, and some jerk started a fight in the Shimmering Dewdrop. On a Tuesday night, no less! And to top it off? The same jerk who started the fight is the character she has been trying to find all day. Well, if she can’t work as an archeologist, she has to do something. And at least being a bounty hunter puts food on the table and keeps a roof over their heads. Yes, I said “their.” As in, Taryn, the aforementioned Crusty Bucket, Garbage Blossom and Leaf Grub. Taryn never asked to be the caretaker of faeries, but now that she is, keeping them in line is a job and a half.This is a great story. So strange, so fun, so much laughter. . . Just my thing. Taryn lives on a world where ‘once upon a time’ left ruins. As in, Elf ruins. She has been fascinated by the ruins since childhood, and all she has ever wanted to do is learn about the elves. How they lived, how they thought. But without a patron, there is no digging for Taryn. When a well-respected professor decides to be her patron, Taryn is at first thrilled. But then things get really weird. And everything everyone thought about the elves, their ruins, and reality may never be the same.Oops.This book was a true pleasure to read, and I very much look forward to the next. Laughter is good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HL0JNNM2LV86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5JF4GA#wasThisHelpful","R2HL0JNNM2LV86","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Reaper and the Cop is the first book in the anthology Wicked After Dark: 20 Steamy Paranormal Tales . . . I like Mina. She writes quite a bit with Celia Kyle, and I have always enjoyed their funny, relaxed writing with a heavy dose of sexy. The Reaper and the Cop isn’t as funny as some of her work, but I still enjoyed it. Laney Larsen is a Reaper. Oh, she may be tiny and human, but Reapers are darn hard to kill. And that is a good thing. Since rolling into Liberty, Oakwood (OK, is it Liberty, or is it Oakwood? Can’t figure out the whole Liberty, Oakwood thing, but that is just me being weird.) Anyway. Following the lines of what is apparently going to be a bloodbath badly in need of a Reaper, Laney finds something more than she expected. First, the Lycans are a big problem in Liberty. And second? Well, after getting her backside handed to her by a Lycan, the Young and Driven cop Laney pinpoints as her ‘in’ to the coming slaughter is quite a bit different than she expected. And when her Grimm decides to take a hike and leave her to her own devices, things heat up quickly between her and the cop. But then, when the Lycan shows up again with a bad attitude and flashing claws, things may be a lot more than they seem. And the whole cop Troy being the owner of a nice shiny silver, almost-ready-to-reap lifeline, may spell some pain in the overall.This is the first in a series, and it is now on my list. Again, it wasn’t as much fun as some of the others she has written with Celia, but I liked it well enough to mark it as “To Read” on goodreads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSN6MJN1J9Q2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INE2K58#wasThisHelpful","RSN6MJN1J9Q2J","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really liked the ones I read. The ones I didn't are YA, which doesn't make them bad, just not my tastes.Anthologies. What could be better? I have found some truly wonderful “New to Me” authors in anthologies, as well as exclusive stories by authors I love. Wicked Magic doesn’t disappoint my expectations.Dire Straits by Helen Harper. I have had Bo Blackman on my “Read” list for quite a while, but haven’t had the opportunity to try yet. This story is the first in the Blackman series, and I loved it.  We first meet Bo as she sits in a truly nasty neighborhood, waiting to serve papers on an errant halfbreed daemon. Well, needing to pee may have saved her this time. But who seems to want Bo locked away – and the world to change in cruel and terrifying ways. Helen jumps to my “Gonna Read for Sure” list. 5 of 5Dog With A Bone. Hailey Edwards. Thierry’s story is a YA. The daughter of Death, literally, Thierry has a very specialized, and very dangerous, skill. One that means she is a Paranormal Marshall – or  she leaves her home in Texas for the wilds of faerie. The story itself is quite good, though the whole “Eighteen-year-old girl finds love and hot nookie with a man decades her senior” thing sort of creeps me out. Enjoyed it, but I am not a YA lover, so won’t add the series to my lists. 3 of 5A Demon Bound. Debra Dunbar. The first in the very popular Imp series. Samantha Martin is a slum lord. Well, an Imp as well. So, the whole ‘slum lord’ thing really sort of works, right? I was surprised at how much I liked Samantha. Quirky, mischievous, and generally likable, even if she is a minor demon. Besides, anyone who loves hellhounds and horses can’t be all bad, right? 4 of 5Influential Magic. Deanna Chase. IM is the first in a series subtitled Crescent City Fae. This new series stars Willow Rhoswen, owner of The Fated Cupcake and part-time vampire hunter for the Void. Oh, and she is also a faery – complete with wings and flight capabilities. Well, when she isn’t around vampires, whose walking death drains her earth magic, and thus her life force. A very uncomfortable position to be in when your evil faery auntie, who is also the Director of the Void policing agency partners you with a vampire in order to investigate dastardly deeds by the local vampire corporation. Especially when that vampire happens to be your ‘used-to-be-human’ boyfriend. A boyfriend, who suddenly dumped you with a quick text message (jerk!), then turns up later turned – literally. I read and reviewed previously, and own the whole series. Any series that includes a Shi Tzu who turns into a wolf is worth a read! 4 of 5Forbidden. Selene Charles. In my absolutely firm intention to not read books I don’t want to (Book Reader FlameOut is a depressing!) I didn’t read this one. If you like YA, give it a try. No rating.All for a Rose. Jennifer Blackstream. Another I didn’t read. Violent naga, rich girl turned poor. It simply didn’t spark my interest, though that is no reflection on the book. It just didn’t strike my fancy. No rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JY0F15B5SCDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01681RBYC#wasThisHelpful","R1JY0F15B5SCDM","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“I am tired and sick of war. Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, for vengeance, for desolation. War is hell.” – William Tecumseh Sherman“What’s interesting about science is that we’re constantly discovering new things about the universe, about ourselves, about our bodies, about diseases, about the possibilities of the future. It’s amazing. Science is one of the coolest things about being a human being – without a doubt.” – Joe RoganScience as war. The scientists vs. the politicians. The scientists vs. the money-grubbers and the illiterate, the vain and the religious. Science has so many battles to fight. And what makes it worse? When politicians are put in charge of science. That, my dears, is war on a global scale. Because those politicians? They are looking for the glory – not for the safety of the scientists. Or even of the world.The graviton is the prize. The fate of the world may be the cost when a politician trying to hold his position decides that, safety be damned, it is full-bore thirty TeV, the maximum capacity of the Massive Anglo-American Collider, on it’s very first shot at finding the graviton particle. Let’s not listen to Dr. Emily Loughty, the scientific specialist in charge of the multi-billion dollar project. Nope. Full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes, there is political gain to be had!That’s what happens in Down: Pinhole. Henry Quint, director-general of MAAC, in order to gain political clout and keep his job as head of the project, has forced Emily’s second in command to push the collider past the twenty TeV cyclic rate all the way up to thirty – two years ahead of schedule. In one fell swoop, he had thrown safety out the window for the sake of politics.When the MAAC hits thirty, Emily disappears. Poof, between one nanosecond and the next, she is gone, and a wild man is standing in her place. A man who crashes his way out of the facility, kidnapping and murdering a woman, then going on a rampage of terror across Dartford. And in order to get Emily back, the man has to be tracked down and brought back to the same spot Emily disappeared from. The biggest problem? The man, Brandon Woodbourne, was born 15 November, 1915. He was hung by the neck until dead on the eighth of April, 1949.“The gates of hell are open night and day;Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:But to return, and view the cheerful skies,In this the task and mighty labor lies.” – Virgil, AeneidIf Woodbourne is here, then Emily is there, wherever “there” is. And to save her, John Camp, head of Security for the project and Emily’s estranged lover, must travel between space and time in order to find her and bring her back.What happens next is an amazing tale, dark and brutal, and yet absolutely fascinating, weird and twisted. It was amazing to read about how a collider works. I mean, really think about it. It works using forty thousand tons of liquid nitrogen that cools five hundred tons of helium down to -268.7C. The twenty-five thousand magnets take the temperature to 1.7 K, just barely above absolute zero. Colder than outer space. Magnetic coils wrapped in niobium-titanium filaments seven times thinner than human hairs that would stretch to the sun and back twenty five times. Then? Proton particles circle the one hundred eighty kilometer long tunnel eleven thousand times per second. When the protons collide? Temperatures five hundred thousand times hotter than the center of the sun.I mean, come on. Who figured that out, anyway??Getting Emily back, however, will require John’s skills. John, the ex-military sniper, warrior and Krav Maga specialist, will find his skills tested to the maximum as he arrives in a place called only “Down.” Down, eternally populated by those who’ve committed the most unforgivable acts of evil during their lives. Oh, yeah. Hitler is there. But also Caravaggio.* And you know what?People don’t change. What a surprise.If you like fantasy, science fiction, adventure, heck, if you are a hard science junkie with a bent for history, you really should read this book. It was, in a word, mesmerizing.Down: Pinhole is available for free through Kindle Unlimited, or for purchase for $2.99. This is part one of a three part series.NOTES:*Caravaggio was a brilliant painter whose works were much prized by the Catholic Church, and especially by the Pope. However, Caravaggio was a vain, self-centered, violent man who, on May 29, 1606, murdered a young man in a brawl and fled Rome with a price on his head. It didn’t change his ways. After major brawls in 1608 and 1609, a severely injured Caravaggio died in Porto Ercole in Tuscany at 38. His works were hidden away by the church and his name forgotten until the 20th century, when his works were rediscovered. There is no telling what he could have accomplished had he not been a complete and total jackass. What a waste.** Think what the US lost when the politicians couldn’t quit fighting over where the Massive Collider would be located in the states – so it was moved to London… Politicians.

"“All hope abandon, ye who enter here!” - Dante Alighieri“He, who had done more than any human being to draw her out of the caves of her secret, folded life, now threw her down into deeper recesses of fear and doubt. The fall was greater than she had ever known, because she had ventured so far into emotion and had abandoned herself to it.” ― Anas NinA day and a half. A few hours, cold and weary. Lost. Afraid.“In the middle of the journey of our life I found myself within a dark woods where the straight way was lost.” ― Dante Alighieri, InfernoHell truly is dark. And it opens up in the mountains above Durango Colorado, in a ghost town forgotten for one hundred seven years. Abandon. Abandon all hope, for Abandon is the home of death. The home of the darkness which fills the human soul.Twisting. Twisting.Abandon was once a thriving gold mining town, filled with people, light and laughter. “The whores, the opium, the fun”, but hey, it was the gold rush, and everything goes. But then, the gold vein faded out, people wandered away. And by the time Christmas day of 1893 arrived, and only a small number of people remain.Jocelyn Maddox, the barkeep and black widow, waiting for the snows to pass in the spring when she will be transported to Arizona to hang for her crimes.

Scott Sawyer and Jerrod Spicer, mountain guides. Emmett and June Tozer, paranormal photographers. Lawrence Kendall, university professor and specialist on everything Abandon. And Abigail Foster, New Yorker, outdoor magazine journalist, and estranged daughter of Lawrence. They have climbed to 13,000 feet, then dropped 2,000 to the ghost town of Abandon. And then, they too begin to die.Moving through the abandoned Abandon, you can almost see the town itself, in all its disintegration. Gasping in the thin, high-altitude air. The scent of firs and snow, the cordite scent of landslides. Dry rot and age. And then? Fear. Blood. Desperation. Death.Blake Crouch is a master of edge-of-your-seat suspense. Horror on a human scale. Breathtaking terror so thick in the air the reader gasps, feeling the cold upon the skin, the terror deep in the heart and mind.“Through me you go into a city of weeping; through me you go into eternal pain; through me you go amongst the lost people” ― Dante Alighieri, The InfernoEnter at your own risk.I received Abandon from the publisher in exchange for a realistic review.

Or will all his dreams come true?There are things I liked about the story, and other things that didn’t quite work for me. The book it written in first person, which sometimes works, but in this case simply led to “telling not showing.” It made the story slow going, and I found myself flipping pages to get past the boring parts. Delagrange also devolves into the trite and corny much too heavily for my tastes. For example, there is an instance at the very end, involving Laura, that was just too ‘smarmy on steroids’ for me.

"My first thought is always for quality and comfort, and these goggles offer both. The quality is solid. Good connections, high quality lenses, and a strap that isn't going to pop the first time you pull them on. The wind protection is excellent, and dust doesn't come around the sides and find its way into my eyes.Using them for hiking is great. They are very comfortable to wear and allow excellent vision in our Colorado high country sunshine.I also find them useful when I am working in the yard and working with tools.

"One day, the Great Spirit brought all creation together. . . “I want to hide something from our people until they are ready to learn.” “What is it?” he was asked.“The knowledge that people create their own reality.”Daisy O’Connor knows about creating her own reality. With a mother who drug her along like a rag doll from husband to husband, she had to become self-sufficient. Then, when husband number whatever, Running Bear, beat Daisy unconscious, Daisy and her mother left the Lakota reservation far behind. Then her mother left Daisy far behind, in Atlanta with her aunt while her mother moved with husband six to Germany.No one wanted the young Daisy on the rez – not a pale skinned, redheaded, full-blooded Irish girl. But when her adopted grandfather, Charlie Tall Tree, calls her back to the rez to help her step-brother Eddie, how can she refuse the man who was so kind to her all those years ago? And Eddie himself, the other half of their mismatched pair, “bound together by a marriage between her full-blooded Irish mother and his full-blooded Lakota father.” Eddie was always her friend, even when the other children made her life a misery. So, the Jimmy Choo wearing, southern-speaking Daisy finds herself back in South Dakota on the Piney Creek. In-and-out. Find Eddie. Solve whatever problem he has gotten himself in this time. Get back to Atlanta and her catering business. Easy-peasy.Well, not so much.What Daisy finds isn’t simple. Or nice and clean, cut and dried. Instead, she finds her much loved Eddie, but he is strange and distant, showing up to beg for her help, then disappearing just as quickly without explanation or goodbye. Only a warning.“He killed Father . . . and now he’s poisoning the rez.”The “He” is apparently Kurt Jessup, owner of the Blue Dog Trading Post, rich man and aspirant mayor of Whittier, South Dakota. And if Daisy is going to find out what is going on, and why Eddie is so certain Jessup is ‘poisoning’ the Piney Creek, she is going to have to get close to Jessup. But getting close could cost more than Daisy ever expected.I have to thank Ms. Sanders for writing such a realistic view of life on the rez. Being half Quapaw, I have walked my share of rez lands, and seen the deep poverty, the depression, alcoholism and lack of hope. The white people (of which I am half, admittedly) pushed the natives onto the poorest lands possible, where no crops will grow. Schools and medical facilities are nearly nonexistent, as is hope. But often alcohol and drugs are in easy supply, as they are on the Piney Creek in Sanders’ book.The mystery in the book is very well written, and the characters are well designed. As this is the first in what I see will be a series (I see the next book is in development, “Dead Men Can’t Dance”) and I am excited to read that one as well.

"Ah, how I love thee little bag. Strong, multiple zipper pockets. That is always the big thing for me - is it practical? Is it good quality? Will it last a long time? The answer to these I believe will be a long term yes. Now for usefulness/convenience.There are two elasticized, mesh pockets on each side, both deep enough for water bottles, with straps that will tighten down and hold the bottles firmly. The straps are wide enough that they don't dig into the skin, and there is an extra shoulder strap that will clip on to wear over the shoulder.The padding at the back is very comfortable and wide enough that it, again, is very comfortable.I really love this pack and am using it daily as an everyday bag.

"What do I like about this camera? Everything. Reliability, full wi-fi, two batteries, lightweight. It takes video as well as stills, and has a wide angle lens. You can attach it to a helmet if you are a climber or hiker, but mine is attached to my bicycle handlebars. It is rated at eight hours of use, but I don't ride that long, so there is no issue with the batteries running out for me.It is waterproof, so getting caught in the rain is no issue.

"“It was always so hot, and everyone was so polite, and everything was all surface but underneath it was like a bomb waiting to go off. I always felt that way about the South, that beneath the smiles and southern hospitality and politeness were a lot of guns and liquor and secrets.” ― James McBride, The Color of Water: A Black Man’s Tribute to His White MotherBlanche Passes Go: A Blanche White Mystery (Blanche White Mystery Series)Ahh, the “New South.” Where the ancestral mansions were built by slaves, and the moneyed want to forget that their wealth was built on the efforts of “slavers, Indian-killers, Confederate generals, and diehard segregationists. Of course, they still occasionally named their sons Braxton and Zebulon, in honor of their Confederate slaver ancestors . . . and they still didn’t invite their string of mulatto relatives with the same looks and last name to sit down at the family table.”Yep. Pretty much the same “Old South” I grew up on. And when pretty much the first thing Blanche sees when she returns to Farleigh, North Carolina is one of the privileged white trying to rape a black catering waitress in the family mansion, Blanche knows one thing. Underneath it all? The South is still the “Old South” just like before she left and moved to Boston. She left Farleigh after her own rape by a rich white man, David Palmer, but she is back now, her sister’s children, Taifa and Malik now raised and out on their own. It is time to come home, to work with her childhood friend Ardell in her catering business, Carolina Catering.“Half of it’s yours whenever you’re ready,” Ardell had told her.So, Blanche is back. And whom should she run into but David Palmer – the rich, entitled, knife wielding rapist. And all the pain and humiliation, the terror and boiling rage, come slamming back. David Palmer. He’s back in Farleigh with his wife and children, his wealth and old family history.Terror. Panic. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on steroids. “He’d already killed the woman she’d been before he raped her.” Of course, Blanche can’t get back at him to his face. The police would never listen to a black woman’s story about a white man. But surely her Ancestors will point the way.And then, the possibility for payback falls right into her lap. But sometimes, payback is a bitch. A deadly, cruel bitch with a wicked sense of humour.I have to admit, I let my timing fall off on Blanche’s story. I simply couldn’t get into it at first. But once I finally sat down and started reading, I discovered something. This is a really, really good book. Blanche is not your ‘typical’ heroine. Fifty years old, blue-black, size-sixteen and going gray, Blanch is one tough cookie. Someone I would love to emulate in my own life. She has had it far from easy in her life, but she keeps going, keeps moving, keeps doing what she wants no matter what anyone else says. That is something to admire, an attitude to strive for.This is apparently the fifth of the Blanche White Mystery Series, and I will be adding the others to my teetering piles of to-be-read. I won’t get to them right away, but when I do get to them I think I will be glad I did.I received Blanche Passes Go from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for a realistic review.

"This little burr grinder came to me via a request for review, and I am so happy it did. The grinder holds a bit over 1/3 cup of fresh beans. When ground, quite a bit more than 1/3 cup, as you can see from the photo. The grind is very fine, and good for my French Press coffee maker. The design is lovely - it will fit well into the modern kitchen.The movement is very smooth, and I am sure the ceramic burr will last a long time. The only thing that I didn't like about it is inherent in the function. As a manual grinder it took me 10 minutes to grind enough for a pot of coffee - to be expected in a hand unit. I am spoiled by my Krups! In my case, this grinder is going to be perfect for camping, bike trips, any time there isn't power available.

"I LOVE this speaker! While everyone has different levels of auditory sensitivity, to my ears the sound quality is exceptional. I am running it right now from my Samsung tablet, listening to Pandora One, and I couldn't be happier. I intend to test it out with my television as well, I have a movie I want to watch tonight, and I haven't checked the length of play yet, something I am testing now (it is rated for six hours) but the thing is, I am so happy with it so far, I had to post a ""Starter"" review.It will take me a bit to do all the tests I want to do, but it will be worth it to update the review later on what else I have tested it with. Honestly, I had forgotten that it was sitting there in ""ready"" mode as I charged it up yesterday and set it by by computer. Today, I put in a  new bluetooth earpiece and pressed ""Pair"" - and nearly jumped out of my skin when this little love paired up. Too funny! The unit has a very ""Oriental"" voice, and the sudden, very loud, (it was turned up all the way) was a shocker.A great little speaker with a full throated voice, I am so happy that DBPOWER asked me to review it for a realistic review.

"When I received this briefcase in exchange for a realistic review, I have to say - I was quite surprised. This is a NICE briefcase! At first look, it is very elegant. The buckles are bronze and fit well with the two-toned leather - darker brown on the main body, a lighter coordinating brown on the flap. The snaps which hold the straps are high quality magnetic bronze as well, no cheap silver tone snaps. When you open the flap, on the front of the body here is a zippered pouch, with a nice hefty metal pull and a pouch pocket as well. The top then zips open and displays a very nice interior lined with heavy cloth, not the cheaper, thin fabric that is more common. The laptop/tablet slot is padded, a very nice feature. There are two smaller pouches on the other side from the laptop slot for cell, etc. There is also a nice zippered pocket on the back, about the depth of my hand just to my knuckles.There is the nice carry handle on the top - very well made and sturdy. The only thing I would change about that is that I would make it padded instead of flat leather.I would have bought this briefcase for myself, or for an employee I wanted to give a very nice gift.

"I received this bag and bottle opener from TeiKis in exchange for a realistic review, but I would have been happy to purchase it myself. This is a very nice, very well made bag. It is extremely well insulated, and has a divider so you can carry two bottles without them knocking against one another and possibly breaking. You can also place a bottle in one side, and a cold luncheon in the other, and take it for a picnic. There are two handles, a longer expanding strap for carrying over the shoulder (or you can strap it to your bicycle) and a padded handle on the top (not just a strap, it is nicely padded).The bottle opener is very nice as well. The foil cutter doesn't come all the way out, it is at 45 degrees, so you can brace the bottle in and open the foil smoothly. The corkscrew has a treated black coating, so I don't expect it to rust, and the regular bottle opener works well. The black and chrome is very nice looking. Overall, a good, quality purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84UVI07EUZ4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPX9NGS#wasThisHelpful","R84UVI07EUZ4T","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I guess they were going for the funny on the covers of this seven (so far?) books. But Kelly, the heroine of the tale, is nowhere as freaky trampy looking as the female on the cover! Anyway, that is beside the point . . . ignore how freaky-deeky the woman looks (she wears a black dress for her dates, kids! LOL)But anyway. Here is the deal – this book is Funny! Did I say that already? Yep. Funny. Kelly Frank is a great character. Strong, patient, funny (yep, there is that word again) she is struggling, and struggling hard, just to survive. Living in space, paid less than a janitor, she is still doing her best and giving her all for her position as Ambassador for Earth on Union Station. The Earth is flat broke, and most of its population is off on other worlds, thanks to the Stryx Intelligence, a highly advanced race of artificial intelligence. A race who gathers up the dross of the universe, playing nursemaid to the galaxy’s lowest achieving lifeforms – a group Earth is definitely a part of. It is pretty hard to keep up when everyone has better technology, cheaper manufacturing, spaceships – well, you get the picture. But on Union Station humans are welcome, and finding a new life is, well, interesting!I enjoyed this first in the series a lot. Relaxing, humorous, and truly sweet.

"“The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis."" - Dante Alighieri – The ComedyI have found myself a little jewel in an author who has been around for a while, but I hadn’t had the good fortune to come across previously. Casey Hill’s CSI Reilly Steel is an honestly strong female character. No running around with guns or knives, kicking bad-guy’s behinds. Instead, Reilly is smart, dedicated, and determined, willing to work until she finds the solution to the crimes she investigates. And this crime is going to require all her dedication if she is going to be able to help detectives Chris Delaney and Pete Kennedy solve this convoluted crime.It begins in a rather horrific manner. The body of a well-known, and well-hated, journalist is found drowned in his own septic tank. Then, as more bodies pile up, all murdered in brutal and horrific ways, Dublin goes into a panic. Who will The Punisher, as the papers are calling him, attack next? I what brutal manner will they die? One thing Reilly knows is that the murderer is absolutely meticulous. Absolutely organized. And something is so, so familiar about the scenes he so methodically designs. But what is it?Reilly is a great character. A former California surfer girl and previous FBI ERT (Evidence Response Team) Team Leader out of the San Francisco office. She has moved to Dublin, Ireland to bring the GFU, the Garda Forensic Unit, in Dublin, up to date on sorely outdated forensic procedures. Of course, being American, and female at that, doesn’t go over well with the previous GFU leader, but be that as it may, she holds her head up and does spectacular work, no matter the idiotic behavior of some of her coworkers. She is the reason I will continue reading these stories – she is multi-layered and strong, and yet kind to everyone around her. Lovely.The story is fast paced, wickedly clever, and a well-researched police procedural. Reilly is finally getting to know her colleagues, Delaney and Kennedy, and it is interesting to watch them begin to grow their relationships, both professionally and as possible friends. It is a well-rounded tale. This is the second in the series technically, though there is a “Volume 0” – Crime Scene: CSI Reilly Steel Prequel so technically it is the third. I hope to find the time (and money, of course) to be able to read them all. My only complaint? The editing is terrible so be prepared.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0FLAIS7S4AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AXZYEA#wasThisHelpful","R2I0FLAIS7S4AB","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You will not apply my precept,"" he said, shaking his head. ""How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” – Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of the Four, ch. 6 (1890)“Okay, yes, Tez admitted that he was lowering his own standards by accepting a prayer that wasn’t couched in more flattering terms and that didn’t come served up on a bed of human sacrifice. But Whatcha gonna do? A god’s gotta do what a god’s gotta do, times were apparently changing, yada, yada, yada. – Tezcatlipoc, “I am the Smoking Mirror, the Black Tezcatlipoca, the Enemy of Both Sides!” Yeah, total Jerkface is more like it . . .Ixchel thought growing up with five older brothers was hard enough, but when they started sneaking out and coming home with bruises, blood, and items they certainly didn’t earn themselves, her heart broke and she begged them not to continue what they were doing. However, all her begging was for naught, and Ixchel was left to mourn and fret - until her wonderful, hard working parents were gunned down in their own home by enemies of her brothers gang. Turning states evidence was hard – knowing her brothers would kill her when they got out of prison if she didn’t flee was even harder. And lonelier.Now, Ixchel is far away and, having put herself through school, she is now a vet in tiny southern town, still looking over her shoulder after fifteen years, waiting for her brothers to track her down. But life as a veterinarian makes her happy, and life is peaceful.Well, until the jaguar in the tree. Then things get very interesting, very fast.Finn, the jaguar in question, has been on a quest for many years. Ever since he suddenly turned into a human and his mother and twin sister drove him away. Now, he is looking for an ancient idol, one he hopes will lead him to other jaguars like himself. Ah . . . but have a care, young jaguar, for you know not what your efforts will lead you to. Such as a lovely young woman who turns out to be a jaguar priestess – she just doesn’t know it yet. And an immature, self-indulgent, spoiled-rotten Aztec god on a mission to release himself from his prison in the idol and go on a human sacrifice rampage. Sigh. Now Ixchel and Finn are playing “god worshipers” to an adolescent god on a mission and a hunter is on their tail. Oh, and Ixchel’s brothers? Yep. They found her . . .This book was a great deal of fun. Tez is indeed a jerk – but a funny one at times, and watching the interactions of this unusual threesome is at times irritating, at times painful, and at others truly funny. This was my first Amiee Easterling, but won’t be my last. But I really hope she doesn’t continue the habit using her character’s titles as personal pronoun. Totally irritating.

"“Be Careful what you wish for . . .”Olivia Kiskey should have remembered that. I mean really – she should have learned that particular lesson when standing on the magic linoleum square by booth nine at Crazy Cousin Betty’s Waffle House granted her wish. But again – be careful what you wish for. Like when she wished on the magic square for “a little more space” from her college boyfriend, Charlie. Two days later? Yep. He dumped her for his roommate – Neal. Sigh.“A Little Night Magic” starts out funny, and Amanda Ronconi does a beautiful job of narration, her slightly nasal voice is completely believable as Olivia.When Olivia decides she is finally going to give up her crush on Tobias the cook, sell the house her mother left her, and travel to Scotland, well, people really don’t know what to think. And when Olivia finds out that she can turn objects to animals, things get really whacky . . .There are things I liked about A Little Night Magic. Olivia is a fun character – she has been stuck in a small town, working as a waitress, for years. As she says, “Spontaneity without commitment is just wishful thinking.” So, in six weeks, she is outta-there. Well, at least that is what she is planning. For a twenty-eight year old, she is very ‘young.’ So when Davina, a supposed ‘magical person’ shows up, and things start getting interesting, Olivia starts learning new things – the hard way. Davina is sure that Olivia is magical – and is determined to teach her. Hence, the whole ‘my coffee mug is now named Gibson’ thing. There are secrets, evil, a stranger chasing her – and the people she has known all her life are even stranger.Then there are the things that could have been done much better. The give-and-take between Olivia and Tobias is aggravating, to say the least. Tobias is passive-aggressive, the people trying to ‘help’ her are more harmful than helpful, and Olivia’s innocence, in my opinion, is laid on a bit thick. This is a ‘fluffy’ book – which I really don’t mind at all – but Olivia’s ‘friends’ are spiteful and the mystery was figured out within the first couple of chapters, which really doesn’t work for me. The other thing that really disappointed me? The “Bad Guy” is truly evil. And yet, instead of doing something about it, or helping others with the ability do something about it, Olivia is a complete gutless weenie loser. I mean, come ON! You have the ability to stop a murderous megalomaniac – and yet you are too cowardly to stop that person?So, Olivia pretty much ends up in the “too stupid to live” category, as others have said. And that is a shame, because the concept was good – it was the execution that let me down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB44DWGMDINV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F7NFMY#wasThisHelpful","R2GB44DWGMDINV","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a book on making organic body butters for home use, this is a good place to start. I picked it up because I got a bottle of coconut oil to test and review and wanted to put it through its paces, so to speak. These are very simple recipes, using bases such as coconut oil, shea butter, almond oil, and other organic oils along with fresh beeswax and essential oils to whip up soothing, skin nourishing butters.What this isn't is a book for what appears to be readers who expected to immediately go into business making body butters - that is a whole other arm of the organic trade. But if you are looking for a book to make butters for yourself and for gifts, this book starts out by explaining how to keep your butters clean and healthy, how to use natural preservatives such as vitamin E oil, and how to bottle and store your product safely.Very nice, with a choice of 15 butters based on coconut oil, tallow, avocado, even a magnesium flake based butter which the author touts as a relieving agent for leg cramping. I can attest that, when I started taking magnesium my leg cramps went way down, but I will have to try this out if I can get my hands on magnesium flakes. The recipe calls for magnesium flakes, coconut oil, beeswax and shea butter - a very simple recipe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UY5GA2X3WNPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGU3RDO#wasThisHelpful","R2UY5GA2X3WNPK","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Comfort: These headphones are marvelously comfortable. The band behind the neck sits comfortably, and once I got the ear pieces settled the first time, they sat very well against my head. The ear pieces are comfortable in the ear, and once you have these on they are so lightweight you almost don't feel them.Range: Range is good, in the 30M range, and they still pick up down the hall and around a corner when I left my tablet in the den and went back to the bedroom.Style: Very slick, they are small enough, but don't have the problems of a tiny set, i.e., lack of range and short battery range.Length of usage: I put these in and put on a book, then got to work. They lasted almost exactly five hours before shutting down from full battery usage.Sound quality: Excellent, especially at the price point. They aren't ""noise cancelling"" - at least not for me, but I don't like pure noise cancelling anyway for certain things I do during the day, so that isn't all that important to me. I would expect that DBPower offers a higher price point item that has noise cancelling, but I don't miss it with these. Besides, I am always afraid with in-ear buds that sound cancelling means my ears can suffer damage from having them shoved so far into the canal to cancel.

Hey, I like rubies better than diamonds, so sue me!”“Come on, who wouldn’t be thrilled to have a kick-butt, 70-something, pink-Harley-riding grandma show up on your doorstep on your 30th birthday to help you kick demon backside? Well, if you happen to be the ‘turning-thirty-preschool-teacher” hiding in the bathroom from said grandma, things can get a bit confusing, but come on. A Pink Harley? Got to love it!”“And the action only starts there. Strap your hyperactive Jack Russell into a ferret bag across your chest, hop on the back of Grandma’s Hog, (even if you do get carsick in anything faster than a tricycle) and take off for the Red Skull Hog Ridin’ Grannies biker bar, with demons in pursuit. What happens after had me grinning like a crazed biker granny myself, as Lizzie and Grandma kick fanny and take names across the American South – and a good portion of Hell.”“Night of the Living Demon Slayer” is Book Seven of the Demon Slayer Series, and I have to say, this one is just as good as the first one. I haven’t had an opportunity to read the ‘in-between’ books yet, but I was still able to read this one and greatly enjoy it without reading them. But I do have the rest of them on my list and fully intend to read them. They are just too much fun not to.This time, Lizzie and the hog ridin’ grannies, along with Pirate the talking Jack Russell and Flappy the white dragon (yep, Lizzie has all the cool pets!) are headed to New Orleans to help out Carpenter, a Necromancer Lizzie owes a favour, take out a zombie white alligator. Yep. It is bound to be exciting – and it doesn’t disappoint. Action and adventure, zombies and voodoo, oh yes – this is some great fun!Let yourself relax, open your mind to the fun, and enjoy this series. It isn’t serious, so don’t expect it to be. Just be prepared to appreciate it for what it is – a rip-roaring good time!Overall, Angie goes in my ‘must read when I am reading just for myself’ pile. She made me laugh, and her story was a pure, guilty pleasure. What more can I ask?Recommended.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a realistic review. All thoughts are my own.

"These are some off the nicest headphones I have ever tried, and they are less than 10 dollars! They come nicely packaged with a felt case and three different sizes of buds, so the fit is variable which is great. The sound is the best part though. They have a clear tone, don't hum or vibrate, and they actually block sound, unlike a lot of other in-ear brands.If you are looking for high quality and great customer service, Mengo is an exceptional company to work with. I have contacted them before regarding products and they always answer clearly and concisely and are very friendly.I received these earphones in exchange for a realistic review.

"Wow. Sugar Springs seems to me to be more of a viper pit than a town. Everyone gossips – about everyone. And there seems to be a contest going on between Mrs. G, the town’s biggest gossip, and Lee Ann London’s mother, Reba, for who can ‘scoop the most poop’ if you get my meaning. Heck, Reba even gossips about her own daughter – the daughter, by the way, who took in the twin babies of her nasty, self-centered half-sister when Lee Ann herself was just out of high school. The sister, by the way, who banged Lee Ann’s boyfriend, Cody Dalton, on the living room couch, knowing that Lee Ann was due home any minute and would walk in on the scene. And when said banging produced the baby girls, Candy and Kendra, and nasty sister Stephanie died five days after the birth, Lee Ann took them to raise as her own. Working two jobs, as a waitress in the local café in the mornings and as a studio photographer the rest of the time, Lee Ann has done a marvelous job raising strong, capable, sweet natured girls for thirteen years with minimal help from her flighty mother. They own their own home, the girls are happy and healthy, and everything is good.Until Cody Dalton comes back into town. He is only staying for six weeks, filling in for the local vet who is going on maternity leave. Cody was the local bad boy who went out with a bang, smashing windows, hooking up his foster father’s truck to the statue in the town square and dragging it behind the truck till the bumper fell off, and stealing said truck to run off into the sunset the same day he did the nasty deed with Stephanie. And now, he is back – and Lee Ann has to decide whether it is safe to let him see the girls. He told Stephanie the day the girls were born that she could just toss them into foster care, so why would Lee Ann even consider placing ‘her’ girls anywhere within the vicinity of a man who could be so cold and callous? And yet, she does.I wanted to like this book, I really did – but in the end? It was just too sugary sweet, an overdose of precious with a side of smarmy forgiveness. It doesn’t ring true, or believable. It is just flippin’ irritating.Maybe it is simply that I have had a bad run of books lately, but “Doormat” seems to be in fashion. Cody betrays not only Lee Ann in the end, but also betrays his own daughters, never mind that he has sworn that he will ‘do his best to be a good father’. And the betrayal is nasty, planned, and unforgivable. And yet, Lee Ann, and even the girls, simply roll over and take it, and it is all sunshine and lollipops and hugs and kisses within two pages.Bah. Humbug. The whole thing is just over-the-top, though I am sure other reviewers will find it, “Just so Adorable, Bless your heart!”","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1DYEPY1VLLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612186971#wasThisHelpful","R1I1DYEPY1VLLY","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neoglyphea neocaledonica (Jurassic Shrimp) belongs to an ancient group of crustaceans that were “well known from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods [roughly 200 to 65 million years ago] and were supposed to be extinct.” – Bertrand Richer de Forges, marine biologist, speaking on new finds at crushing depths off the Australian coast“Of all the reptiles alive today, crocodiles and alligators may be the least changed from their prehistoric ancestors of the late Cretaceous period, over 65 million years ago — RaresourceSo many things we do not know, have not seen, and yet, they share the planet with us. Quiet, invisible, they exist below the radar of humanity. But recently, many have been added to the species listings – most, unhappily, hitting the list as Endangered and nearing Extinction. Ah, humanity! With our poisons and hunting, destroying all that we touch.From the deep sea Dendrogramma, which literally do not fit within any existing species groupings, to two new monkeys – turtles and dolphins and even huge trees, Oh My!, there are oddities out there.But nothing (well, so far!) as odd as what appears in Crater Lake. Beautiful Crater Lake, the remains of a volcano called Mount Mazana, some seven thousand years ago the mountain exploded, magmas and ash, cinder and pumice spewing out, leaving not only the gorgeous caldera filled by the lake, but lava tubes, caves, small islands in the lake, and some of the most beautiful lands in North America. And maybe, something more.Henry Shore is Chief Park Ranger for Crater Lake – but the paperwork and politics often finds him out on the caldera rim, leading tours, rather than playing desk jockey. He is out there when yet another earthquake strikes. It is mild above ground, but when Henry leads his visitor group down the trail toward the lodge and RV campgrounds, he comes across something entirely unexpected. An uplift has opened up a dinosaur graveyard. This is devastating news for the park, as Henry expects a monstrous influx of people, fences, paleontologists and others digging up his park and destroying the serene beauty of the land. And when a staff paleontologist from the John Day Fossil Beds, Dr. Justin Maltin, shows up the next day in response to Henry’s call, there is even more bad news. First, the bones in the upheaval are nothing like he has ever seen before. Older, probably much older, than the Triassic period, 231.4 million years ago. The uproar will be even worse, and more destructive to the park, than Henry had feared. But what could be even worse? The quake was bad. And located directly under Crater Lake. The water is heating. The chance of a destructive quake rises. And it may not be just Yellowstone that is in danger of a massive eruption.Then, there are the deep, massive footprints that are showing up at the water’s edge. At first Henry doesn’t believe Ranger George Redcrow’s stories of the carcasses of savaged animals on Wizard Island. Surely it is just a bear doing the damage. When Justin points out another trail of unrecognizable, huge footprints leading into the water the next evening, surely it is bad lighting, water, anything other than something new. Unusual. And dangerous. Is Nessie, the Loch Ness monster the only one of her kind in existence? Or is there something new, something much, much more dangerous, living in Crater Lake?But soon, Henry can’t ignore what is happening. And what destroys the park may be worse than a bunch of paleontologists and lookey-loos digging up the park.We are pretty much all familiar with Jurassic Park these days – whether in book or cinema form. Dinosaur Lake isn’t that. No mad scientist labs, no greedy developers. Instead, we get something just as much fun, just in a different way. One of the things I loved about the book is how well Ms. Griffith describes the beauty of Crater Lake State Park, its history and the kind of people who call it home. The writing is good, the story creatively fantastical, and a fun read. If you are looking for something to relax with that will give you a bit of fun, give it a try. I found it a nice little read. There are a couple more of these, it is a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325OR5BRZV2DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1489520538#wasThisHelpful","R325OR5BRZV2DM","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A HORRIBLE Book with a TERRIBLE message for women!!! NO STARS! Coming out on July 20 - I suggest you avoid it at ALL costs.For me, I always wonder what’s worse: an emotional betrayal or a physical betrayal? That’s a really tough call. – Hilarie BurtonTragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise, and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life. That’s really where failure comes. – Tom CochraneIt’s particularly hard to take being stabbed in the back close to home. There’s always a feeling of betrayal when people of your own group oppose you. – Catharine MacKinnonI have begun to notice a disturbing trend in romance novels lately. For example, let us examine the case of Lillie and Nick. Totally devoted to one another since Lillie was six. Friends, playmates, companions. Then high school lovers. Then totally devoted live-in fiancées. Then, thing turn bad.Observe. Every night, after her own day of university classes and working long hours on her feet in her family café, she waits for his return from his residency shift at Baylor Medical, only to be met with cold indifference.“Maybe that’s the danger in loving someone too much: you’re so blinded by it that you can’t see what’s already over until one side of the bed is empty and cold.”Constant cold, sifting into her body, leaching away her soul. Her beloved friend, confidant, companion, lover, despises her. The man she knew no longer lives in this body. No longer talks with her.“Everything’s fine."" Or, ""If I wanted to talk about it, I’d say so."" Or his personal favorite, ""Leave it alone, Lillie.""And then one day, she learns something terrible. Something heartbreaking and devastating about her family. He adores her father, Jackson, who took the place of the father he never had. Surely he will talk with her, be once again the friend and devoted companion she has known all those years. They can find a way to work through this, right? Right? But he doesn’t come home, not until the wee small hours, long after his shift is done.Where has he been? ""Out."" The age-old response of the cheat, the drunk – or the person who doesn’t love you enough to want to come home any longer, and just doesn’t have the guts to tell you it’s over.But still, she tries to reach out to him, to draw him back to her. But.“I don’t have the energy to do this right now.” “Save it … You spend your days serving pie to people in a diner, so excuse me if I don’t see why this conversation can’t wait…”He grabbed the plate off the coffee table and threw it against the wall.Great. The introduction to physical violence, as well as emotional.Devastated, scorned by the man she loves with her whole heart, by her own family and those she thought to be friends, she packs. Packs, and leaves for the airport. She takes the first plane out, Chicago, just because, “they are boarding now, you can make it if you hurry.”For five years, she has no one to lean on, no one to hold her when she cries, to help her through her pain or help her to find her laughter again. Finally, she is successful, on a partner track with her firm, and has found a kind, considerate, gentle lover. He isn’t Nick, but he is loving, open, kind – and he is safe. Safe from the pain, the upheaval, the not knowing what is in his heart and mind, what cruelty will pour from his mouth at any moment. No icy silences. No nights of returning long hours after his shift is done with no explanation, no words. She is content. Maybe not blissfully, passionately happy. But content. Something she hasn’t been in a very long time.Then, her father, Jackson, sends a text message, and she finds herself back in Dallas, terrified for his health and safety. But, funny old thing that. The text was a LIE – a lie designed to bring her back to Dallas, to her old life, no matter her career, her coming promotion to partner in the most prestigious firm in Chicago, her life, her new relationship – no matter the agony of coming back to friends and acquaintances who blame her for leaving. Blame her for “giving up.” Well, of course. When one leaves, the other can act in any manner, say anything, and the one who left? Well.Lillie comes back to disdain and blame. To cruelty and lies, betrayal and poisoned tongues couched in “Why Suuugar… we know what’s best for you, Bless Your Heart!,"" and a constant chorus of, “It’s your fault” “What did you do to fix it?” “You gave up on him, he didn’t give up on you.”REALLY???Were they in the room all those nights he went out of his way to hurt her, when he wasn't simply ignoring her?""You weren’t patient enough. You weren’t giving enough. You weren’t understanding enough."" You weren’t you weren’t you weren’t… And of course, “It’s about you, your life, the choices you’re making."" Jackson (and everyone else, supposedly) only wants what’s best for you.”Well, what everyone ELSE thinks is “best for you.”Back to the land where women like Sullivan Grace Hasell reside – “better known as Ms. Bless Your Heart for her uncanny ability to insult the sin out of someone but mask it as a compliment swathed in a little southern flair.” And a whole lot of bullying, demeaning, snarky remarks, and lies on top of lies. For her ""own good,"" of course. . .It’s. All. Her. Fault. SHE left. SHE didn’t try hard enough. SHE  wasn’t forgiving enough. SHE wasn’t patient enough. SHE wasn’t she wasn’t she wasn’t – SHE is to blame, it is all on her, all her fault, and 'Poooor little Nick suffered oh, so much after she so cruelly walked out on him without a backwards glance and made herself a new life, and sin of sins, learned to be happy!Well, Bless Your Heart!And thus, the crux. All. Her. Fault. Her very soul was being sucked from her body by a man who showed her every day, and in every way, he cared nothing about her, considered her a burden, a lesser being, a horrible mistake made by a child that a man realizes is just that – a mistake – one he doesn’t even care about enough to tell to run back home to her father as he doesn’t want her any more.Was she supposed to reside forever upon this black and endless plain of existence, devoid of love, of kindness, of warmth? Was she supposed to stay, until and after the thrown crockery became thrown punches?Lillie was one of the bravest people I have read when she stood up, pulled up her big girl panties, and took her broken heart and shattered life and became someone completely new – someone who would not ever let herself be hurt like that again.Well, supposedly.But she still returns to find that SHE is the one to blame for “Poor Nick – your betrayal, your running away, your cowardice, broke the man, Bless Your Heart!” And the worst part? She starts to believe it. To believe that she is everything that the people who should love and support her say she is. They rip away at her self-esteem, her self-respect, her very sense of self, browbeating her, saying incredibly cruel, vicious things to her, and calling it ""friendship"" - Bless your little ol' pea-pickin' heart!And that is just Wrong.Things happened while she was gone – but instead of open, honest interaction she is faced on every side by lies, both outright and by omission. While everyone ""claims"" to care for her, no one is willing to give her respect, to accept that there was not only one side to the story. That just possibly, Lillie had to save herself when she could no longer save ""them"".Give me a freakin' break. In the words of mighty Hamlet, “therein lies the rub.” It is the woman’s fault – no matter the situation. No matter if she can no longer see the way across the night dark plains, the light has faded, and the beasts are upon her. It. Is. Her. Fault.REALLY?!?!?!Tiny parts of From Scratch are funny, touching, and positive. But the overall feel of encouraging women to return to a 1950’s mindset where emotional and physical abuse are not only commonplace but normal, where women are expected to conform to a backward society’s mores, no matter the pain to herself, is terrifying. I received this book in return for a realistic review.I wouldn’t normally be so brutal, but this book sends terrible, horrible, very not good messages about a woman’s place in society and in personal relationships – about how it is acceptable to blame women for wrongs brought on by their partners, their families, their friends. About how said family and friends are perfectly justified in blaming, lying, belittling, withholding life and death information.About punishing the victim. This could have been a funny, wise, thoughtful book – instead, it comes across as a call to returning women to the dark ages of a lack of social justice and emotional disregard.In other words? The author should be ashamed. I thought we had outgrown this sort of misogamy and social blame.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FQPHSQPCD6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X2OK#wasThisHelpful","R22FQPHSQPCD6L","A1WRXACOKPITBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WRXACOKPITBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“If cats looked like frogs we’d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember.” – ' Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies“You are what you believe yourself to be.” – ' Paulo Coelho, The Witch of PortobelloWes Rockville comes from a long line of distinguished family members. Besides the string of famous men and women in his bloodline, his sister is an eminent prosecutor in New York, his brother is the head of counterterrorism, and his dad? Well, his dad is his boss in a police division started by his grandfather. Makes it pretty darn hard to keep up when you’re dyslexic, and dad certainly doesn’t understand what that means. For his father, dyslexic simply means stupid and incompetent.But Wes works hard. Harder than his sister, harder than his ‘perfect’ brother. That is what it takes to overcome dyslexia and become a member of his father’s elite squad.But then, Wes goes on his first assignment. . . And it all goes sideways. “Don’t look her in the eye. No matter what you do, don’t look her in the eye.” Something that seems incredibly stupid. After all, she is just little old lady, apple-cheeked, sweet and cheerful. Why would you not . . .Oh.Now, Wes’s father is furious and Wes is disgraced and kicked out of the unit. His last chance? DUMBO.DUMBO? Like in the Circus?!Nope. The Department “Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.” And this is certainly no circus. Well, maybe it is. Because, Really – Witches?!Yep. Witches. Good Witches, the Davinas, will be Wes’s to protect from the Bad Witches, the Willa.Yeah, right.Only, apparently it is right – and Wes’s life is about to be turned on its head. Witches and spells, shapeshifters and things that go bump in the night are all real, and they are all determined to capture tiny little Morgan Pendragon, a Davina with a nasty bunch of women determined to get her back, and apparently take over the world.Witches Protection Program is a hoot, with a strong undernote of poking very sharp, very pointy sticks at social injustice and political manipulation. Oh, and a strong vein of Steam Punk!!! Woo Hoo!!!!!  In other words? I got a kick out of it, and I hope you will read it and enjoy it as well. This book is FREE on Amazon Unlimited, or only .99 on Kindle. Can’t beat that!I received Witches Protection Program from the publisher in exchange for a realistic review.

"“One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.” - Friedrich Nietzsche“I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.” - Robert FulghumThis dream was worse, So. Much. Worse. Than all the others. Horrifying, bloody, savage. And the worst part?It was true.Solina’s brother is dead, torn apart by a wolf-like creature. A monster who talks. Who thinks, and plans, and has yet another goal.Kill Solina. Eat her alive.A baker by trade, an introvert by nature, Solina Mundy is pulled to Alaska where her beloved twin met his end. Ostensively, to gather her brothers things and close down his apartment. Realistically? To find out what really happened to her brother. Everyone is hiding things. Everyone apparently knows things she doesn’t. And they have no intention of telling her anything – or of helping her in any way. Go Home, Little Girl. Nobody wants you here.Like. Hell. Solina is afraid, sure. She is, by nature, passive. A homebody who spends her time working in her parent’s bakery, kowtowing to their every wish. She has always left her twin, Mani, to be the adventurous one, the one who allowed her to live vicariously through his actions. But now, Mani is dead, and Solina is meeting obstacles every way she turns. Mani’s boss, Thorin, is a cold, unwielding jerk, belittling and demeaning in word and action. Val, on the other hand, is a Player, in all forms of the word. He was Mani’s best friend, and helped Solina though the first few months after Mani’s death. But now that she is there, she finds that he is more like a bull moose in rut than a real friend, and no matter how she tries to keep him in the friend zone, he keeps pushing, pushing, pushing. No respect there, only a single-minded determination to drag her into bed, no matter the pain it brings Solina when she comes to realize that he only wants to screw, not to be real friends. Val, the “Patron Saint of the Perpetual Erection.” Sigh. What a jerk. When she needs a friend as much now as she did when Mani died. Possibly even more.Then, Solina meets Skyla. A former Marine and one tough cookie, Skyla is the woman Mani loved. And she loved him as well, with all her heart. She isn’t about to let his death go unpunished. And if helping Solina will help her meet that goal, she is all over it. Sol and Skyla quickly become close friends. Which is all to the positive, as the world begins to blow up around them.You see, Solina and her twin are more than they ever could have expected. And if their enemies have anything to say about it, Solina will die as her brother did, ripped apart by a monster. And then?And then, the world will burn.This book is amazing. Really amazing. It delves into a mythology I have read very little about, and I found that incredibly refreshing. I don’t want to give things away – whatever I say will cause spoilers, and as I know my review will be one of the first ones out there, I don’t want to ruin it for other readers. Suffice it to say that it is a wonderful pleasure to watch a woman like Solina, an introverted woman who never even raised her voice in the past, much less her hand in anger, grow into someone who is learning to embrace her own power. This isn’t a Mary Sue “I was just a normal person and now I magically kick backside” sort of story. Solina takes the pain and gets up, over and over again, learning the whole way, making mistakes, and suffering for it. She isn’t stupid – far from it. Those around her, except for Skyla, treat her like she is worthless – though the whole world, and their own survival, balances upon her staying alive. Their dismissal of her Ticked. Me. Off. Which makes it even more fun when she takes their dismissal and slowly, but surely, turns it back on them.This is, I deeply and profoundly hope, the first of a series. The book doesn’t end on a cliff-hanger, per se. But there is plenty of room for the story to continue. My only problem? Now I have to WAIT for the next one!!! Sigh. That is going to be MASSIVELY difficult!!!I Highly recommend this book for those of you who enjoy a well written modern day Fantasy with a mythology you certainly haven’t read much on before (if any), well-developed female characters (yes, with an ‘s’ – there are several well developed characters here, even if one of them makes me want to slit her throat and watch her eyes dim to empty black), a creative story line and wicked good thrills.Midnight Burning was received from the publisher in exchange for a realistic review. I will have the next in the series on my Must Have list – I enjoyed it that much.If you like my reviews, please choose “This review was helpful” on Amazon, or whichever site you visit to purchase your books.

"we installed it in the office restroom. I didn't personally install it, but the person who did said that it was simple to install.  It's sturdy and easy to wipe clean while otherwise cleaning the restroom. The rolls are easy to install.

The receiver comes with a plug in power adapter, a 3.5 mm to RCA cable and a 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm cable. The power adapter wasn't an issue to me because I have surge protectors to protect my set up from lightning strikes.  There's plenty of available sockets.

"Three stars for a toy that a four year old would enjoy (packaging says four and up), five stars for a nicely made fun sort of collectible that would appeal to both older kids who love dinos and adults who also love dinos.  I've had this sitting on my desk since it arrived and everyone who comes by wants to hear the stomping sound and see the chomping action. We are talking adult professionals here.  It's electronic and battery powered-- the batteries were already installed when I opened the package-- NOT frustration free packaging may I add,  but it doesn't move by itself, have a remote or respond to voice commands like the last dinosaur toy I received.  Essentially you get a nice loud noise and some limited motion of the jaws when the tail is pressed down and the head comes up. It's enough to entertain me.It's made of both hard plastic and soft plastic.  The tail and neck are covered with soft plastic.  The legs are arms are articulated-- the arms at the shoulder but not the elbow and are independently posable.  The legs look like they have three points of articulation at ankle, knee and hip, but they do not move freely and independently.  The movement is associated with the sound.  The speaker, BTW, is in the stomach and the batteries need a screw driver to change. The toy is well balanced so when you do pose the T Rex either in the older upright position or the more recent head down, tail up position it holds its pose very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J20G1HZZL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG00FM#wasThisHelpful","R1J20G1HZZL7","A2Y739CRM15WDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y739CRM15WDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My setter tends to have seasonal allergies, and I was just complaining that he was chewing on his back again and it was probably time for steroids again.  However, when he started on this dog food he stopped chewing on himself within a few days.  Is it the lack of grain?  Don't know.

Both line and load sides can be ""back-wired"".Both receptacles tested fine with a GFCI tester. An amber light is displayed when the GFCI trips. And as expected, the GFCI trips even when tested from a downstream load-side receptacle.They're marked on the front as WR (for weather resistant) and TR (for tamper resistant) as required by code (NEC 406.8).

Unexpectedly, I found that a GFCI receptacle in one bathroom was NOT working - although it was wired correctly (i.e. grounded), and the test/reset buttons on the GFCI itself worked as anticipated. However, the GFCI wouldn't trip when tested, indicating it was faulty. This happens to be a receptacle that my wife frequently plugs her hairdryer into, and I would have never known it was faulty without this tester.

"Our dryer duct vent runs from about 30 feet (including two 90 degree bends). It used to take our electric dryer about 100-120 minutes to dry a full load, while a half-load took around 1 hour. I just installed this dryer booster last night and tested it this morning. With the dryer heat set on medium, it took 20-25 minutes to dry a half-load. That's a terrific decrease in energy consumption that will pay for the booster within 2 years. With the added bonus of saving time.It was fairly simple to install. I chose to use DryerFlex semi-rigid transition duct, and run the dryer exhaust through a secondary lint trap (Fantech). It also seemed a good opportunity to use stainless steel duct clamps.For this installation, I needed longer rigid tubing (~6 feet) for the pressure switch. This tubing has to have a 1/4 inch outer diameter. 1/4-inch OD polyethylene ice maker tubing, available from Lowes/HomeDepot/Amazon is cheap (<$3 for 25 feet), and works great.One last suggestion. I calibrated the pressure switch while running the dryer on the ""Fluff/Air"" cycle. This morning, the Dryer Booster cut in and out when I had an actual load in the dryer, and I had to re-calibrate it. It might save you time to do the initial calibration with a load in the dryer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PPXYFKNMWCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037MBG5Q#wasThisHelpful","R10PPXYFKNMWCQ","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our water heater(s) are in the attic - two stories above the bathrooms. Because heat rises due to convection, hot water in the pipes gets cold very rapidly, and we end up running a large volume of ""cold"" water from the hot water faucet, before it turns progressively hot. The Watts recirculating pump certainly solves that problem. Tepid water flows out of the hot water faucets within 10-15 seconds, and it gets warm/hot rapidly after that.I need to run the pump for the hours we're at home during the week, and all day weekends. The mechanical timer on the unit doesn't permit flexible scheduling such as this. For this reason, I have rated it four stars and not five. A second issue with a mechanical timer is that any power outage renders it unsynchronized vis-a-vis the actual time. Both these problems are especially tiresome to deal with if the water heater(s) are in a location that cannot be accessed very easily (ours are in the attic).My solution to this was to purchase an Intermatic DT620 ""heavy-duty"" indoor digital timer and plug the Watts recirculating pumps into it. It has two timed receptacles, a 15 amp capacity, and up to 4 on/off settings can be set per day. It's also possible to have different settings for weekdays and weekends. The Watts recirculating pumps appear to draw 0.2 - 0.3 amps individually - so the timer can accommodate their electrical requirements easily.One other suggestion - it is a good idea plug the pumps into a GFCI electrical socket, or at least ensure there is a GFCI socket on that circuit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TM0XGXW8FJNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E78XHG#wasThisHelpful","R1TM0XGXW8FJNA","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you wish to reduce water use in your home for economic or environmental concerns (or both), there are a number of retrofit kits on the market to convert a single-flush toilet into a dual-flush toilet that permits either a ""half"" flush or a ""full"" flush. Some of these products do not require replacing fill valve or the flapper valve body. Installing them is considerably less work and may be better suited for your needs.I chose to replace the entire mechanism inside the tank because the fill valves were 20+ years old, the flapper valve body and rubber seal were also original as were the bolts that attached the tank to the toilet bowl. I chose the FlushSaver dual-handle retrofit kit because FlushSaver products received relatively good reviews on Amazon (albeit very few reviews) in contrast to lower overall ratings for competing products. I also liked the fact that the kit came with stainless steel bolts to attach the tank to the bowl.The product seems relatively well made; as pointed out in other reviews, it would be nicer if the handles were metal and not plastic. The rubber seal on the valve body felt to be of quality, although I don't think it is silicone rubber (perhaps Water Saver Products can clarify this). The seal for the filler valve is silicone rubber. The retrofit install is a DIY project, but you should keep several things handy in addition to standard tools:1) Lots of towels - you will spill water.2) A WetVac or siphon to remove any water remaining in the tank prior to detaching it from the bowl.3) Some steel wool (if you decide to clean the inside of the tank before putting it all together again).4) A metal saw, should you have to cut through the bolts that attach the tank to the toilet bowl.I installed this kit in three toilets. Two of them took me about 45 minutes each, including 15 minutes spent scrubbing the inside of the tank. The third tank took me >2 hours and some back-breaking labor because I had to saw through the bolts. Whoever installed this tank had used aluminium nuts with brass bolts; by corrosion over 20 years, the nuts had frozen in place and wouldn't budge. Fortunately, brass is a ""soft"" metal and can be cut through relatively easily. In this regard, the new stainless steel bolts and wing-nuts are great - should be very easy to remove the tank in the future (hopefully never!).Once installed, everything worked as claimed. I estimated the volume of water used for a full and half flushes (W*L*H); full flushes take about two gallons of water and half-flushes about 30% less than that. It is simple to adjust the height of fill valve and the valve body stem. It is also very easy to adjust the amount of water dispensed for full/half flushes. One thing to keep in mind is that when filled with water the tank will sink a little on the seals, so I tightened the bolts again after filling the tank with water.A word about after-sales service from Water Saver Products. The flush mechanism on one of the three units I purchased didn't work as well as the other two. They shipped me a replacement within a day of my contacting them.I cannot comment on durability because it has only been a month after installing them. Two changes would make this product ""perfect"" - a) If the plastic handles were made of metal; and b) If it were sold through Amazon Prime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXF94LKMGHY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7RWSTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EXF94LKMGHY5","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just replaced the internal 512 GB hard-drive in my late-2012 Mac Mini with a 256 GB Vertex OCZ 4 SSD. So far, everything works really well. The replacement was relatively simple. One minor point of dissatisfaction - the screw-holes on the top of the drive are slightly off relative to the original HDD (hence the 4 stars).Also, for anyone else doing this - consider using SuperDuper! to copy the original drive to the new drive while connecting the latter to your Mac using a SATA to USB connector. You can also boot from the new drive to make sure everything works as anticipated before replacing the HDD.One other thing - shop around for the best price.

"I purchased two sets of these batteries two months ago (Dec. 2012) after confirming with Hyperion that their batteries for the GSM Galaxy Nexus (GT-i9250/Maguro) support NFC. The batteries arrived promptly and I verified using Android Beam that they supported NFC. Therefore, the batteries being shipped for at least the last month support NFC (as claimed), although clearly older versions did not.As recommended by Hyperion, I've taken all four batteries through multiple full charge/discharge cycles (discharge to the point the phone shuts itself off with less than 1% remaining battery life). So far, because the batteries are being rotated, I've charged the batteries only using the provided charger.Battery life has been comparable to that observed with the original Samsung battery, as measured using the following two parameters: 1) Both the Samsung and Hyperion batteries support about 2-2.5 hours of screen time; and 2) Under these conditions, a fully-charged battery discharges to the point of the phone shutting off in 18-20 hours. Both WiFi and cellular radios are powered the whole time, with the cell radio being used about 30% of the time. The cell radio is set to use 3G/4G when connected to the data network. I use the default display settings (automatic brightness, etc.). I have attached screenshots indicating typical battery use & discharge to this review.The charger seems to be relatively well-built; after daily use for two months the spring-loaded pins function haven't developed any problems.In summary, I am completely satisfied with the Hyperion batteries for the GT-i9250.

"Our media cabinet is small, but jammed with equipment (TiVo, BluRay player, UPS, two iOmega ix2-200 NAS, and a gigabit switch) that generate a lot of heat. The temperature within ranged from 100-120oF (yes, that hot!). The ix2-200 internal fans, which kick in at temperatures over 59oC, were constantly running at 1000-1500 rpm, and they reported an internal temperature of 60-65oC. The only ventilation in the cabinet was two 3-inch cutouts for cables near the bottom of the back panel - not very good to remove hot air passively.It may be coincidental, but about a month ago, our year-old TiVo had a drive failure. After replacing the TiVo drive, I decided to actively cool the cabinet with dual intake fans (near the bottom of the back panel) and one exhaust fan (top of the back panel).The reviews for the AC Infinity fans were excellent, so I purchased a dual AC Infinity 120 mm quiet fans for the intake (this product), and a single AC Infinity 120 mm quiet fan for the exhaust. The fans were very simple to install (and look good after installation). The cutout mask provided made it easy to mark the back panel and a I used a dremel to make the cuts. Because our media cabinet is up against a well, I need to remove the fans from the inside to clean the filters. Therefore, rather than use the provided nuts and bolts to mount the fan, I used industrial strength velcro.

"Our media cabinet is small, but jammed with equipment (TiVo, BluRay player, UPS, two iOmega ix2-200 NAS, and a gigabit switch) that generate a lot of heat. The temperature within ranged from 100-120oF (yes, that hot!). The ix2-200 internal fans, which kick in at temperatures over 59oC, were constantly running at 1000-1500 rpm, and they reported an internal temperature of 60-65oC. The only ventilation in the cabinet was two 3-inch cutouts for cables near the bottom of the back panel - not very good to remove hot air passively.It may be coincidental, but about a month ago, our year-old TiVo had a drive failure. After replacing the TiVo drive, I decided to actively cool the cabinet with dual intake fans (near the bottom of the back panel) and one exhaust fan (top of the back panel).The reviews for the AC Infinity fans were excellent, so I purchased one 120 mm fan for the exhaust (this product) and a dual AC Infinity 120 mm quiet fans for the intake. The fans were very simple to install (and look good after installation). The cutout mask provided made it easy to mark the back panel and a I used a dremel to make the cuts. Because our media cabinet is up against a well, I need to remove the fans from the inside to clean the filters. Therefore, rather than use the provided nuts and bolts to mount the fan, I used industrial strength velcro.

"We had two kinds of flakes in the water from our fridge: 1) Translucent flakes that floated; and 2) White flakes that sank. Thawed ice-cubes from the ice-maker had both kinds of flakes, and like the water it smelled terrible and was undrinkable.Thinking the translucent flakes may have resulted from bacterial/algal biofilms in the lines and the white flakes were mineral deposits, we changed the filter within the fridge, and ran gallons of water through the new filter. This didn't help - the translucent flakes never disappeared and the white flakes came back 2-3 days. Ice-cubes remained as bad as they were before (here too, I dumped at least 10-15 loads of ice made over 2 weeks).Finally, as a last resort before getting a new fridge, I did the following after unhooking the fridge from the main water line:a) Pump two liters of bleach through the fridge water lines (letting the bleach sit in the line for 20-30 minutes).b) Pump several liters of clean water to flush the bleach.c) Pump two liters of hydrogen peroxide through the fridge water line, letting it sit for 30 minutes.d) Pump 10-20 liters of clean water to flush the peroxide.e) Replaced the filter within the fridge.After reconnecting the main supply line, the water was clean for exactly two days before we started seeing very small white mineral flakes again. After reading the reviews here, I decided to install the Watts filter as a pre-filter.I mounted the filter behind the refrigerator; two problems encountered by other reviewers are that an additional supply-line (connecting hose) or a mounting bracket are not provided with the filter. Supply-lines are readily available - Watts' makes these lines that are available from Amazon. The bracket is more troublesome. I was going to fashion something crude using zip-ties when I found that 2.5 inch conduit hangers were the right diameter to hold the filter. I replaced the bolts/nuts on the conduit hanger with longer bolts/wingnuts to make loosening/tightening easier. All put together (supply line + conduit hangers), it cost about $12 to mount the filter. I've attached photographs to make my descriptions clearer.It has now been a month since the filter has been installed and the neither the water nor the ice from the fridge have flakes of either kind. The water tastes great and is odor-free.Its only been a month, so I cannot comment on the filters longevity, but so far its been great.Update - June 17, 2013It has been just over a year. Filter is still working very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D1K0SNYXNZOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E77I0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3D1K0SNYXNZOB","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edited Review - October 30, 2012:The switch worked well for ~7 months. Toward the end of September (i.e the 7th month after purchase), a NAS (or a TiVo) connected to one of the ports would disappear off the network, even though the light indicating connectivity was lit. Connectivity was restored by plugging the ethernet cable into another port, or powering down/up the switch. So I stopped using that port. As of yesterday, the same symptoms have appeared for another port. Therefore, I am replacing this switch with another brand. I no longer recommend its purchase.Original Review:This switch works very well, and is a real deal for the price. I purchased it as an open box item from Amazon for about $14 + shipping. In my setup, the switch is connected to a wireless router (Netgear WNDR3300 running dd-wrt) via a 100 mbps connection. File transfer rates between ""gigabit"" peripherals connected to the switch are excellent - ranging from for 60-90 megabytes per second (i.e. ~450-750 mbits/sec). Those rates are particularly amazing as they do not take TCP/IP header overhead into consideration. The switch supports jumbo ethernet frames up to 15kb in size, and our peripherals use jumbo frames up to 9 kb in size.Connecting all the peripherals to a dedicated switch rather than the router has yielded a benefit I didn't anticipate; it has improved router performance, probably because the Netgear WNDR3300 is memory and processor speed limited (16 megabytes, BCM4704 CPU @ 264 MHz).Speedtest results used to indicate download rates of ~15-18 Mbps, and upload rate of ~3 Mbps. After connecting everything to the switch, and with a 100 Mbps connection between the router and switch, I reproducibly observed 24-28 Mbps down and ~3 Mbps up (10 trials over 2 days). This increase can be attributed solely to the switch because connecting everything back to the router returned download/upload rates to those observed previously (three trials over 20 minutes).Apparently, off-loading the processing power and memory necessary for switching to a dedicated switch ""frees up"" the router. I'm not implying that the switch has magically increased the bandwidth provided by my ISP; it most certainly hasn't. I think that ""off-loading"" bandwidth ""distribution"" to a dedicated switch lets the WNDR3300 function better vis-a-vis processing packets to/from the cable modem it is connected to.If this observation can be generalized, its quite spiffy considering it has cost <$20 in total.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XTDQ9ATJZ5CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MF1BZW#wasThisHelpful","R1XTDQ9ATJZ5CS","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This enclosure does what it is supposed to. I tested RAID0 and RAID1 modes with two Seagate Barracuda Green ST2000DL003 2TB drives. The drives SATA interface supports a transfer rate of 6 GB/s, but the enclosure's controller supports maximum transfer rate of 3 GB/s. Everything works (including rebuilding a RAID1 array). I've only had the enclosure for a few days, but there are a couple issues that one should be aware of:A) For whatever reason, RAID1 read/write times are better when the drives are formatted as FAT32, rather than Linux ext2 or Mac HFS.B) Processor power in the RAID1 is limiting; practically speaking, read/write times with journaling file-system like Linux ext3 is _significantly_ slower than Linux ext2, which is not journaling. For example, copying 1.5 TB of small/large files (mp3 and movies) took about 4 hours when the drive was formatted as ext2, and about 5 hours when it was ext3 formatted.I had expected ""B"". In the late '90s, when desktop CPUs were slower, ext3 was often slower than ext2. ""A"" really surprised me; I need to repeat it to confirm the observation.The cooling fan isn't as loud as I expected it would be. I have the enclosure contained within an entertainment center and the noise isn't particularly noticeable.Overall - at a price point of $50-60, the enclosure meets my expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N10N2P5GWWM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KKXLLG#wasThisHelpful","R1N10N2P5GWWM5","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are very few options currently available to record over-the-air (OTA) TV in HD, namely the brite-View BV-980H Digital Antenna HD DVR and the Channel Master CM7400 1080p Internet Compatible HDTV DVR. The brite-View gets horrible reviews - for example the enhanced programming guide (EPG) is very slow to load, the interface is difficult to navigate, and scheduled recordings often don't record. The initial reviews (as of January 10, 2012) of the CM7400 aren't very promising either.So, that leaves a single choice - the TiVo Premiere series of HD DVRs, which provide 7 days of EPG to schedule recordings - using the name of the show. The TiVo works well for this purpose, and the interface is intuitive.  To use the TiVo you have to purchase service; we found it convenient to get the product lifetime service ($499), along with a 3-year warranty. All put together, this cost $617, which works out to ~$17 per month (over 36 months). Presumably the warranty will let us get more than 36 months of service, and there are plenty of 3rd party options to fix a broken TiVo, install a larger HD etc.Monthly service is currently $20, although occasionally TiVo offers a $10 special for exclusive OTA recording. At $20/month, three years of service would be $720 + the initial cost of the TiVo Premiere. Therefore, if it is possible, lifetime service is a good service option to consider.The TiVo Premiere downloads the EPG using an ethernet connection, or a WiFi adapter (sold separately) - the TiVo AN0100 Wireless N Network Adapter. The video outputs include HDMI, component and composite video - but there is no S-video output. Audio outputs include HDMI, digital audio (optical), and regular stereo. E-SATA and two USB ports are also available - for expansion, adding a WiFi adapter or a phone adapter (also sold separately). You can record encrypted cable if you have a Cablecard from your cable provider, as there is a cablecard slot.The TiVo remote is well put together, but it was more convenient to use a Logitech Harmony Universal Remote because it controls multiple devices at the same time - setting the proper inputs on each etc.Be aware that the TiVo stays on all the time, and I haven't yet measured the current draw.The Premiere picks up the same list of channels as the TV did when connected directly to a Mohu Indoor HDTV Antenna. It has two tuners - making it possible to record one show while watching another. Our primary uses for the TiVo are to watch PBS documentaries/shows and college/NFL football - they tend not to be at the same time. However, dual tuners can be very useful to others.No complaints at all. It would be nice there were additional OTA HD-DVR options available as ""competition"" against the TiVo. The anticipated price for the CM7400 is $399, and $50 (or $100 - depending on where you look in the ChannelMaster website) for annual EPG service.If you want to transfer TiVo recordings to a DLNA server, mobile device, or tablet, google ""kmttg"". It's free, and does a great job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOSE9AN8DNF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036OR910#wasThisHelpful","R1IOSE9AN8DNF1","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The many positive reviews here persuaded me to purchase the Mohu Leaf Antenna for over-the-air digital reception. While I don't have another product to compare it against, I'm very satisfied with the Mohu. It arrived within a few days of the order; I initially positioned it on the wall behind the TV and received about 15 digital channels and one analog channel. We didn't feel that it was aesthetically pleasing in that location; because there is a run of coaxial cable from the wall behind the TV to the attic, I positioned the Mohu in the attic. After fiddling with the positioning for 5-10 minutes, the Mohu permits us to receive 28 channels, of which 26 are digital. The number of digital channels exceeds what is predicted by antennaweb.org for an indoor antenna. Most of the broadcast towers are south-east of our home, and the best position seems to be when the flat surface of the Mohu faces that direction.I thought it would be useful to others in general vicinity of New Orleans/Metaire/Kenner to list the channels received using the Mohu antenna:4.1 WWL-HD (CBS)4.2 LIVEWEL6.1 WDSU-DT (NBC)6.2 ExactWX8.1 FOX8 HD (FOX)8.2 FOX8 SD12.1 WYES-HD (PBS)12.2 WYESSD112.3 WYESSD318 - Analog Channel (weak reception)20.1 WHNO-Digital20.2 WHNO-D2 Digital22 - Analog26.1 WGNO-DT (ABC)26.2 AntTV28.1 KNLD-LD32.1 WLAE-1 (PBS)32.2 WLAE-232.3 WLAE-338.1 WNOL-New Orleans CW38.2 THISTV41.1 KNOV-DT42.1 KGLA-DT47.1 HSN49.1 WPXL Digital Television49.2 WPXL qubo49.3 WPXL ION Life54.1 WUPLThe broadcasting towers for these stations are between 4.7 and 25 miles away from our home (most are 11-12 miles away), and the area is pretty flat. There are a couple taller structures within 1000 feet of our location. Because it is positioned in the attic, the antenna is approximately 25 feet above ground level.There is one ""negative"" I want to point out - the photo of the antenna makes it appear that the the surface is a flat/matte/satin black. It isn't - the laminate on both sides renders the black and white sides glossy.Edited 12/4/2011: I added a TiVo as an OTA HD DVR between the antenna and the TV, and found that reception turned sour for ~5 channels, even though the position of the antenna wasn't altered, and length of cable between the antenna and TiVo was exactly the same as was between the antenna and TV (in fact it is the same run of cable). Upon re-positioning the Mohu to be closer to one of the outside walls in the attic reception through the TiVo returned to that seen previously. The TiVo Premiere lets you measure the signal strength per channel, and they are all between 50 - 98 now (scale 0-100). Anything above 50 is green. Most channels are between 70-85.Its no surprise that antenna position alters reception, but I was surprised that the quality of tuner varied so much between the TiVo and the Philips TV previously connected directly to the Mohu. So it is likely that your experience with the Mohu will be dependent on the OTA tuner in the device it is connected to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UICGT2EEYAUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QK7HI8#wasThisHelpful","R2UICGT2EEYAUQ","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this charger with a replacement PowerGen Battery for my Nexus One, as well as the OEM HTC battery.  The charger automatically detects polarity, and its movable charging pins makes it easy to charge a variety of battery formats, as long as the contacts are on an edge. The LED color changes from red to blue when the battery is fully charged.I have no complaints at all.  However, before purchasing it, you need to be sure of two things:a) That the charging contacts for your battery are on the size (i.e. one of the edges), and not on the flat surface.b) That charging at 600 mA is sufficiently quick for your needs.  At this output it can take 8 hours or longer to charge a 1400 mAh battery.  For example, the output of the OEM charger for the Nexus One is 1 amp (i.e. 1000 mA), so it charges the battery a lot faster.The slower charging rate doesn't matter to me; my needs are to charge the battery to full capacity overnight.  Before using it the first time, I did confirm the voltage output was a steady 4.2 volts, and current output was 600 milliamps.  The USB output is supposed to the 5 volts, but I didn't measure this.I am a little concerned that the charging pins look a little fragile, but in 2.5 months of daily use, they have held up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU8WJGTOPQ7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B8ECR4#wasThisHelpful","RNU8WJGTOPQ7S","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HTC battery in my Nexus One lasts about 8-9 hours with heavy use, so I bought this Powergen battery as a backup battery.  After an initial extended charge and full discharge cycle as recommended by Powergen, I find that it lasts at least as long as the OEM battery (maybe marginally longer).I have no complaints and recommend it.A couple suggestions:1) Root your phone and use SetCPU - it can dramatically extend battery life, especially under heavy use.  With light use (email, browsing for 1-2 hours, 4-5 phone calls for < 10 minutes each), the battery charge decreases from 100% to ~50% in 24 hours.  It takes a day or two to figure out a SetCPU configuration that works for you.  With really heavy use (described below), the battery charge decreased from 100% to ~20% in ~9 hours, at which point I'd switch batteries.2) Get a PowerGen Rapid Battery Charger. Works great.  I was out of town for about a month, and relied exclusively on my phone for email, browsing, editing small documents, and off course phone calls.  One battery would run from about 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM, and the second battery would go to about 40% by time I went to bed (~10:00 PM).  I'd charge one battery overnight in the phone, and the other in the Powergen charger.  Worked great!Overall, this has worked as well as could be expected.The battery and charger run about $14 each.  Not bad at all, considering that an HTC-branded battery alone is much more than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45R9YRODCVIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZUQIT4#wasThisHelpful","R45R9YRODCVIT","ASH4COAK80Q73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASH4COAK80Q73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"IT WORKS. I had no idea a primer could grab so much powder! I got it for eyeliner pencil that kept disappearing, and it helps everything stay put. It doesn't have a lot of drag when going on. Since it starts creamy I've had to set it with powder to avoid creasing, but be careful! You only need the smallest amount and it will take layers of powder, be careful not to put too much eye shadow on because this will grab it. This is good if you want to cover up the light tint completely with a color. I'd suggest carefully applying it just exactly where you apply your eye shadow.I also tried it under my eyes and in the inner corners to enhance concealer. It certainly works and my dark circles were covered all day. But the primer, concealer and powder combo brought out little eye wrinkles (I used it with Lancome concealer and Tarte Smooth Operator face powder).Color: Despite the photo looking flesh toned, this does look almost white going on. I have very fair skin and wear physical sunscreens that leave me even whiter, but it was still too light. That said, you don't need much. A tiny bit applied smoothly is not very visible. I do apply it before anything else to blend or cover with sunscreen or foundation.The reason for this is partly because it has mineral sunscreen as an ingredient (titanium dioxide). Which is a bonus if you don't want eye wrinkles long term.Compared: I also bought the elf eye primer at the same time and this is superior. Gabriel primer takes less and has an even, smooth consistency. Again, it holds a lot of powder too.Sensitivity: I have very sensitive eyes, they are often itchy and irritated even if I haven't worn makeup for weeks. So all eye makeup is a bit irritating, but this primer doesn't cause itching or burning or swelling- nothing that I don't experience with all other makeup. My eye makeup stays on better, but it does require a make-up remover with this primer.Gabriel line: New favorite! It's natural, non-toxic, non-irritating. The Gabriel liquid foundation has really impressed me too. It feels good on my face, almost like there's nothing there, not dry or stinging or greasy. Aside from my rose cream there is no other product doesn't irritate my some level. Gabriel foundation is moisturizing, it has some sun protection, and the color is really amazing; warm and pigmented, but not yellow like so many other natural foundations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8WXBU9LGNBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDYPUYQ#wasThisHelpful","RN8WXBU9LGNBI","A38RVHADJCQU7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38RVHADJCQU7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The color (teal) is very nice. The fabric is stretchy, substantial and not clingy. The cut is flattering. Sizing is forgiving because it has a lot of stretch, and it retains it's shape very well.

"I needed this item. But it is NOT well made, NOT sturdy. While the concept is a good one (it's nice looking and functional?) it is deceiving. I didn't watch the first reviewers video- so it's smaller than expected. 4 inches tall, and longer WITHOUT the usable space to match. It's a little over 4"" wise, there is less than 3"" of usable space. I can fit one, maybe 2 TV controllers in a spot, then they fall over because it is too short. Good for storing styluses, and travel size hand lotion, or even a nasal spray. MAY work for pens and pencils, but only if you have a big collection so they can't lean. Don't even think about small items like thumb drives because you are not getting them out without tweezers or turning this mess upside down.Good for storing styluses, and travel size hand lotion, or even a small-medium prescription bottle.So the main issue is poor design. The 2 sides that pull out are very thick and do not slide straight; they are loose but also awkward to pull out. Loose like they were measured wrong. It wobbles and is crooked, but looks like they intentionally used the wrong measurements. The cool looking spaces are not practical.It is not as nice looking as the photo, and does not work well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGD89XIRQJFBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FB6TRG#wasThisHelpful","RGD89XIRQJFBA","A38RVHADJCQU7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38RVHADJCQU7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice, but of course not what they used to be. They still look cool, people notice and complement. But not as beefy as the originals in the 80s.The shell top starts at the top of the sole, not covering the whole toe, and is thinner rubber. Also, the upper is thinner, and will undoubtedly wear out fast. They have no arch support and less cushion in footbed, but good ankle support. A little narrow, but true to size. I had the first run of the original shoes so I don't know when quality went down, but it was probably when the price went down.I guess I'm saying: These look good and are comfortable, but if I skated in these they would be destroyed in a month- beyond the help of duct tape and shoe goo.With casual use as a sneaker, I expect them to last 3-6 months tops.

"If you don't have a huge room and don't mind the noise this is a nice little humidifier, especially for a child.First thing to know, you cannot see the steam, but it produces humidity. It is probably a better output for my relatively small bedroom than the Ultrasonic, but has some drawbacks.Pros-The star lights, especially on my slanted ceiling.  They don't spin, but do change color like a kaleidoscope. It would be nice in place of a night light.-You're not going to over-humidify a child's room. It is the right size and a nice shape.Cons-It is very bright, even with the star lights off (the knob lights up a lot)-It is Loud even with earplugs. I had trouble sleeping with it on.-It has a filter that needs regular cleaning and changing, even if you use distilled water.So in contrast, my regular unit is a Vicks Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier that is the bomb. It can steam up my bedroom like I took a shower. It is quiet and only has one light that is less bright than my clock radio. I change the little box filter every 3 months, but it hardly needs cleaning if you use distilled water. I've had it 2 years and when my hard water (I used a filter and filtered water) slowed it down with limescale, the company sent me a new or fixed one. It seems new.

"Exactly what we needed. Installed it as a liner behind our fabric curtains. We have a nice, big antique tub with a single pipe going up to the shower head. We installed a screw-on brass soap dish, but there is no where for shampoo, body wash, etc. So much easier than putting the bottles on the floor of the tub for every shower.Now my shampoo and conditioner and body wash and loofah and comb are all easily reachable without bending over.

"PRETTY: I do like this top, but I expected the sleeves to be more flowy like the bottom. It is really cute, I bought a smaller size in a different color too because the embroidery and colors are nice. It would disguise a flabby mid-section or tummy.WEIRD FIT: The arm holes are super tight- you can't wear them as it unless you size way up and have skinny arms. I will take the seams out and make them split sleeves. My arms are larger than average, and most tops are tight across my shoulders, but this is ridiculous. The bust is as snug as I would want it, but it is loose around the hips. My body type is (though large at the moment) fairly well proportioned with larger bust and hips than my waist. It might work better for a pear or apple shape.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HVLMNLVC2RSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IH060E0#wasThisHelpful","R2HVLMNLVC2RSI","A38RVHADJCQU7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38RVHADJCQU7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had one of these for years and it is the best purse I've ever had. It's a perfect size; not too small, not too big to lose things, good pocket placement and size (inside and out help you keep track of stuff). A cell or sunglasses easily fits in the outer zipper pocket. I get compliments on my green one all the time, it's cute.The best part of it is that it very quickly and easily converts into a chic backpack (much cuter than any other backpack I've seen). This is ideal for shopping, walks, festivals, anytime you need your arms free. It is not too heavy. I don't usually spend this much money on purses, but I see it as an investment.I think the magnet is perfect- It secures the bag enough, as there is no zipper. It's fast and easy access with enough security that you would feel it if someone was messing with your bag. The leather is soft and the liner fabric is quite nice too.The only thing that bothers me about this newer version is that the straps have that plastic stuff on the edges of the leather. It always ends up cracking and peeling and it looks a bit cheap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0AX85EX7RKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JDKQWW#wasThisHelpful","RA0AX85EX7RKG","A38RVHADJCQU7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38RVHADJCQU7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my husband for work, his belt has been bothering him since he had surgery so I thought something with some stretch would be better. No stretch but apparently they fit him perfectly so he doesn't need a belt. The 40 actually measures 41"" at the waist. I think people think they are small because of size inflation (it's a real thing!).For cargo pants, they look awesome. Neither of us are fans of sloppy cargo pants, especially in public. He looks goooood in these. They are trimmer in the leg and the pockets are sewn to not stick out, but long enough to hold a pruning saw and leather work gloves, maybe a soda.

"I know how desperate you are to find help when suffering with Fibromyalgia, so don't waste your energy reading this book. I have been following a very similar protocol for over 8 years, for my own reasons (eating anti-inflammatory diet and taking guaifenesin for allergies congestion).I have since been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and most days I can't even hold a up a book and read for more than 30 minutes. And sorry, but Vicodin, Flexeril and Modafinil have really helped me on bad days. Reducing stress and regular movement are even more effective.Mucinex or guaifenesin can help with some allergy symptoms and congestion. If that's why you feel awful, you lucked out.Please don't vote my review ""unhelpful"" simply because you have a differing opinion. I tend to find this kind of bullying when I review books with bogus cures.

"The worst part is the awful scratchy fabric. It's rayon/linen blend, but it's the horrible rough kind of linen and enough rayon to have a sheen. Just trying them on I felt my thighs getting rashy.They don't look, feel, wash or breathe like linen pants. I buy basic linen pants almost every year, I'm familiar with how quality linen feels.CUT: The cut is SO unflattering. I like a high waist, but these are drawstring and 4 inches above my waist, which doesn't actually work in practice. Super saggy bottom and crotch with tapering towards the ankle. My friend laughed when I tried them on. I wanted a strait leg/ palazzo, not old lady meets MC Hammer pants.These are about 2 sizes too large, maybe more. Really. Mixed reviews confused me.RETURN: Not only did I have to pay return shipping, but a restocking fee! And it's their fault that the sizing was off and the product was inferior, misrepresented and over-priced. I paid $40 for something unwearable and got $30 back. I didn't know Jessica London was the same company as Woman Within or I would never have ordered from them. One star because they are pants, they are black, and they have pockets.

"This dress is a very lightweight, somewhat see-through fabric.  I was expected the thicker polyester scrubs-like fabric (they still call it cotton) that many of these are made from, but this seems to have more cotton and is thinner- good for summer. I still doubt the 100% cotton claim.The only real problem is that the seams are all unfinished, so if I wash it (and I must as it reeks of clothing preservative) the fabric at the seams will all unravel like cut-offs do unless I fix them myself.I have a similar dress that is a little small on me, so I ordered 2 sizes up to a 3x. That was a mistake. Stick to your size. I expected it to look like a sack anyway, and it does. I'll probably put some elastic in the back of the waist or sides when I finish the seams. This is just a summer house dress for me.I wanted a toned-down version of my smaller bright blue Mexican dress so I went for this khaki, but it just makes the embroidery look gaudier and the dress looks a lot like a giant paper grocery bag. On the other hand, there is a lot of embroidery, including on the back shoulders.I would have been happier if I had paid less.

"It's magic fabric. For years I've only worn filament silk, or nothing. In a week I'm converted. The give-n-go fabric feels like silk, or almost nothing, same thing. It's more sweat absorbent and longer lasting and more stretchy than silk. Another reviewer said the cut changed, but these women's briefs had a lot more fabric than I expected- over the belly button and into granny pantie status.

"The hat is just too small, but I like everything else about it. I wear a women's medium in hats, and other San Diego brand ribbon hats have fit a little loose; which I prefer so I don't get hat hair and have some air circulation. This hat is not just snug, it's tight enough to be uncomfortable. Having bought multiple hats of the brand, I thought sizing would be consistent. And I tried loosening the ""adjustable ribbon"", it made no difference.Otherwise it's exactly what I wanted: wide brim that is shape-able and stands out straight if you want (I want!). UV protection for scalp and face. Wide range of colors. Suitable for casual beach or nice parties. Lightweight with some stretch. So cute on me.

"Especially in the middle where you want your knees to be. 2.5 stars because after a little modification it is great to have a body pillow for adults over 4.5' tall. But they basically took two of those cheap, short ""body pillows"" and put a long cover on them. There are two distinct lumps of batting/fill on either end. So you can push them together and sew up the extra length or do what I did, This will probably flatten out quickly as the fill is really cheap. I added more fill (of a higher quality) after the first option made it a little too stiff.  It does NOT come with an extra cover as one reviewer said. So I made my own cover out of an old sheet. At this point, I think the price is too high in comparison to other body pillows.Someone complained of headaches, I assume they were using this under the head as the photo shows. I don't use it that way and find it very comfortable from the neck down, I wake up feeling better. And I prefer down head pillows, so I wouldn't even consider this for head support. I was just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Lupus and this pillow is helping me get the sleep I need.It helps your joints and supports side sleepers.

But I like the much larger selection of designs on the originals. I bought two that looked more like scarves, the ginko camo-colored leaves and the black and white tree branches. They are nice, especially the Ginko was a nice surprise (aside from the obvious Buff logo on them in 4 places).

"UPDATE: OK, I'm not a super light nerd who bought 10 different bulbs and took photos, sorry. ButTHESE ARE AWESOME. I see why they might want to limit people. I bought 4 different LED brands. These had a nice warm light very similar to my old incandescent bulbs. The whiter ones were just so harsh, one I just had to return. These are warmer than the other LEDs I bought, including the Philips ""urinal"" shaped bulb.It's been months of daily use and not one has burned out. Plus, they are smaller than the old bulbs so they will fit in any normal fixture (not candelabras). In addition to knowing they will fit your fixtures (even my ceiling fans), they have a textured surface to make them easier to install AND they have good ""spread"".

"This crossbow took about two hours to assemble, but the process was fairly simple using the wrenches supplied.  The last step is to install the string, which requires you to cock the bow using a longer string supplied.  This is where we discovered that we could not make the rope cocking device work, so we just had to cock it by pulling the string directly with gloves on.  This is not easy! Now that it is assembled, we have to cock it that way every time.  It does shoot well, and is accurate enough to make one inch groups at 20 yards.  The trigger is smooth, and the red dot scope is plea try bright.  You will want different tips for hunting.  This bow would be very adequate for taking deer out to about 75 yards. The bow mounted quiver holds six bolts snugly.  Except for the cocking issue, this is a nice crossbow and not too expensive.  Check your local regs to see if you can use this during archery season.Update:  once we found an online video explaining how the rope cocking system worked it got much easier.

"This unit is perfect for a small business or even a home network if you have a fairly large quantity of data to protect.  As a professional photographer, I have a lot of photos, and they take a lot of room.  This was easy to install.  Just plug it in and connect it to your network with the supplied cable.  I connected it directly to my router, but it can be connected anywhere on the network.  Then run the software supplied on the included CD and you are ready to go.  The cabinet is solid, and it will keep your data backed up.  As always I suggest at least two backups to two different places.  We also do periodic data backups to a hard drive located in another computer on our network.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7UJZR2ELXC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG9TGUE#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7UJZR2ELXC0","A12O5SEIF162P8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12O5SEIF162P8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very high end power supply suitable for a powerful server or serious game machine.  It has 750 total watts, and can power multiple hard drives as well as high end video and sound.  It is very full size, so it won't fit in a compact case.  The wires serving the various devices are separate, and plug into the back of the power supply as needed, so you don't have loose cables lying about.  The supplied cables seem very high quality.

"Gene Kelly was once asked why musicals were no longer a staple of modern movies and he said something to the effect that “no one knows how to make them anymore.” (This was a short time after he appeared in Xanadu. Today, only a precious few know how to do it: the producers and director of Into the Woods.This is as close as any contemporary movie has come to making a musical that most audiences can see—the caveat being that Into the Woods is a mature twist on fairy tale characters and not for the purist or the very young. Disney toned down the sequences with Red Riding Hood and the Wolf as well as the Baker’s Wife and Prince Charming to the point that things are very obtuse.That all said, Into the Woods has a lot of comedy, one of Sondheim’s most melodic scores and a brisk pace (kudos to director Rob Marshall for that). And to be fair to the subject matter, one can watch the network series Once Upon a Time and see the evil Queen pulling hearts out of her victims and a naked-under-the-sheets Show White and Prince Charming interrupted in the middle of, as my dad used to call it, “spoo-ja-doo,” only to exuberantly resume after their company leaves.A lot of attention has been awarded to the biggest stars of the film, so let’s focus on others who also deliver remarkable performances—no mean feat in a musical film, especially one with the challenging music and lyric structure of Sondheim.James Corden is the emotional center of the film and the character with whom the audience most connects; Christine Baranski makes every syllable and gesture count as always as one of the big screen’s best evil Stepmothers and Tracey Ullmann brings superb comic timing to a somewhat thankless role (she and Baranski could have played any number of roles in this musical). As one of the stepsisters, the astonishing Tammy Blanchard makes one forget she also played Karen Carpenter and Judy Garland. Even Hagrid’s girlfriend turns up as the Giant’s Wife.Once again, a modestly-budgeted movie proves that less money and tight time frames (and less indulegence) can result in fine, profitable films. The art direction and costuming has a painterly quality, very much as if it came from an Arthur Rackham book.What Into the Woods is not is cozy and comfy. Yes, there are songs like “No One is Alone” that offer solace and reassurance, it’s almost an anti-fairy tale in the familiar sense (the original fairy tales were quite dark). Many, many messages flow out of the lyrics: “Life can be unpleasant you should know,” “I’m not good, I’m not nice, I’m just right” and “Nice doesn’t always mean good.”The Blu-ray contains an audio commentary (thank you!) and several interesting behind-the-scenes vignettes, making this a fine package, especially when combined with the deluxe edition of the soundtrack (with all the songs and music).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K06ZCX5IJVUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7WBFTA#wasThisHelpful","R3K06ZCX5IJVUS","A2UBSGFCP2QFNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBSGFCP2QFNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch has a nice gold tone round face with numbers you can clearly read. The band is fabric, kind of like grosgrain ribbon. It is ivory in color and designed to be reversible so that it is plain on one side and has gold metallic dots on the other. The beauty of this band is how easy it is to take off and put on. It is easy to clean with mild soap and water. The watch also has the normal pin type band fasteners if you prefer a different type of watch band. This watch is functional and attractive and has the added bonus that you don't have to pull your phone out of your pocket to check the time!

"Right off the bat I need to say that the box art for this game is very misleading. The picture on the box shows real cupcakes with real candles on them and the tagline ""A Game For Fans of Checkers…and Cupcakes!” It looks like a children’s baking set or that you actually play checkers with real cupcakes. Admittedly, the back of the box shows the actual playing pieces but that is not what you see at first and some parents might back off from it thinking it involves baking and playing with real cupcakes, yikes!The game definitely would appeal more the girls than boys due to the cupcake theme (especially the pink frosting). That being said, the game is pretty much a straight forward checkers game with the exception of the popping dice. There are three dice in the popper with an image of either a chocolate candle or a strawberry (pink) candle. When it is your turn, you pop the dice and you get three moves based on the color of the candles revealed. What this means is that you can move the other person’s cupcakes. The controller of the popper controls the entire board for their turn and therefore can move the other player’s cupcakes backward of otherwise make the board more favorable to them. If you do ever manage to get your cupcakes to the opposite side of the board they are “kinged” with a foam candle and can no longer be moved by the other player.There are two disadvantages to this from my perspective. The first is that it can make the game take much longer to play which is an issue for me as a parent. The second (and this is subjective based on your child and your child rearing philosophy), the negative aspect of moving and 8 year-old’s (this is the minimum age recommended for players) cupcake back can be problematic. Of course, the objective of checkers is to jump and take all of your opponent’s pieces to win the game and playing games is one of the earliest ways to teach kids to be gracious losers, I get that. My issue is that frustration is not usually one of kids’ easiest things to learn to cope with and constantly having your piece moved back to where it came from. It is obviously an individual call on this. Personally I see these cupcakes being repurposed for a very cute tea party and that would be fine by me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2953LLUGWB0AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O59BZ1U#wasThisHelpful","R2953LLUGWB0AO","A2UBSGFCP2QFNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBSGFCP2QFNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this primarily for my son because we always buy Pocky when we can find it. (They sell it at Epcot.) My daughter found the cream taste a little too much like white chocolate, but we enjoy the buttercream taste just fine.Pockys can be habit forming, and there is the danger of grabbing a fistful and stuffing it into one's mouth.

"I wasn't sure about this hose at first but after using it I am a big fan. It is very thin and flexible and because of it's light weight it is easy to get to all the places in the yard that need watering. I initially thought it was not all that kink resistant until I realized it was how I was handling it that was the problem. Now even if it does kink it is very simple to give the hose a little ""flick"" to unkink it easily.

"We were very exciting to set this up and see how our puppy liked it, as she loves being in cubbyholes and under blankets. Assembly was hard at first, because the instructions did not make it clear that you have to slide the poles through the corner openings and then fasten them across with the top bar. i spent a while trying to get the side bars to stay up and there was no room, until I realizes that the legs had to go through the openings. But maybe that's me.Puppy was hesitant at first, so we put some toys and a blanket inside. She peered around it, checking the quality of the construction no doubt, and ventured inside. Then she took the toys out and played with them. She has since gotten used to the house and enjoys playing in it. We tried to put it out in the garden or in the patio but she was very upset. She does not cope well with change -- but clearly she has declared this house her own. Now that I know how to assemble it, we can easily travel with it, though seeing it somewhere else might upset our crazy little puppy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BJNXCC5IRGTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5O60WM#wasThisHelpful","R1BJNXCC5IRGTE","A2UBSGFCP2QFNV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBSGFCP2QFNV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently started learning how to surf.  I originally went out in a sports bra - it was medium blue...it didn't occur to me that when wet it was a sheer medium blue.  So I went ahead & decided to try & find a bikini top.  The reason I originally went with a sports bra is because they're a tighter fit - they're designed to be that way...meaning it's a lot harder for the ocean to take your top off when you get hit by a wave (since when you're learning how to surf you will inevitably have quite a few wipe outs).  Ultimately - this has served its purpose.  I've worn it out I think 3-4x now & it's done pretty well.  The main reason I bought it was the price - it was $9 (for the one I bought at least).  So for $9 - I'm pretty happy.  But I'll admit - anything more & I wouldn't be giving it 4 stars.  There have been I think 3-4x when I had to readjust it after a wave took me out...but overall it's stood up surprisingly well.The fit seems right - I'm a 36B & the 8 fits me pretty well.  It is a lot smaller than I expected for some reason...but again - I was coming from a sports bra (which definitely provides more coverage than this).

"I love these skirts.  The fabric is super soft & flowy but best of all is the length...I'm pretty picky when it comes to long skirts - if they aren't touching the ground or within "" at most - it's not long enough. I'm 5'7"" & normally wear jeans that have at least a 33"" inseam (anything shorter is too short).  So finding a skirt that touches the ground can be a bit of a pain sometimes.  But these are awesome. I bought a ton of skirts from Amazon & had to return the vast majority of them - the ones that I didnt were either from this brand or Frumos.

"I'm actually returning these jeans - they're a bit too flared for me (like serious major flare going on here).  But the description provided is accurate, so that's my own fault.  What I will say though is the material is **amazing** - they're like jeans that you've owned for decades & are beyond broken in & comfortable...but they're brand new.  I'm the type who changes into my pajamas the minute I get home - I can't stand not being comfortable or being in restrictive pants...and I think I could easily sleep in these.

"These are awesome board shorts.  I have never surfed...but as of today I can at least say I have tried.  I went out today with a friend who attempted to teach me how to surf.  We went out last week with body boards & I quickly learned that swim bottoms vs very rough waters - the water wins...so I searched for a pair of board shorts that would actually stay on before we went back out again.  There's a hurricane off shore right now - so honestly the conditions were far from ideal to learn this (which is why I did not in fact surf much...I crouched on the board once...but that's about it) - but I did fight the waves like mad & paddle a whole bunch - and these shorts were amazing for that.  I was super comfy the whole time & despite getting knocked off my feet quite a few times at no point did I feel like my shorts were about to get taken away too :)The sizing seems about right.  i'm 5'7"" 140lbs, the sz 8 works for me with a good bit of room to spare (if I drop anymore weight I have a feeling the sz 6 will be the better fit).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2HPFMSITURB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZG8PN4#wasThisHelpful","R1N2HPFMSITURB","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these tops.  Their super light & not tight at all - very airy & breathable.  I wear them to bike in (I bike 10+ miles a day).  I also love that the straps are so thin - I bike during the day & live in Florida meaning I'm pretty tan at this point (well my arms are at least).  So this helps keep the tan lines from getting any funkier.They seem to run a bit bigger than some other adidas tops - but I think that's b/c of the loose fit.

"I really like these skirts.  They're super long & the fabric is solid - not at all sheer or see through (it's pretty thick & super stretchy - it's almost like the athletic wear type fabric, the wicking quickdry stuff - but heavier).  The only thing that bugs me is that it's kinda narrow at the bottom, meaning I can't take a full stride (I have a pretty big stride though).  So if I'm in a hurry (& I'm rarely patient enough to shorten my stride when walking) I have to hike it up a bit in order to not trip or something.  But I can live with that.  It's definitely on the longer side -  it's 43"" before folding the waist, didn't measure it but I'm super picky about length when it comes to skirts (& the site where I bought it lists the length).  I'm ~5'7"" (140lbs) & the medium (8/10) fits me great - the length puts it so it just barely touches the ground (which is how I like my skirts).  I liked it enough that I bought it in both colors.Also - the sizing listing on amazon isn't entirely accurate.  This is actually sized by S/M/L (I bought mine from 6pm, which amazon technically owns since they own Zappos).  The 8/10 is the size Medium.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWEXKALFN4I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBLPYCE#wasThisHelpful","R2MWEXKALFN4I5","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a bunch of long skirts on amazon recently (a BUNCH...like 10).  Of those I only kept 3 due to the length - I like my skirts long, very long.  They either have to be touching the ground or less than ¼"" from it.  I'm ~5'7"" & I often find maxi skirts to not be long enough to meet this requirement. While I would love it if these were just ½"" longer - they are still long enough to do the trick.  For anyone wondering, the other brands I tried were Azules, 82 Days & Frumos; the only other brand that had a skirt I kept was the Frumos brand - the Azules were hands down the shortest (way too short - like a solid 6"" off the ground) & the 82 days were just barely too short.The sizing is definitely smaller than what I'm used to - but the information provided in the description is accurate.  I normally wear a Medium these days (140lbs, as already mentioned - ~5'7""), but I got the large - mainly due to the extra length (the sizing says the Large is 43"" long compared to 42.5"" for the medium) - and I'm glad I did.  The length is not only what I was hoping for but i have a strong feeling the Medium would've been a bit too tight on me.Overall I really like this skirt (got it in 2 styles, considering a 3rd) & would definitely recommend it.  I'm glad that this was one of the skirts I was able to keep since I really love the design","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25FLW1GKIQUZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE9BQP0#wasThisHelpful","R25FLW1GKIQUZM","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first I thought I had gotten really lucky & the small gap that was mentioned in other reviews had been fixed by the time I got my case.  It didn't seem to be a problem at all - certainly nothing noticeable when I put my phone into the case...sadly I was wrong.  The gap isn't so much as a gap - but it's caused by the cover over the home button.  Since the home button is now also a finger-print-reader otterbox had to come up with a new type of cover for that one area so the button can still read your fingerprint - meaning the material used for the main cover on the phone is different than what's used over just the home button...meaning there is a seam.  And that seam is the problem.  So the gap is only detectable towards to the bottom of the screen - and only when trying to type or something like that...specifically the space bar when typing seems to be a problem...damn near everything comes out as one massive runon.  Seeing asI've had otterbox cases for going on 4yrs now - they're amazing cases...and I'm totally bummed that I finally have to find a new brand since the protection these cases offer is far beyond anything I've ever found before.  But the beauty of their previous cases was that it never impeded with the use of the phone (once you got past the extra bulk it added to the phone of course - which was a small price to pay for making it toddler- & 15'-lloft-proof).  Much like one of the top reviews for this case I too thought the gap wasn't that big of a deal.

"These are being used to store a massive Nat Geo collection.  I can fit 4 years in each box (with the leather cases).  They end up weighing around 50lbs each. With the previous boxes file boxes I used I had to secure the bottom with duct tape as they simply weren't strong enough to hold all that.The assembly is also a lot quicker than the ones I've used in the past since the bottom is almost fully assembled (you just kinda pop it open & slide down one flap & the bottom is done - you then put down 4 more flaps for the sides).

"I actually bought this as a gift for my dad - we coincidentally ended up buying the same Hampton Forge set last year & since my set turned out to be total crap I knew his was just as bad - so I thought he coudl use this.  Well turns out he already got a new set...so instead of returning I kept it.  And I'm really glad he got a new set - becuase I love these knives!! Our old set was Chicago Cutlery - they lasted 8-10 years of some major abuse (like being left for days in standing water) before the handles finally started splitting.  Why on earth I didn't buy another set from them originally is beyond me - but I'm glad I corrected that mistake now.Aside from their awesome cutting quality I think my favorite part about this set is the size - all the other sets I've seen with this many knives has a knife block that's huge.  This block is just barely bigger than the block we had for our 13pc set.  With limited counter space that's a huge plus.The handles do seem just a bit shorter than what I'm used to (they're about 1/2"" shorter than our old set which had the standard black riveted handles).  But I was concerned they might feel a bit slippery - which they thankfully don't.The one thing missing is the kitchen shears - but I'm guessing that would add considerably to the block size (& we still have the pair from the old chicago set we got rid of a year ago).  I personally have no use for the stick thing (since I don't even know what it would be used for) - but I assume others do since they seem to come with all the kitchen sets.  My son likes to use them as swords - but we have since found him a much safer foam one...so this one will sit unused in our block until I figure out what it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGP0OAEMRILFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NISVK4G#wasThisHelpful","RGP0OAEMRILFX","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are technically not 1/8"" - they're extremely close - but they're not.  I wish the description would simply have the primary description of these be 3mm - because that's exactly what they are.  And 1/8"" actually equals 3.175mm (so almost 3.2mm).  Yes I realize how small of a difference that is - but when you're dealing with something this small to begin with - believe me, it's noticeable.I bought these b/c they were described as 1/8"" magnets.  I didn't know which of the measurements it gave were being rounded.  I have tons of these but somehow managed to need more.  These arrived & they seemed ever so slightly smaller than my other 1/8"" magnets.  So I managed to find some (in fact i found an unopened brand new tube of 50 that I misplaced, of course they show up now) - and they are indeed smaller than the other 1/8"" magnets I have.I also have a slide gauge ruler (used for measuring beads) - so I decided to measure these.  These measure at exactly 3mm. The other ones I have measure at exactly 1/8"".  So for anyone wondering - the measurement that's being rounded is the inches - these are exactly 3mm in diameter (for the ones described as 1/8"").","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MHU2PILY435/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K599S4K#wasThisHelpful","R13MHU2PILY435","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So close to being an awesome toy...all it would need to be great is just one more riser for stability.  The lack of that 3rd riser makes this thing a royal pain.

It does not work with the other risers (like the Brio stacking risers which are awesome)  - otherwise it would be just fine - those things stabilize any raised track.

"Great concept, but the vast majority of the boxes were just too small for me.  I imagine many would be able to make use of most of the boxes - but the super small ones I can't see as being useful to anyone (although I do give them credit for making use of literally every inch inside the main box).  Ultimately - the only boxes that I was able to use were the Large Long boxes - which are actually too big for my needs.  I was trying to store 8/0 & 6/0 seed beads - just under 1oz of different colors & styles (they're currently in 16x130mm test tubes, filled to the top).  The large boxes could not fit these, they overflowed & left quite a good bit that wouldn't fit - same with the Medium Long boxes.  The Large Long boxes are double the size of the large boxes - and that left a ton of space.  So obviously this wasn't working in terms of the box sizes for me.But the one thing I think would be a problem for everyone was lids - they were a bit tight to open & unless you're super careful I could see lots of beads spilling in the process of opening some of these boxes.  The large long boxes were the easiest to open - I imagine this is b/c of the long front where the lid hooks (the length gives that front panel a bit more flexibility allowing it to open a bit easier - the shorter front panel in the regular Large boxes makes that much more rigid).  The Medium Long boxes were probably the most spillable when it came to opening them - they're super shallow & while they have the long front the shallowness still means they're tricky to open - and since they're so shallow the contents can easily be spilled all over the place.And ultimately, replacing the boxes is not too cheap - the cheapest I've found the replacements (or refills as they call them) is JoAnns when they're having a sale - you can get a set of 2 Large Long boxes for as little as $1.50 then (otherwise they're $3 a set) - but the only size JoAnns has is the LL box.  The amazon price for these refills currently starts at $4.44 for a 2pk of the LL - that's the lowest price; the ML - $5.84/4pk, Large - $6.19/4pk; XL - $5.13/each.

"I have a thing for clocks & this is my 3rd clock from Infinity Instruments, so I had faith I would like this clock, but I honestly wasn't expecting to absolutely love this clock...it's awesome!! First - let me say that my other 2 clocks from Infinity are going on 5yrs old & have been through some major abuse during some moves - but they're both still perfectly on time & absolutely silent - so I know this brand makes some quality products.I initially bought this to put in my sons room - he just turned 3 & we wanted a clock to use to start teaching him time - it had to have a second hand & minute markings & had to be silent (since all clocks in my house must be silent or they will be destroyed).  The fact that it was red was a bonus as that's his favorite color.  But what I didn't think of was how solid this clock would be - the case is made of steel & it's 3"" deep (all of this info is in the listing - I just didn't really think about that).  We're hoping to hang this around eye level for him meaning he will be able to get it off the wall if given the chance to & this clock is so solid that if he were to get to it & then drop it or test it's flying capabilities (which is always possible with a toddler, although accidentally dropping it is much more likely) he could do some damage.  So I think I'll be looking for a much crappier clock for his room...but I'm thrilled I made the mistake as this means I can now keep this clock for myself.It's a smaller clock - 8.5"" (most wall clocks start around 9-9.5"" & while that may not seem like a huge difference when it comes to diameter it actually is).  And it does sit quite a ways off the wall - the picture really doesn't give you a good idea of the depth of this clock - but it's deep.  It's perfect for a smaller room or a bathroom - which is where I plan to hang it.  I hope I can find another clock for my son.  We have a ton of clocks including some from other brands like Bai & Decomates - but the Infinity clocks are the only ones that have lasted so long while remaining absolutely silent (in fact my Bai clock started ticking after just a few months; the Decomates one still runs great - but it's starting to develop a slight tick).  I think I'll be looking for a desktop clock for my son instead - something that's designed to be picked up if need be (& something that won't put a dent in our hardwoods if dropped - or hurt the daylights out of his toes).

"I bought this b/c the photo shows real chips (like the solid, nice ones that have some weight to them - not the super cheap thin plastic chips).  Unfortunately this does not work with those too well.  The chips do fit in all the slots - but about 1/3rd are too narrow for the chips to slide - I have to wedge them in (& 1 I have to essentially force them in..so I'm not using that slot too much).  It's a great design - love the idea - it's like a compact carousel (without the carousel bit...), but the execution was just barely off.  This works just fine with the plastic cheap chips (I have an old set of those I tested out & those all fit no problem at all) - but the nicer chips just don't all fit in there.As for the rest of it - the plastic is very solid & the card slots are just fine.  The price is also fantastic.  The shipping was decent enough.  If the slots were just the tiniest bit wider I'd be giving this 5 stars...but unfortunately that tiny bit makes this a bit of a pain to use.

The one thing I will say though - it's definitely not non-skid (at least not on our floors) - it's not as bad as the slick rug backing - i doubt you'll end up ice skating like you can with rugs on hardwoods sometimes - but it will definitely move around a bit on some hardwoods.  I had a feeling that would be the case & also bought one of the rubbery non-skid things - so we have 3 layers now - the rubbery non skid pad, then this thick piece of felt, then our carpet.  I will say that it's not the most aesthetic thing (it's literally the exact same size our rug - so it's hard not to notice it when looking at the floor) - but the comfort it provides is worth it (& it's not like it's sticking out the sides).  I haven't tried cutting it - but I don't think it would be too hard to do if needed - provided you had some quality sheers to work with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4XFQNOYSWRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4HMUH8#wasThisHelpful","R2O4XFQNOYSWRT","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great toys - my son is obsessed with them (all the planes from either of the planes movies - and basically any other small diecast airplane).  The quality on most of these is decent enough - this specific model included (we had problems with one of the props for Bulldog - it keeps sticking & won't spin...but at least my son makes the most of it with a dramatic fiery crash into the playroom floor).  However I will say unlike some of the Disney Cars toys which are generally much more solid than the hot wheels or matchbox cars - these tend to be on the same level as the Matchbox & Hotwheels planes we have - in fact the hot wheels ones are actually better for the most part (but smaller).  What really deserves the 5 stars is the price - at least right now - it's priced at just $2.19 as an add on & there are a few other planes characters also under $3!  I thought there must me a mistake with this - but apparently not!  maybe it's b/c of the holidays - I don't know - but I haven't seen them priced anything below $3.50 elsewhere (we thought they were a steal at a department store for $3.99!).  We already own almost all of them at this point - but I couldn't resist taking advantage of the low prices - so I bought a bunch more & am taking them to the womens shelter as holiday presents for the kids there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50NIUF6PQWNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8BNVP4#wasThisHelpful","R50NIUF6PQWNC","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping these would work for my seed bead collection - but unfortunately they're far too small.  The lids don't help this as they're inserted into the tube (meaning you can't fill these to the rim - you have to leave some solid space at the top for the lid).  They're good quality tubes - and if you're looking to use these with 10/0 or 11/0 beads they might work - I'd say they can probably hold about 2 strands of 11/0 or 10/0 beads (maybe more) - but they're definitely not for larger collections or people trying to store larger amounts for use.I've tried a bunch of alternatives, but the one I've found to work best so far is coin tubes.  Not only are they super cheap (you can get them as low as $0.25/tube depending on the size & where you're looking) - but they're available in a variety of sizes & have screw-on lids.  The closest size compatible to this would be for dimes - but the size I've found to work best for 6/0 beads is definitely the penny or the nickel sizes.  The penny tube can hold about 1oz of 6/0 beads perfectly.  The only problem I'm having with these is finding some way to then store the tubes (like a test tube rack or something)...but I'm sure i'll work something out.  I'm also trying out some actual test tubes today (since those too are also very cheap & they have racks!).Overall - while these are quality tubes they're just too small for me.  I would've given them 5-stars regardless of this (since the dimensions are in the description - not their fault they're not big enough for me) - but the inset caps are a no-go for something marketed for bead storage use in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KOB7OPI30SNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EM9WM0#wasThisHelpful","R1KOB7OPI30SNI","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just used this for the first time to make banana bread mini loaves (more like banana bread brownie-sized loaves).  It worked beautifully - my banana bread turned out great - and the best part was the removal..l let it cool & I was able to literally lift them straight out...I was shocked (I thought I'd at least have to peel away the mold, but no!).However I do have one complaint, it's too flimsy - I thankfully suspected it would be beforehand & filled it with a mesh grate underneath it.  I tried lifting it & the middle row just bowed in - so I just put it in the oven along with the grate (which is actually what we use for cooking pizza).  I have another silicone mold used for candy or ice cubes (so it's very very small, about 6x8 I'd say) - it's of little lego figures - and in between the molds on the bottom side there are bars connecting each mold (so when looking at this mold in the photos shown there would be bars in between each cup) - I didn't get why they were there till I filled it up with juice to make some mini juice pops for my son - the mold stayed perfectly flat as I put it in the freezer.

"I wear a size 10.5-11 in most shoes so I didn't know if these were fit.  I'm happy to say the size 11s fit just fine.  However they arrived with the material peeling away from the sole of the shoe on the outside of the boot.  Yes these are $30 boots - and if this started to happen after at least one wear I'd probably give them 4 stars - since I'm not expecting them to be the best boots out there.  But to arrive like that is definitely not something that should happen with any shoes (unless they're used).I imagine the packaging might be involved with this - these were in a shoebox, but the shoebox was mailed in just a poly mailer, not an actual shipping box.  I thought this was strange since almost everything I buy from Amazon comes in a box (heck - I've received an amazon shipping box inside of another amazon shipping box before!) - just today I had some fingerless gloves arrive in a poly mailer - that were inside a shipping box.  So as you can imagine the shoebox endured some major abuse before it even got to me - the lid was essentially a flat piece of cardboard on top of a mangled shoebox - not much protection there.Ultimatley I did end up keeping them - I'm not a shoe person or a fashion person & honestly I doubt i'll wear these much - certainly not enough to justify spending any more time on trying to find a different pair...but just know that this is not one of those products that will make you think you got some amazing deal...you will get what you pay for...","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBPAH490YOFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2C5BEC#wasThisHelpful","R1WBPAH490YOFP","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are decent buttons.  The one main issue I had with the bag I received was the spread of colors.  I ended up with about 15 pink buttons & no more than 3 blue ones.  However I realize that this is a random mix - meaning it literally is random.The buttons each have a diameter of 2cm (just over 0.75"").  The sizing is consistent however it looks like a few ended up getting bowed (kinda like a bowl) - but just a few.I really do want to have an issue with the price - it's hard to feel like 40  colored buttons is worth $5.50 - but while these aren't super high quality they also aren't bottom of the barrel - the holes are all consistently placed & the colors are solidly opaque - there is no issue with the paint consistency (which I'm very happy about).  And I looked quite a bit online to find a better price to no avail.  The only better price I found was if I ordered direct from China (which will take about 3-4 weeks - in which case I could find them as low was $4-5/100pk) - but if you don't have that time & don't need 100+ then that's really not very useful!I'll be using these in some crafts down the road but right now my almost 3yo son is having a blast with them.  I didn't realize he'd like them so much - he was getting fussy at the dinner table waiting for food & these were in reach so I chucked some onto a small tray & let him play with them - he's insisted on playing with them each night since!!  He already knows all of his colors but now we're onto things like patterns - so these are getting put to use with that (& thankfully he's fine with all the patterns having pink).  My son does not put things in his mouth (I still don't leave him out of sight with these, but I have no concern that he might try to eat them) - But please note - these are NOT suitable for kids who might put them in their mouth - they are definitely a choking hazard.  If you're looking for something suitable for that I suggest  REALLY BIG BUTTONS 60/PKG. - I got these when he was around 14mths & they were big enough for him to safely play with then (with supervision of course).

I have WAY too many string lights from more brands than I care to count (I have a strange thing with lighting & frosted/diffused lighting is my favorite) and I have never seen lights this terrible!The blue & green ones are the worst.  The blue ones have tons of splotchy spots on them.  The green ones - the coloring for some reason highlights the seam in the middle of the plastic (where the two halves were joined) - it's clear that the  The only color that's kinda pearly are the red ones.It's clear that these use some sort of liquid coloring which has caused the unevenness and is why the seams are highlighted (since the liquid clung to those abnormalities in the plastic).  I have no idea what process is normally used to color the plastic for bubble string lights (have yet to see the How It's Made on those), but if I had to guess I would assume they're made of pre-colored plastic since that's probably easiest to get the semi-opaque finish & along with even color.  It's obvious that whatever the right process is - it's not what was used on these.  As cute as they are when they're turned off - they're useless once you actually try to use them....so they're going back.I did my best to show the problems these have in some photos, but you can only really see these issues once they're on (or being held up to light) - and it's always hard to get good photos of lit objects, so the photos really understate how terrible these are.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1880WRR56KCLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054G5Z6O#wasThisHelpful","R1880WRR56KCLB","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great cushions.  I will admit - they're a bit on the thick side which makes them look just a bit odd on the chairs we're currently using them on - but after using one for about 2 days now it's not nearly as overly fluffy as it was when they arrived (but still comfy).  And honestly, I've always been one to prefer comfort over style - and these definitely provide a lot more comfort than the wooden slats I was sitting on.  The dimensions are correct as listed in the description (18.5""W x 15.5"") & they fit our chairs well with regards to that (the chairs we're using them on right now are pretty much identical to these chairs:  Amazonia Teak London 2-Piece Teak Folding Chair - except the back slats go all the way down).I doubt they could handle true outdoor exposure - like being left in the rain or anything - but almost no cushions can (at least none that I've heard of - my dad has a set of crazy expensive cushions & he has to keep them in a storage bench when not in use).  These are being used on our screened-in patio so I'm not too concerned with that.  They seem like they'll handle humidity as well as most cushion, but I live in Florida, so it won't be long until I know for sure (our humidity levels average at least 85% each night...this morning it was 99% when I woke up - and the sun had already come up!) - and if anything arises I'll update this accordingly.If your looking for low budget cushions I would definitely recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJ2AW5P1P0WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I39ZRV2#wasThisHelpful","R1JJ2AW5P1P0WQ","A3JT3H3CEXCYYT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JT3H3CEXCYYT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered these in size 62mm in both Gunmetal/Dark green lenses and Gunmetal/Tortoise/Gradient brown lenses to choose the one that looks best. (Thanks Amazon for an amazing and free return policy!)First of all, these sunglasses are very stylish and in my opinion they look better than the standard RB3025 aviator. Also, size 62mm is perfect for people with large faces like me.At first I liked the brown color better because it goes well with my skin color, looks more natural and not as harsh as the green lenses which are almost black. Also, on this particular model the gradient brown lenses are dark which is good. (note that I purchased the gunmetal frame. Another reviewer mentioned that the brown lenses with the arista gold color wasn't dark enough)However, when I tried both of them this morning under a sunny 85 degree NYC sky, I noticed that the brown lenses are kinda reddish when exposed to the sun and I found it to be a little weird. The the dark green lenses, on the other hand, kept their original color and offered a little more so I opted to keep the dark green and return the brown one even though brown/tortoise seem to be my favorite sunglasses color.I hope it helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPZ1L2XSHVYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5MJPS6#wasThisHelpful","R3UPZ1L2XSHVYY","A1H02B9CTO1KM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H02B9CTO1KM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As other reviewers have stated, while listening to songs on my iPhone it skips songs on its own, brings up Siri and voice control, changes the song speed and does some other weird stuff.

I'm assuming that the microphone malfunctions and being that at least 6 other reviewers have reported the same problem I don't think I have a defective unit.I'm returning (thanks to Amazon's excellent and unbeatable return policy) and I'll get a regular headphone without Mic.

"This is a very good product, holds a lot of charge and I'm giving 4 stars because it has a few minor, very minor annoyances.Pros- Small. (The diameter is about the same of a nickel and the length is about 2 AA batteries stacked on top of each other. See my images)- Comes with a nice little bag that can hold the battery as well as a cable. (Note that it comes with a USB > Micro USB cable to charge the battery but you need to use your USB > X cable where X is the type of connector your phone or electronic device uses.- Different colors. If you have a silver iPhone for example, you can get the silver battery. Same thing with the gold phone.- Holds a decent amount of juice for its size. I had my iPhone 6 with 0 battery. I was able to charge it from 0 to 100% and the battery still had juice. I'll do more testing and update my review.Cons- The button to turn it on is hard to press, especially if you have your USB cable connected. It has its advantage because if you put it in a bag it won't accidentally turn on.. But it could be a little easier to press. So basically you need to turn the battery on and then plug the cable.- There is no indicator of how much juice you have left. The competitor (Jackery Mini Premium) has 4 lights to show the amount of battery left, but on the other hand it's square so it's harder to carry in your pocket and that's the reason I got the Anker®.- It's a little heavier than you would expect. Maybe because it's small. But this is not a major issue.See my images for more details:","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NK3HDFO6WYTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NF5NTK#wasThisHelpful","R2NK3HDFO6WYTS","A1H02B9CTO1KM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H02B9CTO1KM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading several reviews here, I decided to add this one to my extensive 60's Spy Film collection. I love David Niven, so how could I go wrong?O, let me count the ways, brethren, 'cause this one's a drag from start to finish.First, you expect me to believe that British Intelligence didn't have enough agents to go around (at the height of the Cold War?), so they had to recruit a surgeon (Niven) named Dr. Love. How? By promising to appease his car fetish + provide him with some extravagant vehicle which, by the way, never materializes.Secondly, there is no real villain in this film, so it gets rightfully dinged for that disgrace. How can you have a Cold War spy film w/o a tangible villain wringing sweaty palms while plotting a world takeover?Thirdly, and let me remind you we're talking about a spy flick here, there is only ONE woman in the film, and she's nothing to look at (and I don't care who's sister she was or that she died in a car accident shortly after this film; which would have been a better plot than what we're succumbing to here). Again, ONE woman - no leggy, mini-skirted, scantily clad vixens or dollies to ease the pain or divert one's attention to prurient fantasies like all other spy flicks. Harsh? Sure, but it's my review - be as kind + forgiving as you want when you write your own...Weapons? The obligatory spy pen, cyanide pill, a silly ring and a watch used to identify agents, given to by an uncle - had the Brits never seen Man From U.N.C.L.E??? One cheesy cheap cliché after another.Locales? The ass-end of Beirut, full of squalor and no evil henchmen residing.  Not even a high-end hotel, no exotic scenery, major landmarks, nada. Yeesch. And apparently, British Intelligence was completely inept as far as field agents go, which makes me wonder how we won the Cold War, 'cause this common, middle-aged Dr. Love (sounds like a 70's exploitation character) manages to violently kill a slew of people (isn't that a violation of the Hippocratic Oath?), out-maneuver the Reds and save the world in what other reviewers have stated as 'realistic' for a spy flick... huh?It's about 20 minutes too long, seeing as we know how this is going to play out about 30 minutes in. My tolerance for the tedious when it comes to 60's cinema is remarkably high, but this clunker was a drag throughout. I should have seen it coming when I saw how many times Val Guest's name was splashed during the opening credits - he's a hack along the lines of Harry Novak, only less subtle (lol).The only two things this film has in its favor are David Niven and a great soundtrack featuring B-3 organ legend Jimmy Smith and some frantic percussion to simulate action sequences that really aren't there..In conclusion, I'm sure I've ticked off a boatload of folks, but I've sunk many a ship before this. I'm just trying to warn other like-minded fools not to fall for all the hype I did when I plopped down coin for this cinematic swill.'Where the Spies Aren't' would've been a more appropriate title.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7Q79E04GMTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEYPVSE#wasThisHelpful","R1C7Q79E04GMTN","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After looking forward to receiving this all year (Dynamite's notorious for pushing release dates back, just like Sideshow), I am sorry to say it's incredibly disappointing on all levels.It's cast from an extremely lightweight porcelain(?) and weighs less than 2 pounds, which means it's porous + waiting to fall apart.The cape is attached to her hands at a very weak wrist - another accident awaiting.Her arms are joined below her armbands, and poorly at that.

But I can't stress this enough - it's cheaply made for the 2 bills you're shelling out for her.Then there are the paint issues - sloppy lines on Vampi's boots, costume, bracelets, etc., and her face needed a few more details as well. And the base is hastily and weakly executed w/ all the customary clichés that sit flat and lack depth or detail. And she's only around 9 1/2 inches tall - 12 inches includes the base. So, not 1/6th scale.Finally, after telling us that the statue was to be strictly limited to 1969 pieces (the year she first graced our eyes), the box plainly states that there are diamond eye versions, B+W versions AND artist proofs, bringing the corrected total up to 2317 pieces in all. So much for honesty from these rats.I own around 28 Vampirella statues; some I made + painted myself, some bought from other artists + collectors, but this one I ended up returning - it wasn't adding to my collection one iota.And I'm usually a completest, but this one lacks 'bite'...Sorry, very sorry in fact, to be bearer of bad news, but you should lower your expectations accordingly if planning on parting w/ your hard-earned coin.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WU5R143JHN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145QVQL6#wasThisHelpful","R31WU5R143JHN5","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CONAN RED SONJA - 2015 -Gail Simone has once again woven a fine tale that rings true to both of these iconic characters in this outing, and with admirable results to fans of both characters, unlike most crossovers I read.In addition, Danial Panosian and Randy Green have moved away from Sonja as we're used to seeing her in her ongoing Dynamite series and returned her to a more modernized version of the Roy Thomas originals from Marvel back in the 70's. AND it works wonderfully without appearing dated at all.Great tale, smoking art and coloring coupled with time-honored characters make this one to add to your collection, and would make Robert E. Howard proud.On top of all that, this HC book is extremely well made - strong cover boards, tightly woven binding and very thick page stock insures that this one won't be falling apart anytime soon.

"""Man did not start the war between Good and Evil. But he WAS the cause..."" And so begins another saga revolving around the Watchers, the Fallen, Nephilim, True-Bloods, Half-Breeds and, of course, we humans. I know what you're thinking: great, ANOTHER story regarding Judeo-Christian beliefs about battles between angels, demons et. al. - WRONG. Well, yes, true enough, but this one sits very far apart from any I've read before. It's darker, more vicious, blatantly unholy, disturbing, profane and plays out like a Grindhouse double-bill crossover mash-up of Sin City meets Supernatural.The story starts like you might imagine, but 20 pages in and it starts to ramp up into overdrive; the dialogue is filthy and perverse, the characters are fleshed out or stripped to bone, the intensity quotient burns the meter levels to ash and we're on our way to graphic novel Heaven by way of Hell. No more clichés - we're treated to real characters, horrid evil, sexual deviants, political miscreants and plot devices not in average tales like this. Kudos.Now the even better part - as good as the tale is concerned, the artwork by Simon Bisley (Eisner Award-winning illustrator + artist of 'Batman/Judge Dredd' and 'Lobo', to name a few) is ferocious, feral and fear-invoking. Hyper-real, hyper-violent, hyper-sonic sickness that wouldn't let me put it down until I finished it (much to my wife's chagrin, much to my grin). Immortal sin never felt or looked so good! You NEED this in your collection, so I'm gonna stop writing now so you can hit the 'Buy It Now' button and feel the blistering burn of Brimstone, uber-babes, creepy demons and historical references to our unholy Biblical past.Man, are WE effed-up!5 scorching stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7RZYKCIIGPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178276061X#wasThisHelpful","RE7RZYKCIIGPS","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I gleefully ordered this cd from Amazon, and no detailed info was provided, then someone wrote a wretched review of it a few days later, declaring it unlistenable... there goes my coin on another frivolous whim, I thought. Certainly not the 1st time, probably not the last.However, I'm elated to report that when I did get around to listening to the unlistenable, I was more than impressed. Not solely because I had my expectations lowered to the dregs; no sir, this is one helluva performance by what was arguably the greatest jazz quartet that ever existed. Sure, it's a compromised recording by today's standards (even quality old recordings), and I guess what you listen to it on plays a big role in what you're able to hear, but I've got an old-skool stereo power amp receiver w/ some gigundo speakers, and I had no difficulty hearing ANY of the players, either as a collective OR as soloists, so I was in heaven hearing something I didn't already have in my extensive collection of Miles + Co.The first track, 'Gingerbread Boy', is a bit rough sonically, but Miles plays his ass off on this like I've never heard before. He's on fire, proving to anyone who had doubt that he was still an unstoppable force of nature, both as composer and trumpet sovereign.  Tony drove this band at breakneck pace, but here, Miles is one step ahead of his legendary timekeeper and takes a blistering, vicious solo that floored me. They bob, weave and joust about like sparring partners, so any sonic suffering I have to contend with is ignored by the admiration I have for this band. Next up is the final time this quartet ever performed 'Stella By Starlight' live (according to the liner notes), followed by the only time these giants played 'Dolores' live (ditto). It's powerful and every member takes the tune to greater heights than the vinyl recording (am I dating myself calling it 'vinyl'? Can't say I care...). By the 3rd track, the audio quality has improved considerably.Wayne takes his spot on several tracks, like 'Round Midnight' and 'So What', laying lush comments and piercingly thoughtful remarks as only Wayne can; Herbie actually has space to play by himself during 'Walkin' w/o Tony prodding him and  abstracting rhythmic meters to contradict melodies Herbie is entrenched in. Although Tony does more than his share of subdividing meters, fracturing time, pushing parameters and restlessly shifting rhythmic undercurrents randomly to keep his band mates offguard and instinctually attentive throughout the show. After all, this IS Tony we're talking about. And he never disappoints...One thing about the liner credits I take issue with is that Ron Carter is not listed on bass, but rather Albert Stinson - I've listened to far too many recordings by these guys to know that NO pick-up player could possibly play at this frenzy w/o dropping notes and ultimately embarrass himself (though Stinson is undoubtedly a great player) - this IS Ron Carter for sure; just listen to his playing, it's unmistakable, IMO. There would be a huge vacancy if it was anyone else, and this music is as dense as the Amazon jungle was 100 years ago.This is a historic document of great importance to practitioners of Miles' voodoo and the legendary Quartet that deserves capitalization when referred to, so casual listeners should take note. Pick up the Berlin, Japan or Philharmonic live recordings that have been painstakingly remastered instead. But if you're a voracious fan or collector like me, it really doesn't get much sweeter than this. After all these years, how many more unheard of gems can we possibly hope for? Besides, it would only be a few months until this group dissolved, and we have almost nothing to caress as live documents from this period.The cd comes with a booklet w/ a Melody Maker interview Miles did in 1968 that's hysterical as he trashes his trumpet peers, along w/ some great, rarely seen photos of Miles. Staunch supporters of this man and his bandmates will enjoy this in spite of and because of its aural weaknesses. Who lives in an ideal world?

But I am a huge fan of certain reinventions + reimaginings, like the Bride of Frankenstein, rewritten here. So I gave it a shot + was more than compensated for my suspended beliefs, and heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Frankenstein mythos, X-Files and visceral balls-to-the-wall carnage + hyper-violence.Add a bit of Nazi backstory, severely dysfunctional family dynamics, a dash of Sapphic subplot, a dollop of conspiratorial cover-ups, then heavily pepper the dialogue with cutting edge cursing, wicked sarcasm + cultural references, and you've got yourself one helluva story w/ great artwork that can't be put down.

"A lot has already been said about these on Amazon, so I won't rehash too much, but I have a few points to add. While I love these for what they are - light, almost brushlike but w/ more sound and oomph, an interesting, shimmering  sound on hi-hats + rides, great for not wanting to sound too loud, etc - It's what they're not that irks me.They sound completely dead + have no bounceback on toms, the bamboo isn't top shelf, so that they breakdown, splinter, fray on rims very easily, but the major annoyance is that the rods come out of the PVC almost immediately + constantly have to be pushed back in - a thin strip of gaffers tape where the 2 PVC pieces are helps tremendously, but doesn't eradicate the problem entirely. Because then the inner rods start to come forward and they too have to be pushed back in place. It's a design flaw that you don't need a scientist to solve, just better proactive design. Anyone heard of glue? A dollop at the bottom would work wonders...And if you dig in w/ them at all, the foam core comes out, so these multiple issues make them  great but frustrating at the same time.I play match grip, so I'm hitting the rims more than a traditional grip player would, so the quick deterioration of the bamboo may have something to do w/ that. Maybe not. The Hotrods I've used last considerably longer, but I'm not a huge fan of them either for my own reasons.So as long as you're prepared to deal w/ these issues + plan on keeping several pairs around due to their limited lifespan, these are a sweet alternative to sticks or brushes 'cause they sorta straddle the line between both - it's the best + worst of both worlds.But, as in any relationship, it's the give + take that counts, right?(If you're looking for something a bit beefier that sounds more like sticks but still not too loud and very controllable, and something that takes a beating - pun intended - and lasts longer + thus far hasn't come apart like the Tala Wand - and again, I'm a fan, sorta - try the Vic Firth Rute. It's more steroidal in thickness, sound attack and construction, sounds much better on toms and I've beat them like red-headed stepchildren w/o any issues - yet).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLLPVB99104D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GFWS7W#wasThisHelpful","R1GLLPVB99104D","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been voraciously inhaling the Creepy + Eerie Archives masterfully compiled by Dark Horse, and it's come time to house them in their own bookcase as showpieces in my library. What better way to draw attention to our gory, goulish guardians of said library than to perch these two fiendish friends atop the bookcase? I got the Uncle Creepy last year(very impressive), but for some strange reason thought Ol'Cuz Eerie wasn't going to be all that, and brother was I wrong. I just got him last week, and he's  as impressive, maybe more so, than our uncomely Uncle.First, he's incredibly heavy (solid resin), of enormous stature, same height as Unca Creepy,but his rotund proportions make him look much bigger. (As you fans know, he's always depicted as much smaller in the mags when saddled up to his ugly Unc). He's massively brutish and heebie-jeebie ridden. In a cage fight, my coin's on our Cuz...Secondly, but most importantly, the sculpts executed by Tony Cipriano are amazing on both characters, much better than they've ever been portrayed in print. Facial details are fiendish, costumes are detailed brilliantly, great color choices and bases are perfect. Well-executed paintjobs too, considering they're probably done in 3rd world countries by child labor...but I digress, this review is about our beloved bastions of the macabre, and master T.Cip's hit another home run horror collectible here - how does he DO it? Each statue is limited to 500 hand-numbered pieces and comes in an (un)handsomely collectible box.Long story short (well, for me), you NEED these in your loathesome library and shocker statues.

"As a longtime reader and admirer (for obvious reasons) of Howard's Red Sonja and sword and sorcery in general, I usually pick up all the Dynamite collections of her exploits. Especially when Lucio Parrillo is doing her covers, as I consider him to be the finest artist/painter working in this genre today. One look at the cover and I was in.This edition collects the stand-alone four-issue story arc offspring of the Red Sonja series, and the story is good, though nothing we as fans haven't read before. But, as fans, if you're fond of this character, it's an enjoyable read. As good as some tales, but not as good as most collections, IMO. But my real problem was the vibrant neon colors and just OK artwork, which left me wanting something darker to saddle up properly with the storyline. This cheapened the entire effort for me. You look at Parrillo's artwork and go ""Whoa"", then view the story art and go ""Eh..."" Max Dunbar's pencilwork just didn't do it for me - but you may feel differently.Long story short, 'Atlantis Rises', though your personal excitement level may not. 3 1/2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97MS6HSLYLHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606903942#wasThisHelpful","R97MS6HSLYLHM","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having grown up with this album and being especially influenced by these artists as a young musician, I was both eager and skeptical of this release, but decided to pull the trigger and hope that ammo wasn't wasted. It far exceeded my expectations by a longshot, and all true aficionados of music should be required to own this DVD. Not just watch it, but give it repeated listenings - it's the best music DVD I've seen since 'Jeff Beck - Live at Ronnie Scotts' from a few years ago. Yup, it's that good.Both McLaughlin and Carlos are in top form, and instead of each playing a set with their own bands and unifying for an overbloated finale (like a lot of these concert pairings), both bands are blended (I'll refrain from using the word 'Fused') throughout the concert without the potentially disasterous clashing of musical egos and artistic overarching from guys of this caliber. Roles are established and egos kept checked until your space was allotted, at which point you could break loose and raise hell, which happened frequently.What also thrilled me was the selection of tracks - in addition to the classic 'Love, Devotion, Surrender' tracks and reprise, we're treated to compositions by John Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Miles, Led Zep, Pharoah Sanders, Wayne Shorter, Sonny Sharrock and Tony Williams Lifetime, which was the highpoint for me. Here, Cindy Blackman channeled Tony like no one else could (she was his student) and gave McLaughlin the kick in the ass he needed to resurrect some of the blistering, visceral psych-acid-jazzrock fretwork we don't always hear from him anymore. Two astonishing tracks worth the price alone. And don't get me started on Cindy's drum solo, another tribute to her mentor Tony Williams, who Santana calls ""probably the greatest drummer who ever lived"" - this said in front of his newlywed wife, the best female drummer on the planet (at least the one I live on)! I felt sorry for Dennis Chambers, another monsterous skinbasher, who was relegated to Cindy's shadow most of the night.I could go on, but 'There Comes A Time' when you no longer need to convert the musical mind - if you love great guitarists, virtuoso musicians, near-flawless vocabulary and execution, perfect pacing and performances by egoless giants, and just want to sit mesmerized with the cat-who-just-ate-the-canary look on your face, you need this, as in yesterday. This is your 'Invitation'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWIHK64W9C59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPH7V98#wasThisHelpful","R3MWIHK64W9C59","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Red Sonja, Volume VI: Death - Dynamite Entertainment} This compelling collection contains issues #30-34 of the ongoing series. Red Sonja sacrificed her life to rid the world of the villainy of age-old demon Kulan Gath and now finds herself travelling with a mysterious Ferryman along the River Styx. When asked by Sonja where their final destination is, the Boatman replies, ""To the river's end, where you will be judged"". Her reply is curt; ""I will be judged by no one - any who died by my hand richly deserved their fate"". Not entirely true, as we come to learn, as there was much collateral damage caused by her actions in life, and she now has to confront such events and reflect on her responsibilities as a warrior whose single-mindedness left many fatalities in her wake. Epic battles and past pivotal moments are relived for our entertainment and excitement, whether it be for the incendiary incidents depicted or for the scantily clad she-demon we pine and pant for. 'Doesn't matter either way, our money and time here is as well-spent as her adversaries.The ending has its share of thrilling twists and circular storyboarding (""Same as it ever was, same as it ever was"") that's supremely satisfying to aficionados of the series, so don't let this collection slip downstream - you'll be sorry you did when judgment comes round. Even in a savage, eerie underworld, it takes a strong sword arm to survive...The cover is by Alex Ross, the cover gallery includes luminaries like Fabiano Neves (who even illustrates an entire story - rare that is!) and Paul Reynaud (both also do transfixing Vampirella covers regularly), Adriano Batista and Ken Kelly. Impressive lot of talent, and remarkable writers include Ron Marz, Lee Moder, Pablo Marcos, Luke Lieberman and Brian Reed - 'can't go wrong with this one, gents...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8OCNO99U74P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933305908#wasThisHelpful","RB8OCNO99U74P","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All lovers of Conan, Sinbad, Kull, Jason and the Argonauts, Ulysses, Hercules, Tarzan, hell, even Vampirella will find much to enjoy here. The eight issue saga begins and ends within this volume, which is true of most of the Red Sonja collections, unlike other character volumes, where there's still no conclusion after 2 or 3 collections, which always leaves me (and you) hanging for closure. Sure, this tale requires some backstory, but it's adequately provided in either dialogue or flashback, so we can all stay up to speed and enjoy the journey forward.

"I don't really understand folks who claim to love Eurohorror, but won't watch films that are subtitled. Anyone with an 8th grade education can read subs, and seeing these classics dubbed by people who do cartoonish voiceovers is nothing more than insulting - to the viewer, to the director, to the actors involved, to the viewing experience. The entire film's focal point is diverted to the gutter and suffers as a whole. Many casual viewers will disagree, but devotees understand my point completely. The English-dubbed version is wretched to listen to - you will not hear ANY of the actual actors real voices, and the flick suffers as much as the viewer does who wastes his/her time screening it. How do I know this? I've seen it in BOTH languages, and it's like two completely different movies...First off, these are Bava films, so you either love his late-60's work or hate it, period. The same things that we fans of his later 60's output love are usually the very same things that turn others off. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time reviewing the actual movie itself, but rather what's on display in them - the luscious Euro babes with big, teased hair and false eyelashes, the accompanying mini-skirts, go-go boots and chain belts, the futuristic furniture, accessories and decor (the same stuff that's resurgently popular today), the elaborate architecture and European landscapes, the cool cars, the extravagant, permissive lifestyles and hedonistic parties and, of course, Edwige Fenech.I realize that these things have nothing to do with whether these are good movies or not, but I also know I'm not alone in my rabid fascination for all things from this particular time period, and that WILL have an impact on whether you enjoy these films. Derivitive plot? Sure. Annoying soundtrack? Yup. Predictable outcome? Absolutely. It's akin to Agatha Christie on acid. So if the plot steers off course here and there while enjoying the visual feast on display as described above, who cares? Besides, Bava displays a black sense of humor here that's not present in most of his work outside of his few comedies.I'm giving it 4 stars because, although flawed, I don't want folks to think it's a cinematic clunker - it's of of Bava's minor gems that's not often seen or available in the states, but definitely worth your time + attention if you enjoy seeing the master having some fun while delivering the gothic goods with a late 60's psych feel, unbelievable architecture, and a cast that includes the luscious Edwige Fenech in one of her first truly sexy and memorable roles. It's a relentless mod murder mystery and pristine parade of eye-candy and loungy, kitschy atmosphere, peppered with sultry sex and murder as only Bava can pull off effectively. But do yourself a favor and watch it in Italian w/ subs to see, taste, feel and enjoy it as it was meant to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16B3T8SR1L2JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI67N94#wasThisHelpful","R16B3T8SR1L2JL","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[STEED and MRS. PEEL, Volume 1 - A VERY CIVIL ARMEGEDDON - 2013] I must admit, I was leery about this one, being a Cold War kid who grew up watching this iconic TV show as soon as it hit the states on ABC (back when networks mattered, of which there were then only three) and not wanting to see it reimagined or rebooted, let alone being brought into today's techworld. After all, can you imagine Steed on a cell phone texting, tweeting, using an Ipad app, or checking his social media status instead of driving around in vintage autos, wearing his Bowler hat and custom-made suits, and sipping fine brandies and clarets? Heaven forbid.And, thankfully, this did not happen. What we are presented with is a perfectly paced, wonderfully witty, faithful to the extreme episode of the Avengers (screw Disney and Marvel for buying the rights to the name for the superhero franchise, which I also loved as a kid) as we knew it then. Bravo. It starts just like the fittingly formulaic episodes, even down to the campy, colorful titles along with the 'Steed feels his age, Emma turns back time' wordplay and the ""Mrs. Peel, We're Needed"" prologue before each story begins - it's absolutely classic. The witty, cheeky repartee between Emma and Steed is there in all its barbed glory, the whole 60's Spy thing played for both thrills and laughs, the archetypal villains abound, the finale is exact in its execution leaving a wry smile on one's lips, there's absolutely nothing missing for aficionados of this British dynamic duo. It's faultless to a tee and comes highly recommended.The artwork (for the most part) is close enough to the characters images a majority of the time, but periodically lacks in detailed facial resemblances, yet at other moments is spot-on. The look and color scheme is very 60's, and the cover gallery and sketches at the book's ending is both extensive and beyond fabulous. Joseph Michael Linsner does 4 or 5 astonishing paintings of Mrs. Peel that capture every nuance of her look and character right down to her patented perky, sexy, dimpled smile, and he wardrobes her in the most stylishly mod jumpsuits that left young men back then in puddles of drool. Why did we not have women who dressed like that on this side of the pond? But I digress - just hit the 'buy it now' button and be done with it; you'll thank me later. As soon as I finished this, I pre-ordered the second volume which will be out on November 5th, in hardcover no less.(A word of caution to the young'ins though - if you didn't have exposure to the show and characters and have no reverence for the past, you're not likely to find much here for your Transformers-and-apocalyptic-supervillians-from-galaxies-beyond and CGI laced 3D acid trips that began as comics - this is noteworthy nostalgia for those who prefer more earthly and subtle entertainment. You know - ornery old codgers like moi.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2T4QWKTLL09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608863069#wasThisHelpful","RC2T4QWKTLL09","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely superb likeness, detail and articulation of Spidey's archnemesis, the Green Goblin, that one could hope for. Expertly cast, perfectly painted, astonishing details in his facial features, hands, costuming and pumpkin. Delightfully creepy and larger than most Goblin busts, which usually don't come with full arms, hands or a full back profile. This impressive, expressive  and extremely limited edition likeness is a waist-up replica of one of comics most feared and beloved villians. In the 60's, he was to Spidey what the Joker was to Batman - crazed, comical, fearsome, menacing and hand-wringingly welcome in every issue he appeared in, unlike the movie version which, truth be told, absolutely sucked. The only better bust on the market (at time of this review) is Sideshow's Green Goblin bust, which I also own, but is much more expensive. This is the best pumpkin bang for your buck; a treasured example of what made Marvel magnanamous both then and now.

"Unfortunately, this is the weakest thing I've read by Ron Marz, who has never disappointed me prior to this. It's not bad, mind you, it has its moments, but its over-ambitious storyline is never fully developed to truly come to fruition. This 'kitchen-sink' tale has too many characters and suffers because none of them ever come to the foreground long enough to satisfy those who bought it for their love of a particular character. I'm a huge Vampirella fan, and she has a fair amount of page space, but not enough to satiate me. Red Sonja, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes? They're only peripheral figures as well, just like everyone else. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, and the tale seems truncated in many areas. Over-arching is its own undoing here - if it went on for more than its seven-issue run, it might have accomplished more, it needed to accomplish more, and promised to. But it fell back on the sword of its promise and died an early death.As a fan of all the characters presented here, I wanted to love it so much more than I did. Maybe my expectations were too high, but my disappointment was equally high. And I am a fan of Ron Marz, I've read almost everything with his name on it, just to be clear. The plot is almost identical to the one he wrote for his 'Artifacts' series, volumes 1-3 in TP, and there he had the luxury to plumb the plot properly, develop his characters and story in a way that's barely fleshed-out in this saga. My thought - if he scaled back a few characters, he would be able to make better use of them and thereby fulfill his audience's dreams and expectancies adequately.At the price it's offered for here, it's still worth a read for the curious, just don't expect the greatness guaranteed in theory by assembling the magnanimous cast in the credits. Which is a shame... 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0BRD828ZQHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606903993#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0BRD828ZQHU","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[SO YOUNG, SO LOVELY, SO VICIOUS - (1975) - Directed by Silvio Amadio - Widescreen presentation] Usually listed (and incorrectly so) as a gaillo, this film has more in common with trashy soap operas than the black-gloved, fetishistic serial killings of Bava, Argento, Sergio and Luciano Martino, Freda or their kin. It's actually a coarse retelling of Otto Preminger's excellent 'Bonjour Tristesse', minus any of the estimable aspects of that film, and should be avoided by all except stalwart fans of Gloria Guida and Dagmar Lassander.Angela (Gloria Guida), fresh out of high school, picks up her father from the airport, whom she hasn't seen in a year, and finds out he's planning on remarrying a woman named Irene (Dagmar Lassander) very soon. This doesn't sit well with Angela, and she does everything she can to insure that this union never sees fruition. She has her boyfriend attempt seducing her to no avail and then, after digging into Irene's past and finding mental abuse traumas stemming from a former lesbian relationship, decides she'll seduce Irene herself. This takes up three-quarters of the film, though we do see Gloria naked constantly insuring we never get too bored (truth be told, this doesnt work out nearly as well as you'd think), and Dagmar looks great in several of her costumes/outfits, but never gets undressed (somehow, as demented as this sounds, this makes her sexier as a result).When the Sapphic session between the older woman and the nubile girl finally does take place on a secluded beach setting, it's photographed by Angela's boyfriend to be utilized as a blackmail tool afterwards. As you'd expect, Angela has a sudden change of heart upon realizing Irene isn't the witch she once believed and now wants the negatives destroyed, Irene regrets the tryst and decides she must leave at once for the good of all concerned, but the boyfriend needs cash and still wants to go through with the blackmail. Irene is pushed beyond the breaking point, and the predictable tragedy results.A tawdry, sleazy 70's soap, this flick has precious little going for it apart from the soft-core elements, of which there are more than a fair share, but still somehow left me cold. And I have a high tolerance for the tedious when it comes to exploitation from the 70's. Recommended to hard-core Gloria Guida fans only.

"I got this item as part of Amazon's 4-for-3 sale program and no idea what I was getting into. The story makes for ridiculous reading, but I didn't read the first volume, so that may have something to do with it. But my gut tells me, probably not.It's reminiscent of a 'Heavy Metal' magazine story with the sexual elements cranked up to a Spinal Tap eleven, if you know what I mean. Futuristic, fetishistic women from another dimension feverishly fornicating with humanoid aliens on a meteor presumably (who really cares?) that are massively, monumentally endowed, and this continues for the duration of the entire book, which is its major strength. And then there's some Tarzan-type sexual gymnastics that are tossed our way, again with not much sense attached, but nonsensically entertaining nonetheless. I have little time to care about plotlines when I pick up an item of this sort. If I did, I might scratch my head in wonder; instead I ponder how these women hide the swollen girth and livestock-sized genitalia that they enjoy with shameless abandon. Anatomically impossible and hyper-erotic. And the women are a joy to behold, though in no way realistic either, with insatiable, aroused appetites of biblical proportions, assuming we're talking Sodom and Gomorrah. Ain't life grand?If you enjoy this sort of stuff, it's recommended. You do the math...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHCV0CSPBXWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062GMKNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3OHCV0CSPBXWM","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[ZETA ONE (AKA THE LOVE FACTOR) - 1969 - directed by Michael Cort - Widescreen] An early (and somewhat embarrassing) example of late 60's British sexploitation comedies, 'Zeta One' (originally titled 'The Love Factor') serves up a decent portion of softcore nudity, trippy psychedelic scenery, some unintentionally hysterical dialogue, some uncomfortable attempts at real comedy and, unfortunately, very little else. Except for a few beloved Hammer film Euro-lovelies like Valerie Leon, Dawn Addams, Anna Gael, Carole Hawkins and Yutte Stensgaard. And therein lies its worth.'Zeta One' was based on a short lived European photo-magazine that obsessed (rightfully so) on beautiful models scantily clad in futuristic clothing. At its liveliest, the film contains recreations of kinky photo-shoot favorites like catfights and fetish-fashioned femmes in torture chamber tableau, as well as colorful scenes of 'alien' women discreetly disguised in identical black wigs and thigh-high Carnaby Street fashions. Sounds fantastic, right? I thought so too, having a genetic weakness for 60's fashions and the bountiful babes who wore them. So shoot me, I was wrong. The original Salvation DVD release gave this as a synopsis - ""A race of topless, large-breasted women from the planet Angvia, in another dimension, come to earth to kidnap women to repopulate their planet"". Huh? And how might they procreate, if you don't mind my asking? And would you mind terribly if I watched? See, now there's your problem - when you screen flicks like this, these details shouldn't matter, 'cause most men stopped reading right after the ""race of large-breasted women"" part, and that's how it should be.The film's first quarter of an hour is a mercilessly motionless card game between Robin Hordon (the wooden male lead of 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth'), playing a poor man's James Bond, and office secretary Yutte Stensgaard as they drink, deliver pages of inconsequential dialogue and make furtive eyes at one other. Despite containing the film's first show of flesh, as they're playing strip-poker, this is pedantic padding at its most painful and just goes on forever. Eventually Hordon narrates flashbacks of some ""very extraordinary business"" concerning the Angvians, an interstellar race of women who kidnap lovely girls then brainwash them with kaleidoscopic optical effects. One such abductee gets hustled into a car by Angvian women in broad daylight then treated to a guided tour of their futuristic lair, which resembles the set of a children's TV program. Angvian headquarters includes such acid-induced deliriums as the 'Contemplation Room', the 'Self-Revelation Room' and let's not forget the unflappable 'Static Time Area' (as if we could). Where's 'Star Trek' era William Shatner when you need him most?  'Still with me? Frankly, I'm shocked...The cinematic 'climax' serves as the film's inglorious highlight with stunning starlets as alien women running naked around the British countryside freezing their backsides off while pretending to fire invisible rays from their hands, and trying (in one instance failing) not to break out laughing. Whilst Eurovixen Brigitte Skay managed to drum up a fair amount of publicity for the film - photos of her in a revealing space-age bikini earned 'Zeta One' the cover of both Continental Film Review and Cinema X magazine - it wasn't until the 1995 video re-release that the film really found an audience, having since gone on to achieve a degree of novelty status due to many of its female cast members (nearly) finding success in Hammer horror and 'Carry On' comedy roles. Not that many of these actresses have fond memories of the production, mind you. Yutte Stensgaard claimed she felt exploited by her then father-in-law/manager who in a surreptitious turn didn't tell her about her nude scenes until she arrived on set, while the late Imogen Hassall was known to joke that a higher force must have been guiding her the day she turned down the role of an Angvian angel. Valerie Leon's sole memory of the production was that one-movie director and screenwriter Michael Cort being a somewhat strange bloke. Then again, if you've seen this film, you've probably guessed that already.It's as simple as this - if you've got a penchant for silly 60's sexploitation films with knock-out babes running rampant topless in pendulum-swinging retro fashions, you'll enjoy it (once). Everybody else needs to avoid this one entirely, or you'll think you got stuck in the 'Static Time Area' indefinitely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y8J5FOCZSPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOCDEHK#wasThisHelpful","R26Y8J5FOCZSPA","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raven Gregory has constructed a caustic, cautionary yet comical tale here concerning every man's buried fantasy; you know, the one where we wish we were attractive, make that irresistible, to every desirable woman we encounter. And, as a by-product, a few undesirable ones, but hey, ya gotta roll with the punches sometimes, right? Besides, it does a heart good to throw somebody a charity boning just to give something back to the community, yes? It's the stuff of legends, and it's plumbed here with great results.So we have a loser here whose woman dumped him and left him in a world of suck over a year ago and now performs a selfless good deed and is granted one wish by the woman he saved from a mugging in an alleyway one night. He mentions he'd like not to be invisible to the ladies, not have to eat alone in a woman's prison, him being the pathetic piss-ant that he is. Next thing you know, every babe in toyland wants to bang his brains out, but he can't understand why. Suddenly, the world is his oyster (or clam, if you get the drift), and the finest female flesh is lining up for a shagging.Unfortunately, as soon as he screws their lights in (and out), they go all Jodi Arias on him - clinging, possessive, stalking and demanding him all to themselves. So the dream quickly descends into a nightmare before you can say 'restraining order' - it's a  classic take on the ""Careful what you wish for"" adage, and our newfound hero is still shackled to his hellhole of a world gone awry. And he's still unmercifully stuck on the bitch who dumped him, so he tries to track down the old woman who 'blessed' him with this woebegotten wish and have the spell reversed. Which ain't as easy as all that, trust me on this. Now things get really interesting, but you shouldn't know more than that before picking this one up for yourself.My only minor gripe is that I think Gregory could've expanded and enhanced this storyline, fleshed it out a bit more (what's wrong with a bit more flesh?), it seems a bit short. Another issue in the story arc would have really hit this one out of the park, and a tad more nudity would've aided as well. The dialogue is filthy as hell, and there is some mild exposed flesh (a breast here, a butt there), but nothing that equals the degeneracy of the dialogue, so there's an imbalance present that needn't be. What is here is gold, but a little extra helping of the aforementioned things would make this piece platinum. That's the only thing holding back the fifth star for this reader, but it's still an entertaining and engaging read for all redblooded hetero males everywhere.There's  the usual cover gallery, which is great and welcomed, but some shameless promos for two other Raven Gregory graphic novels pads out the remainder of the book, so the story page count you think you're getting when you sign up for this novella is truncated by the promo bits. Which is a slight drag, but not a detractor that would make you shy away from this otherwise ""Irresistible"" effort. Imagine this event happened to you, and think how you might have coped differently...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROYH8XPT53UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937068781#wasThisHelpful","R3ROYH8XPT53UQ","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[The Sex Thief AKA Her Family Jewels - 1973 - 88 minutes - directed by Martin Campbell - Widescreen]  The late David Warbeck (who later appeared in three Lucio Fulci horror films in the 80’s and a ton of other films) stars as Grant Henry AKA the Sex Thief in this silly but surprising 1973 British sex comedy. A writer of trashy paperbacks, Henry moonlights as a masked jewel thief who is usually caught in the act but lures his female captors to bed. He is a criminal by choice, not by necessity. Bedroom gyno-gymnast that he is, the women all lie to the authorities about his identity and secretly hope to get burgled again and again.A shameless Hollywood producer and a ditzy blonde wannabe movie star try to drum up publicity by claiming that the notorious thief assaulted her. Enraged and engorged that his name has been tarnished, our beloved Sex Thief purchases a toy gun and stalks the actress. In a forced apartment entry, he catches her in the bath before the pair passionately reenact her made up fantasy scenario. Typically dimwitted and corrupt cops more interested in peddling contraband blue movies (porn in today’s vernacular) than catching the thief also become involved for comedic effect. Despite the softcore stereotype of the British sex-comedy film, this one is fairly well made and occasionally funny, mildly sexy and  a fairly flagrant female fleshfest. Michael Armstrong, who acts in the film as a breast obsessed cop, wrote the screenplay under the demonic alter ego Edward Hyde, is most familiar to exploitation fans for the much maligned and frequently banned ‘Mark of the Devil’ as well as the autobiographical ‘Eskimo Nell’, another Brit sex comedy from that time. The version of this flick known as ‘Her Family Jewels’, had brief notoriety when it resurfaced with some hardcore insertions before being yanked (puns intended) from circulation. Another discovery is actress Gloria Walker AKA Gloria Maley who went from being well-worked over by Warbeck's buzzing stimulator here to providing the blood and guts special effects for 1980’s ‘Inseminoid’ (ugh) - a more diverse career move is hard to imagine. ‘The Sex Thief’ marginally rises above the typical British sexploitation comedy from that era thanks to some pointed raunchiness, a somewhat subversive script and a charismatic leading man. Oh yeah, and a boatload of nudity, which is the only reason to watch flicks like these. No one under 40 will appreciate it, it’s for old codgers (like me) to wax nostalgic over, remember the miniskirts, fashions and marvel at how different times were and how women looked then.The remastered edition is in widescreen, where earlier editions were only available in full screen, and a decent clean-up of picture, color and contrast are noticeable. So if you want to recapture stolen moments from the bygone era of your wayward youth and pilfer a snicker or three in the process, snatch yourself a copy of ‘The Sex Thief’. All else should consider yourself duly warned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DX9OJYMB9JGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NI2XL4#wasThisHelpful","R2DX9OJYMB9JGJ","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[BARBARIAN CHICKS AND DEMONS, Volume 1 - Erich Hartmann - 2008] Want a deliciously twisted medieval history lesson rife with sexual degeneracy? Who doesn’t? Well, here it is, gents, and it’s brimming with page after page of great graphics and neorealist illustrations depicting some truly perverse ‘Decamerotica’. Each chapter even has a coherent storyline, sarcastic banter and a twist for an ending in most situations (not that it really matters, but it sure helps). It’s clever, concise and delivers exactly what you’re looking for when you get the hankering for filthy, smutty fun.We’re treated to naughty nuns, Inquisitors, barbarians, priapian priests, fertility spells and idols, decadent castle guards, endowed servants, scheming merchants, pagan rituals, demons, succubii, compromised virgins and female sexual predators. It’s perfect. The sexual scenarios are many, varied, graphically portrayed and as life-like as you can get in a graphic novel. And the women aren’t victims for the most part; they frequently turn the tables on the men, knowing we don’t usually think with our larger heads. Great stuff. There’s not much more that can be said without being censored or offending the ‘sensitive’ minds of some readers here, but I can honestly state that this is what you want in a digest of this type. Erich Hartmann has done an incredible job, and as soon as I finished this volume, I threw 2 more of his works in my cart.

"[GIRL IN CAPTIVITY; PSYCHO TORTURE CHAMBER - 2008 - 74 minutes - Japanese w/ English subtitles] This entry from Cinema Epoch's Tokyo Erotique series is better than some of their other releases, as it avoids most of the clichéd story traps we've come to accept as part of our Asian exploitation adventures. Not your typical women in prison, cages, forced factory slaves or nympho killing machines - not that I'm critical of such trash; after all, how do you think I became Dr.NoItAll in various exploitation circles?  (And I'm still not certain this is something I should be proud or shamed of...).A cute Asian teen (possibly very young adult) awakens in a strange boiler room, chained to pipes, realizing she's been kidnapped by possibly the most bizarre captor I've seen (outside of a horror torture porn flick) - what appears to be a Sumo wrestler with a gas mask and voice camouflage who enters the room like he's headed for a WWF cage fight.  Thankfully for the teen, this isn't the case; it's just a bout of fondling and ""Getting to know you, getting to know all about you"", before he does a few Sumo warm-ups, demanding that she ""Cheer for him... with vivacity"", then exits, stage left.The hostage is the daughter of a tycoon who's on the verge of a large corporate merger in Beijing and might be being blackmailed for an ongoing affair he's been having with his personal secretary - but the kidnapper's true intentions are kept mysterious. The negotiations boil down to ""Cancel the merger and I release your daughter"" - it's obvious the kidnapper knows the father, but from where?Not to worry, we're treated to twofold sexcapades - sexual scenarios of the father's infidelities with his secretary as well as those between hostage and captor. The first is fairly straightforward, the second fairly perverse. Nothing heinous or horribly shocking though (then again, I'm numb to a lot of bats*** crazy stuff). Add a bit of Stockholm Syndrome, a surprise identity revealed, some more flesh, a few deaths and an almost touching ending and you have a slightly different take on transgressive cinema. It's worth a gander for those reasons alone. And, thankfully, there's no real torture going on. I was sick of that drivel years ago.This is much better than the 'Girl in Captivity; Hitwoman in Chains 2' IMO. In the final analysis, it's just more Asian exploitation, or `Exploit-Asian' as I call it, but if you've read this far, we're choir mates, so sing for the psycho and the `Girl in Captivity'. 4 stars (for this genre entry).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DQOPUK7F1ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006V7XGAW#wasThisHelpful","R35DQOPUK7F1ZY","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How many times do you read a graphic novel that actually makes you think while you read? How many make you stop reading to examine the dark, offbeat and unique spin of the artwork page by page as you're doing so? And how few do you pick up again after you've finished reading to re-examine each page several times to marvel and make sure you didn't miss a detail or nuance? This obscure gem is one of those very few that make these things happen, and therein lays just some of its greatness.Part psychological horror, part noir-ish murder mystery, part existential terror tale with hefty helpings of gothic dread, implausible peripheral characters and visceral phantasmagoria all make this a suspenseful read, and I'm not easily impressed nor a huge fan of your typical graphic novels. But I was mesmerized by this one, enough to read it again the next day. The philosophical questions asked alone make you take pause to ponder their implications at several points during the read, but aren't ponderous or off-putting - it's not trying to impress with its intelligence or self-importance, let's be clear about that. This is entertainment that enlightens, assuming you let it. But it's still cool if you don't. Either way, it's a riveting read.It's difficult to describe, but it involves marginalized people with dark secrets who end up in a place called Green Wake, unaware of how they got there and unable to leave. Most are so dysfunctional, disenfranchised and mentally destitute they don't speak to anyone and rarely venture outdoors. Except the two male protagonists, who've taken it upon themselves to act as both detectives determined to discover why they're suddenly residents and act as welcoming committee to the newly arrived, to assist with the shock of this huge void. And suddenly there's a rash of grisly murders all connected to one female inhabitant who apparently snapped and clings to the darkness that envelops all who reside at Green Wake, a place where it's always night and next to nothing makes sense. A purgatory or limbo of squalor that has far too many dark secrets, nightmarish visions and an unusually ever-growing population of frogs. Frogs?To say more would deprive you of the surreal psychosis that waits should you elect to find yourself entrenched in the pages of 'Green Wake'.Highly recommended. So 'Wake' up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25URZ48FAQHFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607064324#wasThisHelpful","R25URZ48FAQHFD","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[China and Sex - 1994 - directed by Joe D'Amato (using the name Robert Yip) - 90 minutes - Full Frame] MYA's DVD for China and Sex is a typically mediocre affair from the label whose name is an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience'. It features a sub-par full frame transfer that looks no better than it might have on VHS. There's plenty of damage to the print and no restoration was even attempted. The film is fuzzy overall, lacks contrast of any kind and the colors are decidedly washed out. The two-channel mono sound isn't much to celebrate, but it's better than the image. Dialogue is clear enough, but any music or background noise is too diminished to really notice. And, typical of MYA, there are no extras. Predictable MYA fodder, abusive to those who purchase their products, which has become more than tedious through time (read my other reviews of MYA'S travesties, as I'm tired of trashing their releases here on Amazon).Content wise, this film echoes many of the themes that D'Amato explored in his similarly-themed and equally awful film 'Chinese Kamasutra', which he also did under the name Robert Yip. The plot revolves around a dancer named Tama, who works at a sleazy brothel, but is unattainable unlike the other girls there (how does this work? You're there to make money and degrade yourself in the process, right? Am I missing something regarding the rules of engagement in such an establishment?). She is not the type of woman that money can buy; in fact the only way in which someone gets to spend the night with her is if they are chosen by her. Enter a wealthy man who sets his sights on her, only to be spurned time and time again. It is only when he is willing to let everything he has go that she finally picks him. Unfortunately what he seeks may not be what he is ultimately looking for. Let's just say that pleasure and pain goes hand in hand when it comes to conquering Tama. The erection-eradicating and shocking ending is the film's only merit, if you could call it that, but most of you will have drifted off long before it arrives. Oh Joe, what have ye done to us now?People who actively seek out the films of Joe D'Amato have no real reason to skip 'China and Sex', but it's weaknesses are apparent from the get go. When Joe has his heart in a flick, the results can be surprising. That isn't the case here; the same can be said of any of his films from the 90's (except his hardcore flicks, which were far better than any of his soft-core sleep-aids from this period). It's worse than most of his work and features some very unintentionally funny, ultra-pretentious dialogue. It's a terrible movie by any employable standard of calibration, even by low-rent exploitation standards, and everybody else should definitely skip it. Save your coin and order Chinese take-out instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFTAOMHXJ3J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GP7EJO#wasThisHelpful","R1VFTAOMHXJ3J4","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Tranceptor: Iron Gauge - Part One] I was unfamiliar with Michael Manning's work until I received this, but after reading reviews of his various works here on Amazon, my expectations were high. Maybe too high, which could be a fault of my own. Then again...The story is weak (not a real problem, as this is not generally why we buy such material), the artwork was adequate but far from mind-blowing (I've seen better, much better), and there was too little of what I signed on for - adult material. It's more of a second rate comic with a bit of explicit sex peppered here and there, instead of a full blown (pun intended) sexual saga. Frankly, I was disappointed, unlike most of the other reviewers here. I wrote my two cents so that potential buyers could acquaint themselves with the other side of the coin before making a purchase they might not be enthralled with, as I was.

"[Visions of Giovannna -2003- 46 pages] Italian illustrator and sexual exhibitionist Giovanna Casotto does a nice job of placing herself under our microscopes while engaging in fairly pedestrian sexcapades (meaning there's nothing kinky or transgressive going on here) that are well drawn and realistic. Meaning everyone's endowments are realistically proportioned and not hyper-exaggerated as in most examples of this 'artform'.She takes photos of the scenarios (how does one apply for this job, is what I kept asking myself) and then almost traces them to look as lifelike as possible. It's mostly pencil and ink, with washes of muted color added, so it's not comic-booky but higher caliber embellished illustrations. There are seven scenarios staged within, all male/female or female/female, but all conjured seductively for our hetero-hijinks. Very European, very graphic, as it should be if you're gonna bother with this sort of thing (which seems quaint and archaic in today's world of gonzo cyber-porn and what's available right outside our doors), but also makes me wonder how many do read these anymore for just those exact reasons?Anyway, if you appreciate an almost classy (I know, oxymoronic) European fumetti form of erotica, this isn't half-bad, and for those that obviously do, it's rather enticing and enjoyable. Rest assured, this is no 'Tijuana bible'. (Too)short, sweet and to the point.

"[Vampirella Volume 1: Crown of Worms TP - Eric Trautmann, author - 2011 - Dynamite Publications]For my money, the newer Vampi stories written by Eric Trautmann are among the best and truest to our beloved character, never looking backward, never ignoring what has come before, and always improving on the elements we've come to love and expect from this iconic (and very first) badass supernatural supervixen. Compiled here are the first seven issues of Dynamite Publications ongoing (and still worth reading) series, with fantastic artwork by Fabio Neves (#1-6) and Walter Geovanni (#7). This collection also benefits greatly from the most extensive and gorgeous cover art gallery in any Dynamite collection yet.Trautmann has given Vampi a welcomed character makeover - she's smarter, jaded, cynical, cunning, more visceral and methodically murderous when she has to be than in the past. She's a female version of Joss Whedon's 'Angel' character, only more complex and much easier on the eyes - much, much easier. The story moves briskly, is darker than those that preceded it, the body count elevated, the kills brutal and occasionally humorous (and I wonder why I scare people). On top of all that, Dracula emerges again, though this time in a different form, there's a Lovecraftian element I can't go into here, and Vampi gains a human sidekick by the time the saga concludes. What more could one possibly ask for?Don't be put off by the cover art (which is facially childish, unless you're one of J. Scott Campbell's legion of fans of pin-up 'good girl' art) - there's none of that inside, and that's what made me wait so long to add this one to my collection. Amazon's 'Look Inside' feature finally made me see the light of greatness within the book.

"[Vampirella Masters Series, Volume 5 - 2011 - Dynamite Publications] This, for me, was the weakest edition of the Dynamite collections we'll ever see (thankfully), as they were dredging up some old fodder from 1991-92 with the 'Morning in America' story, which originally appeared in B+W and heralded Harris Comics 're-vamping' of this icon. Adding color makes it look even worse though, more comic-like than later editions. The story was sluggish, the artwork the worst I've seen in any Vampi tale, the page layout like something from an early 60's DC comic. It's dated, uninspired and our luscious heroine never looked worse or more sexless (how is this possible?), and had a bad hair day too. In spite of the reemergence of old Warren key players like Pendragon and Adam, it's pretty much a write-off (no pun intended). It's almost 200 pages of convoluted confusion, and too wordy trying to stretch back in Vampi's mythos while moving forward in a 90's timeline, but ends up like being on a treadmill - when all's said and done, we've gone nowhere. Kurt Busiek is just an acceptable writer who seems to constantly be rehashing old characters and villains (the Cult of Chaos, The Crimson Chronicles) from the golden age of Warren Vampirella sagas without really adding much of his own vision, IMO.Thankfully, this edition's salvaged by the artwork of Jim Balent and Louis Small Jr. in the four-part 'Dracula War' from 1993 and, though it too was penned by Kurt Busiek, the combo of story and art is a vast improvement, and reason enough to bag this if you never read it before. Almost all the Dynamite collections are essential reading for Vampi aficionados, some are downright glorious (read my reviews of all), but this one doesn't offer much bang for your Dynamite buck. 3 stars at best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UTIO2A909EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606902350#wasThisHelpful","R21UTIO2A909EW","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been collecting the Vampi compilations from Dynamite for a while, but this particular volume (the first) was always too pricey for a trade paperback, at least from my perspective. I also own a few hardcover Harris Publications Vampi comps, and found them wellbound and of high quality.One day while searching, I found a brand new copy of this Harris version at a cheaper price + immediately grabbed it, ultimately being very glad I did. The cover's thicker stock, the binding better and there's a few extras not included in the Dynamite edition (not that I'm knocking them - I own all of their other volumes and pre-ordered the latest edition as well).That said, the Grant Morrison/Mark Millar collaborations were among the finest writen tales of our voluptuous vampire vixen, the three issue story arcs allowing them to stretch out and add additional dimension, dialogue and depth to what was sometimes breezy, silly, lightweight tales in some of Harris' other work in the 90's. Our Vampirella deserved much better, and she got her pedestal elevated in these sanguinary sagas that never disappoint or come up short.Regardless of which publisher you go with, these are essential chronicles in the series and belong in every aficionado's collection. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO76V9RACS6GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0910692939#wasThisHelpful","RO76V9RACS6GC","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A decent read and good B+W illustrations punctuate this collection of EC/Warren inspired terror tales, but when I was finished, I still wanted more. 'Don't really know if it's my gluttony or the shortcomings of the finished product, but something was lacking somewhere.Most of these tales had roots in Eerie and Creepy magazines and appeared little more than rewrites; others had mediocre endings or finales you saw coming as an aficianado of supernatural sagas. I believe the quality of the artwork surpassed the storytelling. And yet the tales, some of which were marginal, weren't bad either. It's just not any kind of improvement over Uncle Creepy or Cousin Eerie's roster of formidable talent back in the early to mid 70's, IMO. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the indulged time, but would I prefer it to the classics? Not on your life, or death for that matter.

"Demented and delirious, these tales are all interesting + worthy of attention, yet of varying quality, but the artwork is truly exceptional. Even some of the one-page 'Case Studies' of horrific, Lovecraftian (I know, an over-used expression, but it fits here) inmates at the Asylum will raise a sickly snicker.Much like an update of the old Warren publications from the 60's + 70's like Creepy and Eerie, so if those appeal to you in a slightly updated mode, sign yourself into the Asylum.Don't forget there's a shorter second volume available (one of the tales is continued in vol. 2) and a third was promised, a release date given, but no availability as of yet.

"[SAME TIME EVERY YEAR - 1981 - Directed by Fred J. Lincoln] Though it may not be considered a 'hardcore classic', this film plays to the strengths of Fred Lincoln's talent for near wall-to-wall sex scenes, energetic performances and a bevy of fine female talent. The plot is established in the first five minutes, thankfully, and then we're witness to scene after scene of what we signed on for.With actresses/performers like Tiffany Clark, Loni Sanders (in 2 scenes), China Leigh, Lee Carroll, Holly McCall and Kathy Harcourt, among others, you're bound to find a few babes that appeal to your erotic fantasies. As far as the men are concerned, who cares? Do I care if hedgehog Ron Jeremy is in this? Not on your life; I've never seen someone as repugnant as that clown in a porn film, and my heart bleeds for the women assigned to have sex with him, but I digress.

"[SERENA - AN ADULT FAIRY TALE - 1980] Director Fred Lincoln (along with his woman/wife and porn actress Tiffany Clark) made quite a few solid porn flicks in the late 70's, but this one's weak all around. I guess it helps if you find Serena attractive, but I've always considered her a third tier tramp with decent oral skills. Nothing more. And none of the other actresses are all that memorable, except China Leigh, as there weren't many Asian porn actresses during the 70's and 80's (unlike today, where they're incredibly abundant).The fairy tale plot wears thin immediately, and remember these folks aren't actors, they're performers, so you're just killing time until the next sex scene, again none all that memorable. You'll probably fast-forward through half the film. It's nice that Synapse is releasing some retro American erotica to go along with their Nikkatsu Asian softcore flicks from the late 70's/ early 80's and the German 'Schoolgirl Report' series from the early to mid 70's, but today's audience that grew up on gonzo porn and plotless filth will find nothing of interest here. Keep that in mind.Synapse is also releasing 'Same Time Every Year' on the same date, and that's a much superior entry and enjoyable flick with finer babes and less down time that I'd heartily recommend over this one. Unless you're a Serena fan, pass on this one + go for the other. Your degeneracy will thank you later.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BZAK0WC3YUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKLLSOG#wasThisHelpful","R5BZAK0WC3YUY","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"And how the hell did it ever get released? By now, Vincent Price was entrenched in low budget, factory-formulaic yet memorable and mostly enjoyable B flicks for the Corman / Zarkoff stable over at International; how he ended up here is both uncertain and welcomed, as his typically overly-theatrical narrative gave William Shatner something to aspire towards yet provides a coherently campy eccentricity that actually adds much to this surrealistic fever dream. And just what was anyone thinking when they came up with this title? No one in the early 60's was familiar with DeQuincy's 'Confessions of an English Opium Eater' from 1821 (acknowledged as the first serious literary work concerning drug use so prevalent then). It wasn't taught in colleges and didn't enjoy resurgence until ten years later when drug use was in vogue and most professors were themselves experimenting. This film has oddities to the tenth power written all over it. This is probably why I enjoyed it.There's no dialogue for the first eleven minutes, it's more like a graphic novel than film, ripe with pulp novel imagery regarding Chinese slave women abducted for auction at the turn of the century San Francisco, mythic Tong wars running rackets, seaports, opium and slavery, and Asian stereotypes from said time-frame (which is excusable at the time the film was made as well as what little we Americans knew of Asians back in the early 1900's, as they were known for both furtive secrecy and non-assimilation, like most immigrants then). And there's that symbolic, surreal white horse that plays a pivotal role in that first beach scene; later recognized as a well-known metaphor for heroin, derived from opium. Whew. And from here it only gets stranger. Much stranger.Enter Price, a sea-faring roustabout both penniless and on an odyssey, sorta like a turn-of-the-century Charles Bukowski spewing cryptic Charlie Chan-isms to rightfully untrusting Chinese comic book characters each more deceitful than the last. But I don't insinuate for a second that these remarks are unbecoming, rather they add a flavorful flair of the phantasmagoric that lends much to what would otherwise be a dreadful viewing experience. Equal parts film noir, pulp novel, theatrical drivel, racy melodrama, European fumetti and no budget action flick - if it was made a few years later, it would have been a great Jess Franco flick.So as Price, a descendant of Thomas DeQuincy's a hundred years later (and the only thread of continuity to the film's title), attempts to save a young woman from the impending slave auction that takes place later that night where women are bartered for opium, he encounters more trap doors and secret passageways than a hundred spy films while meeting odd characters and savage henchmen brandishing huge swords, bamboo cages with slave girls who must dance provocatively for their potential buyers while a few red herrings are tossed our way, none believable but all enjoyable. Does any of this make sense? `Doesn't much matter, you'll either love it or hate it, the latter group probably ceased reading a while ago.It's a two star film for the Criterion snob, four stars to those who appreciate cinematic oddities, cult, camp and the transgressive taste buds.

"Classic retro replica of the villianous Dr. Doom is quite impressive at 14""'s in height (including base), looking ominous from his vantage point atop Castle Doom's watchtower. Excellent articulation, fantastic flowing cape, arms crossed defiantly as he plots his next onslaught against his varied enemies, highly detailed watchtower with gargoyle heads sprouting at various points. All Silver Age Marvel + Fantastic Four fans will want this for sure, BUT NOT AT THE PRICES ASKED HERE at the time of this review.You can nab this nefarious monarch on ebay and other sites for anywhere from $150 (a lucky low-end auction) to $275.00 retail, so don't fall prey to the ""Sucker's-gotta-have-it-now-so-I'll-rob-him-blind"" larceny here and elsewhere. No offense to the sellers, they're just capitalizing on the supply + demand dynamic that oil companies utilize everyday. But robbery is robbery regardless. When there's only one or two sellers offering an item on Amazon, you can bet you'll be paying too much for it. (Another oddity I run across frequently talking to other collectors is that ebay people tend not to be Amazon shoppers, and vice-versa. I buy anywhere I can ge the best price - sometimes/mostly it's Amazon + other ocassions it's elsewhere, but it pays to do your research.

"[WAVES OF LUST - 1975 - Widescreen 1.85:1 - In English or Italian w/ English subtitles - directed by Ruggero Deodato - 88 min.] Although he had a highly respectable career as a television and commercial director, Ruggero Deodato is best remembered for his notorious exploitation classics, 'Jungle Holocaust' (1977), 'Cannibal Holocaust' (1980) and 'The House on the Edge of the Park' (1980). He even directed a notable crime drama 'Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man' (1976), but this entry from the previous year is unlike his known body of work, for better or worse. BTW, Lamberto Bava was only one of four co-writers here, and had nothing to do with its direction.Two couples bump shoulders at a seaside resort, one wealthy, one not, and get entangled in each others crosshairs with typically wretched results. Highly despicable and wealthy financier Giorgio (John Steiner) and his virtual slave of a lover and part-time subject of abuse, Silvia (Elizabeth Turner), hook up with Irem (Al Cliver) and Barbara (Deodato's wife, Silvia Dionisio) for a weekend cruise aboard Giorgio's massive yacht for a protracted and provocative game of cat and mouse. Not one of the four is under any illusion that this is a simple pleasure trip; Giorgio has had designs on Barbara since he first laid eyes on her ashore, Barbara suspects the levels of physical and mental abuse heaved upon Silvia by her husband and appears to plan retaliation while possibly sleeping with the brutal bastard, Irem knows of the intentions of both Giorgio and his own mate and is apparently indifferent (or is he?), and poor Silvia is desperate for attention and respite from her abuser, secretly plotting a love triangle with the other couple, who conspire against the ruthless misogynist who's also a paranoid alcoholic. Got all that?While complications pile up, so does the clothing as all four spend most of the flick naked or near-nude, whether diving underwater, changing for dinner, tempting and teasing one another, sunbathing, making love or engaged in Sapphic massages. There's an over-abundance of sleazy 70's Euro-grindhouse nudity but, thankfully, both women are easy on the eyes and seeing them prance and preen is pleasurable for voyeurs like me. (Most women believe that there's no such thing as being too rich or too thin; most men believe that there's no such thing as too much female nudity...) Deodato's camera lingers on the flesh lovingly and longingly - it's a pervert's paradise, which is odd when you factor that one of the women flaunted is his own wife. But don't mistake this as a complaint on my part.By the time the proceedings are about to wrap up, we viewers feel as though we've spent too much time with these unlikable, scheming characters too, and can't wait to see the impending debacle unfold but, until then, we sit awash in 'Waves of Lust' as the tides roll in. A 3 star film elevated to 4 due to the pervasive 70's Eurosleaze hurled at us by a true exploitation auteur.Once again, RARO VIDEO has delivered a beautiful remastered print w/ great audio, and has added several bonus features as well as a nice-sized collectible booklet. Considering the market for such product is so small, they truly must be commended for treating their fanbase so affectionately. All hail Raro Video!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABKIWTWJIBAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XF0XSE#wasThisHelpful","R2ABKIWTWJIBAG","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[ZOOM UP: The Beaver Book Girl - 1981 - Widescreen - Japanese w/ English subtitles - directed by Takashi Kanno] In an effort to park butts in movie house seats when XXX Porn was prevalent and Betamax video was all the rage in Japan, and consumers could watch subversive sleaze in the comfort of their own homes for the first time in seditious cinema history, Nikkatsu Studios had to push the transgressive boundaries of its releases to new heights (or lows, depending on your perspective) while remaining, if just barely, within the margins of softcore celluloid sex. No easy task, with results varying widely. The new films were rawer, rougher, more visceral and fetishistic than before, and the 'Zoom Up/ Zoom In' series is a perfect example.As an aficionado of Asian exploitation, and exploitation in almost all its incarnations (read more of my reviews as proof), I'm delighted Impulse Pictures is releasing these films for the first time on dvd, although I haven't been totally impressed with any of the three I've currently screened. That won't stop me from watching more of them, as I'm a bona fide sucker for this genre. But this entry has a particular twist I'm not a fastidious fan of, and it dominates the film, so if you don't take pleasure in it either, your overall enjoyment of this flick will be sorely compromised, as mine was. Not that I'm sorry I sat through it, my decadence is deep-rooted and decades old.The film begins with a rape and ends with a tsunami of golden showers, and you need to be informed of this before deciding if it's for you or not. I had no such knowledge, so I was taken aback by the deluge of urinating on others that crops up constantly - the rape thing is entrenched in Japanese cinema and its history, so there's no way around that. These are two elements that are off-putting to me, as I get no arousal from either, and find their inclusion in sexual activity totally alien to my own tastes. Though I make no pretense to criticize those that do, understand? Sex and violence are two entirely separate entities to me, and make for uneasy bedfellows, and scatting is just something nauseating in my head. Again, I'm not preaching to any choir here, I'm a degenerate in my own right, and in a free society, or at least a cheap one, I'm not passing judgment on anybody.The lead female actress is a fairly attractive MILF with an ample rack and come-hither sexuality in her eyes that's unmistakable, and we are treated to many scenes with her. My favorite was the one where she's bound outdoors to a wooden cross with bright red fabric tethers, fully exposed while being photographed and having intercourse (see - I've got issues all my own), but there are a few more as well. The only other female we see naked repeatedly in this flick is plainer than rice (and I mean nothing racial by that), obnoxious and off-putting, and has too much screen time. So variety is lacking too - it's either column A or column B (again, no racial bias intended, sometimes these things just write themselves). Thankfully, the main actress is unique enough to carry the films erotic content, at least for me anyway. Now if the producers would've just dialed back a bit on the golden showers, maybe my enjoyment wouldn't have drowned... 3 stars, but be forewarned, my freaky friends, when it rains, it pours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1406QI29XLCA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PZ6STK#wasThisHelpful","R1406QI29XLCA6","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Teenage Hitchhikers - 1974 (not '75) - Widescreen - directed by Gerri Sedley] Look, I'm not here to argue or belittle the other reviewers for this flick, to each his own, right? The film does not disappoint when it comes to abundant female nudity, carefree 70's shenanagins, silly humor and grindhouse ettiquette - but couldn't you come up with a few women someone would actually WANT to see naked? Therein lies my problem; these chicks are skanks, not worth rustling up after last call at your local watering hole back in the day. I lived in bars and topless joints during that time period, and these chicks wouldn't get hired to clean the bathrooms in said temples. Sorry for my bluntness, but someone's gotta call the shot. After a while, I'm sitting there hoping they'd put their clothes back on, or encounter some chick farther down the road who was just a bit higher in the desirability department.No one seemed to notice that that one chick was Claire Wilbur (Radley Metzger's 'Score') who played (what else?) a lesbian and didn't have enough screen time to counterbalance the mediocrity of the two lead actresses, and the third girl they added to the mix was even more unlikable and unbedworthy. Yeesch. During the film's 'climax', the orgy, I noticed both Marc Stevens and Eric Edwards (neither got screen credits), two guys who were porn superstars back then, and they looked too stoned and bored to care, while I was sadly just the latter.BTW, if you bothered to sit through the film, make sure you stick around for the trailers afterwards, it's the real highlight here - there are well over 15 trashy transgressive treats, any of which are better than the main attraction on this disc. DO NOT miss these...I've seen 'em all, and I'm still not certain if it's something I should be proud of or embarrassed to admit. Aww, who am I kiddin' - I loved these flicks!So, if you want to see an indiscriminate bunch of nudity and bad humor, feel free to indulge in this narcoleptic nostalgia; if you're looking for fine women prancing sans garments for arousal and enlightenment, please look elsewhere.

"[NINA - CRAZY SUICIDE GIRL - 2011 - Full screen - 80 minutes - Italian w/ English subtitles - directed by Christian Arioli] First, and most importantly, ignore the hyped details in the synopsis listed here, which are also on the dvd case, so no one's at fault except the rats promoting this swill. Sure, sure, ALL the ingredients for a great exploitation grindhouse paradise are depicted in the narrative, but the immature execution, lifeless acting, lousy direction and complete lack of budget negate any entertainment value entirely. So don't fall prey to the hype as I did, and often have as a lover of transgressive cinema. This clunker needs to remain under everyone's radar, except possibly the MST3K crowd and those seeking a new low in irredeemable films.On the surface, the stratagem appears watertight - a bunch of female models are coerced into doing gonzo porno before being kidnapped by an underworld mob-run video group that has ties to a satanic cult that captures and kills in pursuit of supreme occult power who are being tracked down by a bounty-hunting female assassin who utilizes Japanese swordplay to bring dark justice to the criminals when she's not using a blow-torch to wrangle info out of sleazy smut peddlers, gangsters and druglords - so how can you screw this up, for chrissakes, when it's absolutely golden in concept? Oh, let me count the ways...First, the female lead is wooden (leaden?) and too old for the role (a decent MILF maybe, but), exhibits no fighting skills and only uses a Katana sword once during the film - nothing like the grindhouse mixture of 70's Asian, Italian giallo and Tarantino pulp cinema influences touted here to sell this turkey. There are no highs, just lows, leaving every frame flat and thirsty for more of what we signed on for. There's a sprinkle of brutality and nudity, but not enough ultra-violence, bloodshed, undraped female flesh, satanic sleaze or indecent insanity to make a decent, enjoyable flick as described. You're better off watching a nostalgically bad but bona fide 70's Eurohorror or Italian crime drama by Fernando Di Leo (there'll be superior violence, gratuitous sleaze and better looking women) - this film wants to be those things, but comes off as disingenuous and deceptive, as well as poorly implemented. What a shame...In short, NINA's no GIRL, you'd have to be CRAZY enough for SUICIDE to suffer through after reading this review.

"[VAMPIRELLA MASTERS SERIES, VOLUME SIX]  Dynamite has done it again with this compiled edition of our favorite vampiric seductress's sagas, with solid roots in Greek, Roman and Christian folklore as penned by James Robinson, with bewitching and stunning neorealist artwork paintings by the incomparable Joe Lusko. A compelling rewriting of Vampirella's death, resurrection and backstory on her mother Lilith's true history, what actually transpired on Drakulon and how this all has ties to Hell and the river Styx, this tale's not to be missed by any Vampi fan, either new or old.'Bloodlust' is the main story and the real reason to sink your teeth into this book without hesitation, for the reasons outlined above, as well as others. Vampirella has never been rendered better or more realistically fetching to the eye, bone-fetching in fact. Lord knows there has never been a superior bloodsucking sexually superlative icon since she appeared on the cover of the first issue of her own Warren mag way back in 1969, brought to near-perfect realization by legend Frank Frazetta, and my bets are that there never will be. But here, she embodies all that is the core of her character, her conflicts, and her captivating carnality. Every panel is jaw-dropping, and to see Adam Van Helsing transformed into the Herculean anti-hero is another stroke of brilliance. It's mandatory for aficionados.'Vampi vs. Dracula' is a post-modern retelling of an original tale from 1972 that's well-done, especially for newer fans, though I believe the original was better (and it was in B+W!) and concerns the Cult of Chaos and the Crimson Chronicles, for those who remember such details or collect the also-excellent Vampirella Archive series from Dynamite. I'm not knocking it, I enjoyed it as a blast from the past.Lastly comes 'Two So Different', a thoughtful treatise on alternate or parallel planes, where Bram Stoker and Archie Goodwin (Vampi's original story-teller) sit in a library discussing the two very different tales of vampire characters they are currently penning and how history will remember them both. They are also sharing space with their two progeny, Drac and Vampi, one of whom thinks he can alter his future outcome by doing something unspoken to his creator, but his female counterpart has other ideas. It's a brilliant conception, but the artwork is the weakest offered here. But the novelty more than excuses this shortcoming.Without hesitation, I heartily recommend this edition to all possessing a beating heart, as 'Bloodlust' pumps sanguine and lust unequivocally. It does a heart good...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTYOEIQTBG8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606902504#wasThisHelpful","RQTYOEIQTBG8M","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up with Vampi, Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie, as well as a host of other similar publications as a kid and teen, but eventually grew out of them - notice I didn't say ""grew up"", because the propensity and weakness for such things really never goes away, no matter how old we get. It's always there, lurking in the recesses and quagmire of our inner psyche, and bubbles back up to the surface in later years, usually when a 'memory trigger' has been pulled.Decades later, I stumble upon Dark Horse editions of the beautifully bound Creepy and Eerie Archives and, lo and behold, memory triggers fired off, and soon enough I've got a shelf of them, along with several Vampirella Archives from Dynamite. So now I look into this collection of their Master Series and thanks to Amazon's great 'Look Inside' feature, I've now got three of these as well. I'm not 'into' comics anymore, for whatever reason (probably the comic art), but the neorealist artwork grabbed me immediately and, after reading this one, the stories are surprisingly solid and have substance I initially didn't think they would. One of those rare times when it feels good to be wrong, I guess.'Master Series' Volume Three presents us with the three-part 'Nowheresville' saga along with the two-part 'Fear of Mirrors', both exceptional tales with superb artwork. These stories would appeal to any  TV fans of 'Supernatural', 'Angel' or 'Buffy', as well as Vampi aficionados, new or old.  My favorite is the 'Nowheresville' story, as each part contains a writing style full of depth, twists, sarcasm and contemporary cultural references, along with the sexiest badass good-girl vampire ever committed to paper and pen. You can't go wrong with this edition; the artwork's astonishing and tales are top-tier.So take a trip to 'Nowheresville' - it's someplace special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPZ3WOQWYMKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606901958#wasThisHelpful","RUPZ3WOQWYMKZ","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great size, scale, detail and articulation - the robotic 'wing' moves up and down, the artificial leg is posable to get him propped up properly, and the other wing is on a ball joint so it rotates as well as moves up and down, so you can change his posture periodically when you get tired of him in just one position. His head turns too, but the icing is the blue chest button which lights up and provides about a half-dozen random electrical and mechanical sounds when pushed in - a very cool feature.An iconic image brought back to life for all fans of the Adult Swim empire.

"[THE OUTSIDE MAN - 1974 - Widescreen presentation - Directed by Jacques Deray] Seeing as how most of the other reviews are for the VHS edition of this flick, or penned by fans of Ann Margret (which I am as well, and fault no one for that), I thought I'd add a few remarks about the new MGM  Limited Edition release currently available.No attempt has been made by the studio to remaster, enhance or improve the print utilized here - it's prefaced with the statement, ""This film is presented using the best print available"", which isn't all that bad, actually, but in the era of blu ray and remastering, it's not all that great either. The audio is more than adequate for a film from this era, but the video colors range from a bit 'hot' in some of the outdoor scenes, of which there are many, to weak and spotty contrast in certain indoor and night sequences, and an overall flatness to the picture as a whole. Again, this shouldn't turn you away from watching, renting or buying this flick if you've got an interest, but there are no superlatives to encourage you to do any of those things either. But, that said, it is a solid yet anomalous movie with a great cast and a European ending as opposed to a Hollywood conclusion, which made it more attractive to me.The strange thing is, in spite of the excellent cast, no actor really makes the film their own - everyone is good, but no one is given enough screen time to dominate, or is ever established as the true central character or powerful enough to chew up the scenery to make it theirs either. 'Not necessarily a bad thing, but a bit peculiar given the talents involved. Jean-Louis Trintignant would appear the central figure, but his English isn't good enough to warrant giving him a ton of dialogue, as his accent is strong. Americans know him for his role in 'The Conformist' as well as 'And God Created Woman', the film that brought Brigitte Bardot international fame, but he's been in many a formidable French flick through the years. Roy Scheider, in a rare role as a bad guy hit man, has almost no dialogue whatsoever, which is a bit of a waste. Angie Dickenson has a scene in the beginning and one or two at the films conclusion, but is severely underutilized. That leaves Ann Margret, who is captivating in the scenes she's in, both sexy and emotive, but I wish she was in more scenes too. So we have a remarkable cast without anyone being unmistakably remarkable, and I think it has to do with the French writers, directors, cinematographers and additional cast members. Umberto Orsini also has a role on par with the rest of the cast; again unremarkable. Alex Rocco plays the same role he's played his entire life, a bodyguard and muscle enforcer for Orsini, whose presence is felt only at the end of the film.The script is solid, the action firm, it's never dull and concludes nicely for a European crime drama (in spite of the American cast), and is a pleasurable unpolished gem from that era - the other reviewers have already mined the plot, so there's no need for a re-hash from me - I'd recommend this movie to those who appreciate this genre and timeframe without hesitation. Just don't expect an impressive print for a limited release that carries a fairly hefty pricetag. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ND6FOVQYSDUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BJU4YE#wasThisHelpful","R2ND6FOVQYSDUP","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[SHELLEY'S CREATION - Quarantine Studios - 2012 - Limited Edition Statue] OK, it's not Karloff's immortal characterization or any of the second-rate stars who portrayed the creature in various films throughout the decades, but that shouldn't stop you freaks from throwing this in your cart ASAP.Quarantine Studio has constructed a great homage statue as described by Mary Shelley in what has become recognized as the first (and arguably the best) gothic horror novel of all time. The tombstone behind the creature has her name inscribed on it, along with her birth and death dates, and a quote from her novel about the monster. A nice touch.The monster is impressively constructed and rendered; his posture menacing, his body language threatening and chilling, and his facial features not too remote from the image we all see when we think of Frankenstein's Monster. Subtle differences abound, but all you could wish for is present as well. The flat skull and hairline, sloped brow, stapled flesh, dead yet undead eyes, silver metal plates, freshly-sewn stitches and additional knife-scars crowd his face, and his hands are amazingly articulated; he looks like he's prowling for something to strangle. Another original addage is the leg brace that takes over his right leg - metal plates, hinges and leather straps that hold the beast upright are truly unique. His clothing is perfectly aged, and even the brass buttons appear real. It's absolutely killin' for those of us who appreciate such detailed dementia.The only negative I can think of is that there's little contrast in the tomb, shattered cross and ground he stalks upon; a little more paint would've been nice and set up additional contrast and dimension, but I'm incredibly difficult to please when it comes to details.Here's a fact treat that should be notated in the product details - this statue is strictly limited to 100 pieces, which insures it's value at this pricepoint - Sideshow Collectibles products usually fetch $300-$500 for items that run from 250 to 1500 pieces, and I'm not knocking them, so this has an added scarcity attached to it - only 100 people will eventually own one (mine's # 20/100) - period. Now, how many Frankenstein fans are out there? Probably millions worldwide. He comes housed in a nice box and warrants a rightful place in your rec room, labratory, dungeon or crypt. Don't be braindead, give him a home, but by all means, keep him locked up, would'ya?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRLTQLR2LUV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VV64AY#wasThisHelpful","R2XRLTQLR2LUV6","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Hecto Pascal: Sensual Callgirl - (2009) - directed by Toru Kamei - fullscreen presentation - Japanese w/ English subtitles] Asian exploitation rarely lets me down, that's why I love it; a good deal of it borders on the insane and focuses on wildly deviant sexual behavior, but this clunker was the most torturously tame and insipid waste of 80 minutes I've experienced in ages. Everything about it is misleading, starting with the title - it's never concretely established if there even IS a Hecto Pascal, there's certainly no callgirl, it's definitely not sensual and, oh yeah, there's only one scene with ANY nudity at all. How can you market this as part of the 'Tokyo Erotique' series if there's no naughtiness or nudity? Gentlemen, I ask you in all sincerity, WTF? Before I go on, and for those of you with short attention spans, let's make one thing perfectly clear - you DO NOT want to suffer through this flick as I did, so you can cease reading now. It's devoid of any merit, immorality or indecency, rendering it without value of any kind, and my sainthood in the afterlife of cinematic degenerates is hereby guaranteed for having suffered so heinously so that you, my like-minded brethren, could go unpunished and spared from this tedium. My altar's being constructed as I write this...so is my pillory for being so foolish.For those of you still seeking torture, here are the details - A widow (Honoka) runs a funeral parlor in a poor fishing village, and is locally known as the ""Mortician Vulture"", and yes, she does indeed provide additional 'services' to the bereaved, but this we find out through dialogue and not depiction. She hires a partially deaf young man as part-time help, and takes an interest in him and his virginity. After a service one day, she instructs him to accompany her in the bathtub (I've seen larger fishbowls), but neither one gets undressed (?) - he's in a suit and tie, she's in a dress, shawl and pantyhose. So fully clothed we're to believe that this is somehow erotic. She washes his hair, then he hers, and I'm cringing in the social awkwardness of the severely dysfunctional characters. It's painful to watch.It's 56 minutes into this sleep aid before the first and only pair of breasts are exposed, and then only for a few seconds as the two have a go outdoors in the approaching typhoon. The pervading melancholy is mind numbing and the boredom relentless for an alleged 'erotic' film, though stating it as such is akin to calling Gov. Romney a liberal and Congress bipartisan. Every opportunity to show flesh (and there were many) was excised like foreskin at a bar mitzvah. Sure, there's a ton of talk about sex throughout the flick, but we see nothing. As a film, it fails all around too; no real plot or development, shallow characters, lousy direction and a weak soundtrack only serve to infuriate rather than entertain or invigorate.Do yourself a huge favor and pick up one of the excellent 'Tokyo Train Girl' flicks instead (read my reviews), or 'Captive Factory Girls' 1 or 2, even 'Girl in Captivity' from the same label (Cinema Epoch) for some enjoyable exploitation that won't disappoint - this one's unbearable. Amen.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32E3RYLW9GZG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062NAW7A#wasThisHelpful","R32E3RYLW9GZG9","AWA88F5TOX8VL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWA88F5TOX8VL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did not find the taste to be that of caramel.  It tastes more like light molasses to me.  It's not unpleasant (if you like molasses) though and would be a good alternative for some people.

It's a little thicker than ""normal"" syrup, but overall, I liked it, and the thickness didn't bother me.Note:  I tried it on Eggos and it was pretty good.  I prefer light syrup, but I noticed that I don't get the sugar-buzz-followed-by-needing-a-nap that ordinary syrup gives me.

"What a fun little item!  It has lots of little bells and whistles that are cool, though I did find the voice they used to be annoying.  Most kids probably won't though, since it's a sort of ""British fashion model"" type voice.  I found that the voice recognition on the password lock didn't work very well.  You have to say the word EXACTLY the same way (which I think a lot of kids will have trouble with, but they'll have fun trying) or it won't open.  But there is a reset button so that you can get into it if you need to.  It has a little compartment to hide things in, an ""invisible ink"" pen and a light to read the writing by, and a notebook to write in.

"A very nice little necklace.  It's about 3/4"" square and the shape and diamonds make it a delicate and slightly blingy accent.  I don't wear much silver, but this really is something that could go with anything from jeans and a t-shirt to that little black dress.  The chain is fairly short (probably 15""- 16"") and the catch is extremely small, making it a little difficult to fasten and unfasten without help, but if you don't have a significant other or a girlfriend to help you, a magnetic catch could be added to it, easily.

"I bought this because I have trouble with high dosage Vitamin B6, but I do need to take some every day.  Most Vitamin B6 comes in 100 mg or higher, but I have had trouble with what is sometimes referred to as ""Vivid Dreams"" when I take very much B6.  Some people like that and take high doses in order to experience it, but I found them TOO vivid.  I'd wake up convinced that I heard someone getting in my house, or a spider was on me.  Even after I woke up, I'd believe it was true for a minute or two.  I'd actually HEAR somebody at the door.  I found it terrifying.  When I discovered the B6 was causing it, I started trying to find a lower dose B6 so that I wouldn't have to split the pills into 12 or 16 pieces.  This brand is 10 mg, so I can split it in 4 pieces and do fine.  That still gives me the daily requirement, but I don't have the dreams.

"I usually refer to my dogs as Little Hog and Picky Eater.  Sadly, Little Hog died in April and I only have Picky Eater now.  Little Hog would probably have liked these pretty well, but PE does not.  He is not fond of things that need a lot of chewing.  He also doesn't like raw meats and, frankly, this stuff does not look cooked to me.  It may be, but it doesn't look like it is and I wonder if that's part of the reason that he doesn't like it.  Also, the curly thing is weird.  I guess they were just trying for interesting textures that a dog would have a way to get his teeth around.  Flat treats are sometimes hard for pets to pick up.  But these treats are difficult for my dog to pick up.  They're just big enough that he can't get his somewhat small mouth around them.  He did eat a little on them but it was only after I pinched them up in smaller pieces.  So, if your dog likes to chew and isn't bothered by raw (or not cooked much) meat, he may like them a lot, so long as he likes chicken.  Otherwise, maybe not.  I gave it an extra star over my first choice of 3 stars, because some dogs would like this a lot better than mine did, and I took off a star from 5 because it just doesn't look cooked to me!

"Unfortunately there don't seem to be many choices in wireless doorbells. I love the sound from our Heath-Zenith unit (now ""Utilitech"") but the doorbell button doesn't seem to last more than a year, and they're becoming harder to find.Based on the good reviews, I ordered the Etekcity wireless doorbell. The unit itself is well-made, and the button is a nice modern departure from the standard designs. Etekcity advertises 1000 foot range, but that is only in open air. Silly claim - the point of a wireless doorbell is that the transmitter is outside of a building! Needless to say, the range seemed adequate.There are two major problems with this unit, however. The first led me to return it - the quality of the sound is really poor. There is no question that the standard two-tone doorbell is a cheap set of electronic notes. It just sounds terrible. I went through all of the remaining 51 choices and couldn't find one I liked. The problem is that a doorbell should be just that - a nice set of chimes. The other 51 choices are all tunes - who wants to hear musing playing when someone presses the doorbell button. Maybe I'm just old fashioned.My second concern is about the design of the wireless transmitter button. Although claimed to be designed for outdoor use, the screwdriver slot used to open and replace the battery is on the TOP of the button unit, leaving a gap where rain and moisture can come in.Needless to say, I returned the unit, very disappointed, and still searching for the right wireless doorbell.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8K8IV6YR7RVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRRFWA8#wasThisHelpful","R8K8IV6YR7RVV","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a tough review for me - there is a lot to like about the Mediasonic USB3 2-bay dock, including its throughput / performance, and cost/value. And while ultimately the performance swayed me to a more positive rating, the build quality leaves me questioning long-term reliability.First, the good news - performance. Tested using the USB3 connection on both a 2013 MacPro and a 2012 retina MacBook Pro, the Mediasonic dock performed faster than my Anker USB3 dock. I didn't have a chance to test a newer SATA6-based SSD, but with my SATA3-based OWC Mercury 480GB SSD I was able to sustain 254MB/s read and 223MB/s write. Both numbers are 10% faster than the same drive in my Anker USB3 dock. For spinning hard drives (both 2.5"" and 3.5""), the Mediasonic does not offer a notable improvement in performance over the Anker dock.In all configurations tested, over the course of 3 weeks, I did not experience reliability issues or random disconnects that others have reported. Both of my Macs were initially running OS X Yosemite, and were subsequently upgraded to El Capitan.As a dual-bay unit, the Mediasonic offers some unique capabilities, namely:-  the ability to mount two independent drives on your host computer when in ""PC"" mode- the ability to copy from one drive to another when in ""Clone"" modeThe clone mode is interesting, but finicky in my experience. I tried cloning a 500GB 2.5"" laptop drive to another 500GB drive, but the clone mode never moved beyond the first LED (25%). Because there are limited LEDs (a status indicator, and then 4 LEDs to indicate progress), there is no real way to check on why the clone failed. Mediasonic's documentation is quite clear that the target drive must be equal or greater in size to the source drive, and there are variations in capacity between drive manufacturers.I was successful in cloning a 3.5"" 1TB WD Black drive to a larger 3TB WD Green 3.5"" drive, taking about 2 hours and 11 minutes. This is faster than using Carbon Copy Cloner (Mac OS X) to clone between the drives (in PC mode with both drives mounted from the Mediasonic dock).Note that like other hardware ""clone"" devices, you will get an exact copy of the source drive, partition map and all. So if you're cloning from a smaller (eg. 1TB) to a larger (eg. 3TB) drive, it will mount as a 1TB drive. You will need to use a partitioning utility to increase the drive allocation. Software cloning utilities such as Carbon Copy Cloner (Mac OS X) and Acronis True Image Home (Windows) can adjust the size automatically during their clone process.What concerns me the most about this docking station is its build quality. The dock is flimsy - and the rear power switch didn't always work for me. Eventually, I learned how to press it slightly off-center to make it work all of the time. Not a good indicator of long-term reliability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0N6NLPBHJ9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115NB41E#wasThisHelpful","RL0N6NLPBHJ9T","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products you wish you had forever for vacuuming more difficult-to-reach or fine debris. - especially with the long flexible crevice tool that reaches difficult / impossible areas such as the gaps around car seats, tight spaces around heavy furniture, or even the inside lint trap of your clothes dryer.The HomeSource Detail Handy Kit provides 3 different vacuum cleaner attachments: - a LONG, thin, flexible crevice tool that reaches into thin gaps around car seats or even the lint trap of your clothes dryer- a wide scoop nozzle with microfiber strip for picking up fine particles like pet hair or lint- a dusting brush with firm bristles that don't easily wear under heavy useWhat makes this kit neat is that it is designed to fit most major light-duty vacuum cleaner brands (which come in 2 major diameters). The long crevice tool has two different opening sizes to accommodate, while there is an adapter connector for the other two nozzles.

"Excellent and clear sound, great value and build quality, but size limits useFirst of all, it is odd that NYNE sent a discontinued product (NYNE Bass Sport) for review. In fact, I couldn't find this particular model for sale anywhere outside of Costco. I called NYNE and spoke directly to a representative who explained that this was a limited ""promotional"" model that is identical to their NYNE Bass speaker. The only difference is the color (red vs grey endcaps), and the power plug (only includes US not other adapters). So, with that being said, I consider this a review of the current NYNE Bass portable speaker.As many have noticed, this is sold as a ""portable"" speaker, but it is definitely on the large side. At 13.5"" x 6"" it is not HUGE (like the B&W Zeppelin), but it is still not a speaker you can throw in your backpack or carry-on.Build quality is excellent and solid. NYNE indicates it is ""splash resistant"" but this is most definitely not a weatherproof or waterproof speaker system.Setup is easy - although the documentation is a ridiculous, poster-sized page of instructions in many different languages that is folded like a complex work of origami art.To pair, hold down the Bluetooth button on top of the unit, and it will enter discovery mode where it can be paired (without a key) on your Bluetooth-enabled device. If your device supports NFC for pairing, you can do that also. Although the documentation does not state this, NYNE support confirmed that the NYNE Bass will remember a ""virtually unlimited"" number of different paired Bluetooth devices, automatically pairing with the last connected device if it's available. VERY nice feature.The controls are large black rubber buttons, with embossed indicators, aligned along the top edge for controlling power on/off, volume on/off, bluetooth, and media playback (reverse, stop/play, forward). Without contrast color, even with the emboss, they are not easy to see in dimmer lighting. The power button on the top button illuminates white on power on, and changes color as you near end of battery life.There is a built-in microphone for speakerphone capability, although the range of the microphone isn't quite as far as other devices I've used.Sound quality is absolutely outstanding, and surprisingly well-balanced and accurate for a speaker in this price range. Despite the name, the bass is clear and tight but does not ""boom"" or color the sound image. There is a bass reflex port in the rear of the unit, and you can literally FEEL the air being pumped through it. I played a variety of music from dance / electronic to pop, vocal, jazz, classical, and never heard distortion even at the highest levels.Midrange is forward, and treble bright - perhaps a bit too bright for some instruments. If you like jazz, classical, vocal you will be thrilled with the sound accuracy. If you like heavy rock or electronic / dance you won't be disappointed with the sound either, but you may be used to more colored bass-heavy sound.There is a stereo mini-jack in the rear for direct aux sound input, but with my iPhone 6s and iPad Air 2, I actually found the sound BETTER quality via Bluetooth. In most systems, you will find Bluetooth noisy and inferior. As a strange side note, I also found the aux input much quieter (lower maximum volume) than the Bluetooth, even without sound limiting on the source device. NYNE support found this unusual but couldn't contradict the behavior.The rear of the case also offers a recessed handle, and a USB plug that can be used to power a device off the speaker's battery. There is also a power switch (different from the top switch) that completely powers off the unit saving battery if you're not going to use it for a period of time.So, why not 5 stars? This is clearly an excellent speaker at a great price. My issue is usability / size. For $50 more you can buy the Bose SoundLink Mini (which I also own), and although the sound in the NYNE Bass is definitely better it is not dramatically so. And the Bose SoundLink Mini is ridiculously small and portable to take with you on a trip, or in your backpack. If it were me, I would opt for the extra $50 and go for the Bose SoundLink Mini which also offers excellent (not quite as good) sound quality in a much more versatile package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DTKWZ3D3R1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R22DTKWZ3D3R1G","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it - in the electronic document landscape, Adobe's Acrobat format has become the ""Kleenex"" of document management. And while Adobe created the format, it has at times over the years provided little improvement year-over-year at a heavy cost. Enter Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, and you will find the first truly major upgrade to functionality and quality that Adobe has delivered in many years. And, at the same time, Adobe has confused the delivery model, offering standalone / perpetual licenses (the version reviewed here) as well as ongoing monthly subscriptions. The choices while more confusing also offer more value at a lower yearly cost.So what's new with this release? Quite a bit. Adobe has finally overhauled the core imaging / OCR / font engine to provide some truly breakthrough improvements in quality and accuracy. For scanned images, Acrobat now will recreate the native font outlines in its OCR process (buried in the ""Enhance"" area), although this does occasionally create some interesting editing artifacts. Flowing, multi-column text is handled much better than in previous releases. Form handling and recognition is much more accurate, especially across platforms. Exports from PDF to native formats (Microsoft Office, etc) are much more accurate and useful. Spell checking is finally included.With this release, Adobe also introduces a cloud platform DC short for Document Cloud for PDF sharing across devices and platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). If you have an existing Adobe cloud subscription (even a limited use one such as PhotoShop / Lightroom CC) you can access the Document Cloud for free (within your 20GB limit). This applies to both perpetual and monthly license versions of Acrobat / Acrobat Pro. However, today DC is only used by Adobe Acrobat and its associated desktop and mobile platforms. You can't share / save files to other cloud services (Amazon, Box, Dropbox, iCloud, Office365, etc). And even more confusingly, the Adobe Document Cloud is not viewable within the Creative Cloud documents.If you purchase the standalone / perpetual license you have no document signing capabilities. Adobe previously offered EchoSign for a monthly fee. That functionality has now been replaced by the monthly licenses of Acrobat DC or Acrobat Pro DC. If you purchase the standalone version (reviewed here) you have no electronic signature or workflow capability. Compared to Adobe's Photography bundle (Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC at $10/month), Acrobat Pro DC isn't a very good value. Acrobat DC is $13/month (paid annually) or $15/month for Acrobat Pro CC. If you need a lot of electronic signatures, the fee is worth it alone. On the other hand, if you don't need e-signatures, and you don't anticipate upgrading Acrobat every year, you may do better with a traditional perpetual license.What does the ""Pro"" version give you for an extra $200? (or $2/month subscription):- PDF file optimization (size / compression / version compatibility)- Redaction- Preflighting (checking document prior to professional press printing)- Bates numbering- Document Version ComparisonsFYI - For Windows users, this is the first release of Adobe Acrobat Pro that will NOT support Windows XP.In the ""one step back"" category, Adobe has attempted to ""simplify"" the user interface, replacing the traditional 3-panel (Tools, Fil&Sign, Comment) interface and replaced it with more of a touch-oriented set of icons and submenus. On one level, this highlights capabilities that were previously buried within various tabs. Adobe also lets you customize the toolbar from among the many functions. But, on the other hand, some common operations such as ""Recognize Text"" now become a 4-step process across multiple toolbars / ribbons that used to be 2 user interface clicks.All-in-all, this is a very solid upgrade, and for the first time in many years, one worthy of spending $$ to upgrade. The real / new question is how often you plan to upgrade Acrobat, and if you need electronic signatures. That alone may drive the value in a monthly subscription.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BB34ZZNAE284/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8XO98C#wasThisHelpful","R2BB34ZZNAE284","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Plus Guard Your ID Roller has a simple premise - a rolling ink applicator that applies a wide (just over an inch) circulating pattern of dark X's over any (non-glossy) surface. And while it may be better than nothing for things like pill bottles that aren't always easy to remove a label, it is far from the security of a paper shredder.The trick, as others have noted, is that holding the item at an angle clearly reveals the original text underneath on most surfaces. So for medium-security items (you're not going to have your identity stolen from a prescription bottle), this is ok. For higher-security items (financial statements, social security reports, taxes, credit card offers) you still need to use your cross-cut shredder.And, at $13+, with non-refillable ink, this is no bargain either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG29271RCYKOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFU1EJK#wasThisHelpful","RG29271RCYKOG","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a LOT to like about the SteamFast SF-295 3-in-1 Steam Mop. Very high-quality construction, easy-to-fill and fairly large (15 oz) tank, super-fast heat-up, strong, adjustable steam. Included are a number of attachments for floor cleaning (with 2 washable microfiber mats), clothes, fabric, even steel/grill cleaning. The adjustable metal handle is great for mopping, and includes storage lugs for the power cord.Steam is strong and even, with 7 adjustable levels. You have to wait for the steamer to heat up before you can change the steam level, however (this is not explained in the manual). Everything from low-level (1) for sealed hardwood floors to level (7). Somewhat annoying - you cannot actually see the level indicator when viewing off-angle.But for some reason, even with different steam strengths, using this for clothes steaming ends up leaving a lot of water drops. For most clothes this is ok, but for some fabrics you may be left with marks. And, the water is HOT and tends to drip on your hands as you steam.Minor annoyances - the cord is long, but not quite long enough for larger rooms. Definitely not as long as most vacuum cleaner cords.

"Let met start by saying that the Bose QuietComfort 20 in-hear noise canceling headphones are without a doubt the most COMFORTABLE pair of in-ear headphones I have ever owned. Bose includes 3 different ear sizes, and you should try all 3 for BOTH ears for best fit and sound isolation. My ears actually needed two different sizes.Given their overall performance at this price, I highly recommend them - assuming you don't mind the Bose ""signature sound"" profile, which is pleasing, but not necessarily accurate (aka flat).I am an audiophile - although not to the extreme of an ""audio fool"". My daily in-ear headphones are $500 Sure e535's which are in a class of their own - three drivers, super accurate (flat) sound profile, replaceable cables. Unlike the Bose, the Shure does not offer active noise cancellation, but with the right tip their noise isolation is excellent. And there is no comparison in sound quality - at more than twice the price of the Bose.Bose is popular for a reason. Just like the RCA ""Golden Throat"" design of the 1960's, Bose knows that most people prefer a sound profile that is clear, accentuated on the bass, and forward in the mid-range. And these headphones are no exception in that sound profile, although not quite as inaccurate as other Bose offerings. Treble is balanced but not necessarily ""bright"". On the other hand, there is very little distortion even at maximum listening levels (although you should note that maximum sound volume is lower on these earphones than some others).It's only when you compare in a-to-b tests against a true ""reference"" earphone like the Shure e535 that you will notice ""missing"" instruments that are drowned out by the Bose sound curve. Listen to vocals with orchestration such as Lana Del Ray's ""Born to Die"" or even The Dixie Chicks ""The Long Way Around"" and you'll discover just how dramatic the sound difference is. On Rene Fleming's ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" you'll notice the drum rolls are cloudy, bass is ""muddy"", and instruments like cymbals fade into the background.On the other hand, synthesized pop and electronic music sounds great and although not as clear as the reference headphones, this is a definite ""sweet spot"" for these Bose earphones.I've also found that battery life is much better than Bose's advertised 12 hours. This is good because the even though you can use them with the active noise isolation turned off, the sound quality is DRAMATICALLY worse, so you will want to have it on at all times. If you need to be aware of outside sounds, there is an ""Aware"" mode that lets more ambient noise through.In summary:>> Pros- super comfortable, no need to wrap earphone cable around ear- multiple ear size choices - try for both ears (mine differed)- surprisingly good sound, despite ""Bose signature"" sound profile remarkably clear mid-range, if not a bit too ""forward"" crisp and controlled, but slightly over-emphasized bass de-emphasized treble- outstanding battery life, way beyond the claimed 12-hoursCons- maximum volume level isn't as loud as other earphones should only be an issue for those already hard of hearing- dramatically worse sound quality when active noise circuit is off- white noise when noise circuit is turned on not noticeable in louder environments (eg. Airplanes)- lack of upper-end (treble) frequency response specs are not trustworthy (they don't indicate cutoff)- noise module is permanently connected near headphone plug- headphone cable is permanently attached (cannot be easily replaced)- Bass can be a bit muddyNotes- be careful changing ear plugs; twist the entire base don't grab the end","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205OZ8A9804EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9KV0HU#wasThisHelpful","R205OZ8A9804EJ","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Norton Security with Backup is the latest version of Symantec's trusted cross-platform security and utility suite (formerly known as Norton 360 Premier). This new release adds some solid features not present in its prior incarnation known as Norton 360 Premier, including support for 10 devices (Windows, Mac, Android), Identify Safe password management, an updated / simplified user interface, and the Norton Virus Protection Promise (which provides remote support for virus removal at no charge if the automatic engine can't remove an infection).And while I like the new features and the increased flexibility beyond the ""1-3 PCs"" offered in the prior Norton 360, my initial experience left a bad taste.First of all, even though this is essentially the latest version of Norton360 Premier, the install does NOT retain any prior subscription you may have. So unless you REALLY need the new features in this release or need to support more than 3 devices, wait until your existing Norton 360 subscription is near its end before upgrading to Norton Security.Secondly - and more concerning - is the stability of the installer. The first machine I tried to install this on was running the latest version of Windows 8.1 (with all latest Microsoft updates). The installer recognized a prior installation of Norton 360 Premier and proceeded to uninstall and reboot to continue. But on restart, Windows indicated it was attempting an ""Automatic Repair"". Ultimately, the Windows repairs FAILED - the error (0xC000021A) is a corruption of the Windows login files that could not be fixed by Automatic Repair, or even attempting to boot into Safe Mode. Lucky for me, I had a recent image backup of this Windows 8.1 install, although I suspect I could have tried to reinstall Windows 8 from the USB media.Speaking of Backups - once again, the Backup capabilities of Norton Security are very basic and file-based, ultimately tied to Norton's online backup services. You get 25GB of free storage but there is no ability to perform a Windows system backup like TrueImage and others offer (Norton used to offer Ghost but this capability has long since been removed from the suite). So while your files are protected, your system is not.Some may be surprised to see there is no CD or physical media - you are pointed to a URL (website) to enter your key and download the Norton setup program (a 1MB file), which you then launch for an additional (125MB) download of the actual product installer. Given that fewer devices are bundled with CD/DVD drives, I think this is a better approach - it always gives you the latest version of the installer and allows Norton to stay up-to-date with platform changes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC38M96UFDOOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV9ELBM#wasThisHelpful","RC38M96UFDOOI","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Brother Label Maker and in general I much prefer the Brother models to competing brands (eg. Epson). Brother's tapes are much easier to find and less expensive (often discounted). Even with the extra waste at the edges, the Brother ultimately costs less than the Epson.The Brother PTD400AD is a definite step-up from earlier entry-level models. I owned a PT1750 which has served me well for years. This new model is completely updated although not much larger than the previous generation. It's wider and shorter, allowing larger keys and more dedicated buttons including arrow keys, punctuation, Tab, and dedicated buttons for Font, Label, Frame, Symbol, Sample Labels, and Bar Codes. It prints about 50% faster than my old model and accepts thinner (3.5mm) tape (up to a maximum of 18mm). The display has multiple lines, and indicates format, font, and border. And with a memory, it remembers frequent phrases and labels.So what's not to like? The display is MUCH harder to read, even in good lighting. For all that this is a fantastic label printer, the display alone may be a deal-breaker for some especially if you have to use it on a daily basis.For $20 more, you can buy the PTD450 which has a backlit display, AND it has a USB connection for printing from your computer.Also note that this requires the newer ""TZe"" tapes. If you have an older ""TZ"" tape it will not work (and won't even load).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXULV8SIZZWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QI9M#wasThisHelpful","R3JXULV8SIZZWM","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While there are many good choices for inexpensive Bluetooth Heart Rate monitors, Wahoo Fitness differentiates with the addition of an accelerometer for motion and stride. And the companion Wahoo Fitness app really makes this device shine with stride analytics.The packaging is very minimalist - there is no manual, not even a setup guide, so if you want to get started you must download this (there is a QR code to scan if you want a quick link). I would have preferred at least some simple instructions. That being said, once you actually find the setup / pairing instructions, I found it to be reliable and easy. The chest band is very comfortable, lightweight and good quality. Unlike other HR monitors, the Wahoo includes activity LEDs to let you know it's actually powered on / available for pairing.I'm not a runner - I'm a heavy walker, so the run analytics are limited use for me. But I did like the ability to ""calibrate"" the device for treadmill use, so I can keep track of my stride and distance without relying on the phone's GPS like most other fitness apps do.All in all, the $30 (or so) premium over heartrate-only devices is worth it for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNWYL6JX26D1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLAGSW8#wasThisHelpful","RNWYL6JX26D1S","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Epson LabelWorks LW-600P is truly (for now) in a class of its own: a bluetooth-enabled label printer with apps for iOS (iPhone or iPad) and Android. That being said, after using it for a couple weeks, I'm really missing the convenience of a physical keyboard for those times you need to print of a quick label.First of all, the hardware. Epson has really designed a beautiful, compact, easy-to-load printer. Unlike many of Epson's standalone label printers, the tape is very easy to load, and it is easy to access the print head for cleaning if necessary. The unit operates on 6 AA batteries (not included) or AC power.There are some strange limitations, however:- Epson has chosen not to release Bluetooth print drivers for either Mac OS X or Windows. So, if you want to use the printer from your Mac or PC, you will have to use the physical USB cable (included), and manually download the drivers from Epson's website. For Mac OS X, you download ""Epson Label Editor Lite"" (free) from the OS X App Store. Not sure why it's called ""Lite"" because there is no ""FULL"" version by the way.- For Bluetooth, the printer does not support multiple simultaneous connections. So while you can pair it with multiple devices, only one device can be connected at a time. This is problematic in an office or small workgroup if you want to share the printer. Or even if you have an iPhone and an iPad. You must make sure the other device is disconnected, and then connect from the device you want to use.Epson offers many different label options, sizes, and colors, including some unusual ones (iron-on, glow-in-the-dark, even printed ribbon). Unlike the competing Brother TZ tapes, Epson's tape is generally not discounted, so you will pay 2x the price for a tape cartridge of roughly the same length. The extra cost is (mostly) offset by Epson's ability to print with much smaller margins than the Brother printers. My Brother PT-2730 wastes 1.25"" combined for every label I print manually. (If you print from a computer, the Brother is much closer to the Epson in margin savings.)The label printing software is quirky, but useful. You can easily add images from many categories (numbers, characters, images) or your own clip art. It is super-easy to create Barcodes or QR codes.- on iOS, the print preview is WYSIWG to size and scale, but it is NOT WYSIWG on Mac OS X (I would assume not on Windows either)- on iOS, Epson's ""auto cut"" feature really does calculate the end of the label and cut it for you (but it does not closely trim on Mac OS X)- on iOS, the interface is confusing and non-standard (click Left to insert an image?, want to remove an image? choose ""image alignment NONE"")- on iOS, the label preview function can use the camera to show what the label would like like on a physical item, but it isn't smart enough to preview with the actual label color (you can manually set the R/G/B color of the preview)- BIG PROBLEM on Mac OSX: despite many font choices, BOLD, font sizes, I could NEVER print a bold easy-to-read label (the labels always printed in lightweight fonts that are hard to read)In the end, after really putting this little printer to the test, I found myself wanting a physical keyboard. Unless you're putting together a complicated label, most of the time I find I just need to quickly type some text and print. With the Epson LW-600P, I have to fire up my iPhone or iPad, connect the bluetooth to the printer, fire up the iOS ""Epson iLabel"" software, type on the phone keyboard, and print.Considering how much more (3x) the LW-600P costs than a regular Epson label printer with a physical keyboard, I can't say I could recommend this unless your needs are different.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8ERI640675R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IL7BJMM#wasThisHelpful","R1S8ERI640675R","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been a big fan of the Sabrent all-metal USB 3 enclosures, so when it was time to house my 12.5mm drive (Seagate FreePlay 1.5TB), I chose this enclosure.Like the other Sabrent enclosures, the USB 3 interface is super-fast (reaching over 80MB/s read and write with the Seagate drive).However, the case design isn't so hot. The upper and lower metal plates are held in place by short metal tabs on one end, and 2 small screws on the other. The tabs aren't very deep, so I found that the plates easily pop off near the tabs.Worse yet - despite being advertised as a 12.5mm case housing, it can't quite fit my 12.mm Seagate drive. The lower plate is fine, but the upper plate is about 3mm too short. If you don't mind wrapping black electrical tape around the enclosure, it will at least house and protect a 12.mm drive. But not elegant or as advertised.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ST5JPV0CKL4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EIGUD4#wasThisHelpful","R1ST5JPV0CKL4N","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on many good reviews, I bought the Areca 8050T2 (Thunderbolt2 version). Unlike the Thunderbolt1 cabinet, the T2 is not being discounted right now, but I felt the investment was worth it for the performance. Boy am I pleased!Outfitted with 8 x 4TB Western Digital enterprise-class drives (7200rpm), formatted for RAID5, I'm actually getting BETTER speeds from the Areca array than the built-in PCIe SSD in my new 8-core MacPro (2013 version) - 1035 MB/s write and 975 MB/s read. For comparison, the built-in PCIe SSD gets 935MB/s write and 925 MB/s read. That's REALLY impressive especially given RAID5.If you're a fan of pretty light shows, the Areca won't disappoint either - especially during its (minute and a half) startup sequence. On the other hand, the LEDs are very bright which may be distracting to some people.My only complaints are with the fan noise. I guess I've been spoiled for too long from the built-in fans in my prior 2009 MacPro. Starting up, the Areca sounds like a wind tunnel, but after its startup is complete, the fan noise drops to acceptable levels. But any workload raises the fan to a noticeable (but not harsh) level. In my quiet office, this was enough for me to splurge on the Corning 10 meter optical Thunderbolt cable to relocate the unit to another room.But this brings up a final point that is critical for any RAID enclosure - power failure. Areca offers an optional battery backup unit for the 8050 (part number ARC-6120BA-T021) that you can order from their website for $150 (sometimes discounted). It doesn't keep the unit powered on, but it does protect the write cache for up to 72 hours. Without this backup, if you lose power during a critical write operation, it is possible to lose all data in certain striped RAID configurations (this is true of ANY RAID controller).Two final tips:1) the Firmware Update does not work with Safari, although every other configuration does. I ended up successfully updating the firmware with Firefox2) you MUST install the Areca Driver/Utility in order to use an Optical Thunderbolt cable","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39Z0YE0PON481/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOQ1LP0#wasThisHelpful","R39Z0YE0PON481","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATED: since I posted my review, Anker's amazing customer service reached out to me, offering to replace the unit. We actually went through two more units before finding one with a reliable eSATA connection. What is interesting - and is noted in the product specifications included with the unit - is that the eSATA connection is actually rated *SLOWER* (3gb/s) than the USB3 connection (5gb/s). So, I am now upgrading my review to a 4-star rating, as long as you have a USB3 port to properly leverage this dock's speed.First of all, it's tough to beat the price on this dock. And, I was very pleased with its USB3 performance (148MB/s write, 156MB/s read) with my 4TB Seagate Barracuda 5900rpm drive. That's impressive.  As long as you have a USB3 port to leverage the maximum speed, you can't beat this dock.  The eSATA port (which I had to go through 3 units to find one that worked reliably) is actually rated slower (3gb/s) than the USB3 connection.If there is any slight criticism of this unit, it is the non-hardened finish of the protective plastic door that is scratched the first time you insert a drive. But that is just a minor cosmetic issue.For some reason, it's not easy to find a good, reliable external drive dock these days. For almost 2 years my OWC Newer Technology Voyager Q dock was rock-solid through its eSATA and FireWire 800 connections. Based on reviews of that model and its super-high failure rates, I must have been lucky to have mine fail ""only"" 18 months into use, and outside the warranty replacement timeframe. Thinking that the issues would have been corrected, I ordered the latest (USB3/eSATA/Firewire800) of the Voyager Q only to find it dead-on-arrival with a completely non-working eSATA port.Enter the Anker USB3/eSATA docking station. For half the price of the Voyager Q you get a super-fast USB3 connection but no FireWire800 port for legacy Macs. But its price and reliability, combined with amazing customer service, are enough for me to rate this a must-buy as long as you have a USB3 port to leverage its speed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPHSQ5217NM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UA3I72#wasThisHelpful","RCPHSQ5217NM5","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There was so much to expect with Catch.44 - especially with the likes of Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker as leads. And while Forest especially provides a convincing, if not disturbing portrayal, ultimately the weak script doesn't provide enough leeway for even these seasoned actors to overcome.Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for that breakthrough moment where something deeper, more unusual emerged to bring the story tracks together. And, ultimately I was disappointed by a fairly simple plot, with a focus on high body counts and violence than any sort of depth of character. It's as if the filmmaker was trying to reach for a ""Pulp Fiction"" level of cult delivery, sadly missing in delivery.So, that being said, if you're looking for a high-body-count movie with the guys, some brilliance from Forest Whitaker's disturbing portrayal, and nothing more than go for Catch.44.

"Make no mistake, I *love* my iPhone - but the one thing I missed for work is the high-quality OEM leather belt holster that Blackberry offers. I've looked all around, and there simply isn't much choice for an iPhone belt holster. A few case makers offer bulky, clunky case+holster combinations, but unless you're an aircraft mechanic with a need for industrial-strength protection, these choices are just plain ugly and ungainly.I must say that this leather iPhone holster is a very good value, and surprisingly good quality leather and construction, with even a leather (not microfiber) lining. The oversized cover folds with a solid magnetic closure. It's also a good fit for my older iPhone 3GS with case and my new iPhone 4S. If your case is bulky, though, it probably won't fit this holster.What prevents me from giving this the full 5 stars is the clip design. First of all, it is hard-fastened so you are stuck with horizontal orientation on your belt. That may be more secure / reliable than pivoting designs, but I do like to have the choice.The more serious problem for me is that the clip is EXTREMELY tight. It is literally a fight every time to get it over my average-thickness dress belt. Again, this probably makes it secure, and the included belt loops (which you don't have to use) give the ultimate stability. But the tightness of the clip was a breaker for me.

"The first thing you notice with the Invicata Men's 1531 Subaqua collection chronograph watch is its storage case. Matte yellow, with an undulating design pattern on the top, it's a hint of the quality timepiece lurking within.And the 1531 Subaqua watch doesn't disappoint. The face is a stunning, 3-dimensional array of watch hands, sweep seconds, date, and count-down chronograph, surrounded by a matte-gold plated stainless surround with shiny numbers, a thick chrome body, and amazingly comfortable black silicone band. The crystal is made of Invicta's ""flame-fusion"" process, which creates a scratch-resistant and extremely easy-to-view (low reflection) surface. I'm not particularly confident in it's scratch-resistance compared to more premium sapphire crystals, but it makes for a stunning watch face.What you do have to be prepared for with this watch is its size. One word - MASSIVE. On my small wrists it looks plain stupid (it's about 1/2-an-inch thick), and at nearly a 1/2 a pound in weight I just didn't find it comfortable.On the other hand, my friend who has average-sized wrists simply LOVES this watch and the bold statement it makes.

"As a long-time owner of the Plantronics 975 in-ear headset, I was eager to try the Jabra Extreme2 with its promised noise cancellation features, and modern Bluetooth features (battery level, address book/voice dialing, multiuse).Perhaps I've been spoiled by the feather-light weight of my older Plantronics, but the first thing I noticed with the Jabra Extreme2 is that you can *really* feel the bulk of this on your ear. Jabra includes ""Ultimate Comfort Eargels"" to support in-ear wearing instead of the over-the-ear hook, but the bulk of the headset means it's not very stable in your ear. If you want to press the answer/end button, for example, you need to hold your fingers on the unit, then press. Not something very natural.The bigger problem for me was audio quality. When I switched between my 3-year-old Plantronics and the new Jabra Extreme2, people on the other side of the line complained that my voice sounded ""muffled"" like I was talking through a tissue. Their voices sounded fine to me, but even at the highest volume setting, it was still difficult to hear them in all environments. And, despite the promised noise cancellation technology - in wind outside, callers preferred my older Plantronics than this Jabra for background noise cancellation.It's a shame, because there's a lot to like with the Jabra Extreme 2. It supports the latest Bluetooth audio streaming (A2DP), can *simultaneously* connect to two different phones (VERY slick), voice-announces the callerID (if your phone supports it), and even shows the bluetooth battery level on your phone (again, if your phone supports it - my iPhone 4S does). Jabra even provides connectors for charging the unit through USB, 12-volt car, or A/C power. The A/C power cord, however, is ridiculously short (12 inches!) The unit also speaks connection status and battery level with a clear easy-to-understand female voice.On another positive note, I found the battery life to be outstanding (over 3.5 hours of talk time).In the end, the poor sound quality, low volume, and overall fit were deal-breakers for me. It's a shame, because the advanced connectivity, simultaneous 2-phone support, and battery life are outstanding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YC2D63B5F2ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G2U80O#wasThisHelpful","R1YC2D63B5F2ON","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was eager to try the Cyber Clean Shoe RX on my trusty pair of sneakers - which don't have a strong odor, but I figured would be perfect candidates to freshen-up.The product is interesting, as others have said. It's a gel-like blob that you form into the bottom of the shoe, and forward to the toe area, picking up debris along the way.While it did clean out some of the dirt down deep in the toes, I didn't really notice a significant improvement in the overall ""freshness"" of the shoes, despite the product claims.

"This small pack of 5 different ""eco-friendly"" cleaners is great to have in your car for that quick clean. With the exception of the leather cleaner, which did its job and no more but has a STRANGE smell, I was very pleased with the performance of the other cleaners.The Window cleaner in particular cleans without streaks, and doesn't require a large amount of fluid to do its job right the first pass. And that's good, because this isn't exactly the cheapest set of car cleaners, but you can buy refills in larger sizes.Likewise, the dash cleaner cleans with a matte no-shine finish without needing a lot of product.I only wish that, for this price, cleaning cloths would have been included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QD79TYB0VZV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G5FKO6#wasThisHelpful","R2QD79TYB0VZV8","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, X-ACTO has been the standard for utility and craft alike. Now, with its new Z Series, X-ACTO shows that you really can teach an old dog new tricks, with a super-sharp and VERY durable blade that lasts long after others have dulled.I put this knife through its paces, just as I would my classic X-ACTO. Cutting cardboard, opening boxes, trimming grout in the bathroom, and after 2 weeks the knife is still as sharp as it was when I started. I would have been on my 2nd or 3rd classic blade by now.If there is any complaint, and it is minor, the protective plastic cap doesn't fit very firmly, so I'm careful when taking it out to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284G5HOMMXIAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KRSWM6#wasThisHelpful","R284G5HOMMXIAE","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone who's ever wanted to find an individual outlet switch, you'll know that there aren't many to choose from, and what you generally do find is a clunky and two-pole (ungrounded) design.The Belkin F7C016q Conserve Power Switch is a refreshing design, providing a three-pole (grounded) switch at each outlet. Belkin's switch is small enough, that you can co-locate them, providing individual control for both outlets in a standard wall jack. And, a soft green light near the side switch indicates when it is turned on. This is a great option where you need a switch instead of unplugging all the time. For example, a Christmas tree (if you can reach the plug), or a power-hungry appliance.What is not clear, is the supposed ""up to $100 in annual savings"" from using this switch. Not every device has a power drain when plugged in (although many electronics do). And, it doesn't always make sense to unplug/turn-off every appliance. If you switch off your coffee maker, for example, you'll need to reset the clock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVFCZQRMNGQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MYN3OO#wasThisHelpful","REVFCZQRMNGQR","A2XPK6XCL0UH1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XPK6XCL0UH1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love devotionals, and Christmas devotionals are just special. I also greatly enjoyed Reverend Louie Giglio's other work, Indescribable. which I saw as a film. When I saw this book offered on Booklook (for bloggers) I was quick to request it. WAITING HERE FOR YOU lived up to its expectations. Interesting, engaging, and a great way to start the day.The devotions are short, easily read in less than five minutes. They include a verse, reflection on the verse, a poem or hymn to mediate on, and a prayer for us to pray. It isn't really deep, but isn't intended as a Bible study, but rather a moment with God.This book will be joining the other devotionals I'm keeping for reading during this advent season.  Highly recommended as a devotional for yourself -- and buy one for a gift as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVA037FDTKQVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718085086#wasThisHelpful","RVA037FDTKQVQ","ATFRPYKXCCTJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATFRPYKXCCTJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I enjoyed getting to know Morgan and Brady and getting reacquainted with the other team members who all interact in this close-knit group of friends who work together in one way or another.I thought this was too cut and dried -- at first -- as the book starts with her threatened death but the bad guy is quickly apprehended... But the stalking continues. Roses. Pictures. It is apparent that her stalker knows her well. And has an vendetta against her. Brady and the police as well as his friends work together to profile the stalker--but who is it? And will they figure it out before time runs out?If  you like romantic suspense, you will love Susan Sleeman's books. I couldn't put High-Caliber Holiday down and read it on a Sunday afternoon.

"Football is not something I'm drawn to, and if I were to judge a book by the cover, I'd likely choose not to read this book. It would be a mistake. Cassie and Reed are realistic characters with struggles most of us can identify with. Cassie has been badly hurt by a football star, and it is her worse nightmare when she's assigned a job working with them in her work-study assignment. Reed struggles with trying to be good enough to catch his parent's attention. He knows what he wants, but rules seem to work against him.I loved the main characters, but some of the secondary characters won my hearts just as much. Marquis, Hunter... I wanted more about them.  Derek vaguely reminded me of someone I know--thankfully not to the same extent...Candee Fick delivers an impeccable debut in this remarkable tale, filled with vivid storytelling. Catch of a Lifetime invites readers onto a journey of a lifetime as Cassie and Reed discover that even when they fumble the ball, or are getting blindsided in the red zone, the whistle hasn’t blown. The play is still alive, The Coach is on the sidelines, and His playbook is always available. This story is sure to score a touchdown with football fans and romance readers alike.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJ74JHRQ6CFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941103944#wasThisHelpful","R3VJ74JHRQ6CFX","ATFRPYKXCCTJX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATFRPYKXCCTJX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a charming Christmas story. Kind of slow and depressing at first as Judith is having a hard time coping with the empty nest. She has no life outside her family and now all of them were gone, ,except her husband. Stan and her best friend, Betty, try to cheer her up but nothing seems to help. Judith doesn't even want to decorate for Christmas and it's  her favorite holiday. Stan is at wit's end. He's trying to come up with brilliant ideas and plans to brighten Judith up, even helps her decorate, but no. Nothing. Not even a glimmer.There was so much I could relate to in this book.  The tradition. The time working moms and children don't have together anymore due to jobs and school (unlike those of us raised with stay-at-home moms).  The technology erasing family time. I think we can all point to a recent holiday when no one looked away from their smart phone or tablet.  Conversation? Gone. Kids playing outside? Gone. Everyone is too busy staring at a screen.I love Mr. Walsh's Christmas books (fell in love with him with his first, The Unfinished Gift, and highly recommend KEEPING CHRISTMAS.  So many wonderful Christmas stories out this year, and this is one of them.I absolutely loved Stan. I connected with Judith. This is a not to be missed story. And Mom?

"Okay, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea how to review this book!  It is very large, like a three-subject school notebook. Each page is lined, wide-ruled. It includes a joke (which my husband greatly enjoyed reading), words of wisdom (either by a well-known person like Ben Franklin or from the Bible), and a section called ""This is me"" which includes a thought or application or word of encouragement.Will this book cure an alcoholic?  Um, I doubt it. Will it encourage them along the way? I don't know. Will it give people chuckles when they read the jokes? Yes.  Will they enjoy the quotes? They should. What will they write in it?

"I generally love Ms. Wingate's stories and looked forward to this one. Ms. Wingate is a very very talented storyteller, making the story come to life. Her characters walk off the page and into life, becoming the person you see driving down the road, the stranger in the grocery store, the visitor in church.  But then they become more, they turn into friends, since it is written in first person, you know their thoughts, their concerns, their hurts, their plans...Everything.At times this story did seem to drag. It was slow, not a fast-pace edge of your seat book. It's one you can carry in the car and read a few pages at the DMV, a few pages at the dentist, a chapter during your lunch break or lulls at work, but not one that you'd spend the day devouring, burning dinner because you couldn't put it down.If you love Lisa Wingate's books, family sagas, or women's fiction give THE SEAKEEPER'S DAUGHTERS a try. You will want to read this series in order, The Story Keeper, and The Prayer Box, as well as some of the novellas (I absolutely LOVED the novellas)I hurt for Whtney, and cared what happened to her.

"This is not a CBA fiction, it is ABA, but DO YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA is clean fiction, sweet, without anything to give Christian readers pause.  It is totally cute, and I fell in love with Mandy and Jake. Belief is a bit suspended as a relationship is decided on belief in Santa or lack thereof, but that aside...Being a secular romance, there is no faith message as in faith in Jesus Christ. But that said, you could read between the lines and substitute Jesus for Santa. You have to approach Jesus with faith as a little child, as they so openly embrace Santa. You have to believe. Believe.  That was the message in this book. Believe.I greatly enjoyed DO YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA and was happy to get a copy on Netgalley for review.  This will be a Christmas classic.

"It fits the new model (2014) Dell Venue 8, but these are REALLY difficult to install -- plan on using up one protector just getting the hang of it. Much of the problem is the Dell tablet: It has almost no bezel on the sides of the screen. Thus, the screen protector wants to go right up to the edge of the glass, and if you position it just a tiny bit too far -- like 1/2 of a millimeter -- then it won't adhere, because it's running into the bezel. And if you try to lift it up to reposition, you're screwed: You'll get dust specks, fingerprints, smudges, etc. That's why I said, plan to burn one.

"Wow, I really don't understand all the hate re: this tablet. It's my fourth android tablet in two years, and I think it's a great value. It's reasonably fast, and the screen resolution is excellent. Most important -- and this is why I gave up my Asus Memo 8 in order to buy this Dell -- is that it comes almost entirely free of crapware.With Asus, and most android devices nowadays, you get a ton of apps that you'll never use; they take up space, hog resources, and you can't remove them unless you root your device (which voids all warranties and is only for the tech-savvy). The Dell is bloat-free: it comes with Dropbox, an internal browser, and very little else -- and that's exactly what I wanted. I want to choose *my* apps, not have some manufacturer in China decide for me.The only caution about this: Apparently Dell changed dimensions on the Venue 8, so when you're buying after-market accessories like screen protectors and cases, you have to be careful that you're buying for the *2014* model of the Venue 8. Unfortunately, Dell retained the same model number 3840 for both versions, new and old, so I ended up with (and returned) a couple of items that didn't perfectly fit this newer model of the Venue 8.Btw, there is a lot of bad info in these customer reviews, maybe because reviews of the old model are mixed in with the new one; I dunno. Here is a very complete review of this new-model Venue 8:  http://goo.gl/kcYN0qUpdate after 30 days: OK now I understand. The specs on this tablet are great for the price, especially since they updated the screen resolution on the new model. And I still like the fact that there is virtually zero bloatware. HOWEVER, there are serious problems with the browser -- and it doesn't matter if you're using the built-in browser or Chrome or another. The system will simply hang, for a very long time, with no way out. I've had a half-dozen different tablets, always using the same wifi connection, and this is the first one to behave this way. And because the main thing I do with my tablet is surf, it's unusable.

"The spray functions are great, and I really like the pause switch, but I cannot tolerate the NOISE these shower heads make. I can't figure out what causes it, because the loudness is the same on any spray mode. It's so loud that if I'm sleeping and my wife wants to shower, the sound of water pushing through these things will wake me up (and I'm a heavy sleeper). Our showers are fiberglass, and maybe that increases the noise, I don't know -- but three different brands of shower heads we've used in the past never put out the amount of noise that these do. Too bad, because I liked them otherwise. We're going back to our Niagra shower heads ( http://goo.gl/4ebKgv ), which work fine, cost less, and are blissfully quiet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8ZUL1VYMXE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUS0NA0#wasThisHelpful","R1D8ZUL1VYMXE2","A3AD8BSD82BMHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AD8BSD82BMHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The light from this is not what I'd call ""warm""; it's more on the ""cool"" side. But the bigger problem is that these bulbs have a slight startup delay -- about a second. I.e., when you flip the switch -- any switch, because I tried several different fixtures -- the light does not come on immediately. There's a very brief delay, of about one second, then they come on full power. I have not experienced this with other LED bulbs, notably the LE brand -- http://goo.gl/5U5va9 -- which I also bought from Amazon.

"The price I paid for this fan makes it hard to complain (I got it thru the warehouse deals at Amazon). It does move a lot of air, but the thermostat is not that great.

E.g., we have the thermostat set in the middle, so it comes on at around 90 degrees, but the fan will then keep running even when (in the evening) the room has cooled down to 70.

I probably voided the Weber warranty by doing so, but that's OK. The heat in this thing is very, very even throughout the grill, and it's very easy to control the temperature range -- I was surprised that it doesn't burn chicken to a crisp, like many small gas BBQs will.The only negative: I wanted the cheapest version without side shelves -- the BBQ is already on a table, so why do I need shelves? -- but this model does not come with a thermometer in the lid.

"Good, sturdy cover, fits the back of my GLK350 nicely. Lots of velcro on the underside that doesn't exactly adhere to the car's carpet, but it does keep the cover from sliding around.

"I ordered (via Amazon Prime) desert boots from Clarks, Nunn Bush, and Bass; these Bass were the clear winners. My shoe size is 9B, and the 9M in the Bass is a perfect fit for me. However, I can tell that they run a bit narrow -- so if you have a wider foot, you may not be happy.The reasons I chose Bass over the others:The overall construction is slightly stiffer in the toe and the sides, so the shoe feels more substantial and gives more ankle support. They aren't stiff, they're very comfortable; they just feel more like a shoe instead of a slipper.I like the styling of these -- the extra stitching along the top, and the contrast stitching along the top of the sole looks really classy, imho. I bought these for nights out in my tiny, funky town, so I didn't want something in the style family of my hiking boots.The arch and sole of the Bass felt (to me) more sturdy, more ""there"" than the others I tried.

"This is a great cover, especially for the price. The fact that it comes with a center support pole and a carrying bag makes the value even more impressive. My boat is 14' long on the center line, and the beam is 65"". I bought the smallest cover, for boats 14' to 16', and it fits great -- I have enough length left over to cover my outboard motor. This cover is rated to handle boats up to 79"" wide, and I think that is probably true *if* you don't use the center pole or have a windshield or console. But as you can see from my photos, on my little 65""-wide boat, with the center pole in place, I've got only about 4"" of cover coming over each side of the boat at the widest point. I do not intend to trailer my boat with the cover on, so I can't comment about that.

"Good LED, and the motion detector works as described. However, the photocell that is supposed to detect daylight is not sensitive enough. Viz., I have two of these, in bathrooms with windows. But the windows have shades, and I live in a pretty cloudy/rainy climate. I have the Danibos set on ""night,"" which means they're only supposed to come on when the room is dark. But in my situation, they come on most every day, unless we have really bright sunshine. I.e., they come on to provide light when I don't need any light. This isn't a catastrophic problem, obviously; it just means I'll burn through batteries faster than I'd like.The other issue, noted by another reviewer, is this: You should not rely on the foam tape alone if you are mounting this light on a surface that isn't perfect smooth. There are two keyhole slots in the back that you can use for hanging it on a vertical surface, and there are two round holes under the batteries that you can use for mounting on nearly any surface.

"Tremendous value, easy setup, good performance. At a new price of $130 (minimum), I'd consider this router to be a very fair deal. But at $80 for the refurbished version, it's a killer deal. Mine looked like brand-new, with protective plastic everywhere. Setup was a snap, and Netgear's Genie software is very well-designed and easy to use. This replaces a D-Link 868L, which I paid $140 for. The Netgear is just as fast, has better range, and is much, much easier to set up and maintain.UPDATE after 60 days:Everything I said above still stands: This router works flawlessly, no drop-offs, great range and speed. HOWEVER, a couple days ago I wanted to ask a tech support question. (My question isn't really critical; I'm just trying to figure out how to hide the Genie Media Server.)Well, it turns out you can't get anywhere with Netgear's customer support unless you have a 13-digit serial number, and the SN printed on the bottom of mine is 12 digits -- I assume this is because it is refurbished. I have sent multiple emails to Netgear, and gotten nothing but ""firewall"" responses: Where did you buy the product? What is the serial number? Etc. etc. And my email to the Amazon seller has gone unanswered after 2 days.So, I'm reducing the stars from 5 to 3. My router is working fine, and I'm very happy with the performance (and especially the price). But if I had a real, operation-critical support question, I'd be up the proverbial creek. I'm guessing this is *not* an issue with new products -- only the refurbished ones. Anyway, I'm pretty demanding about good customer support -- and Netgear is not delivering.UPDATE to my update:OK, I finally got someone from Netgear to respond, and they won't help me. Turns out their refurbished products come with only 30 days of basic technical support.

"A solid entry in the Deep Black series, ""Payback"" features the secret NSA team going to Peru to secretly unfix a fixed presidential election. Lia impersonates an elections consultant verifying the accuracy and honesty of the polls, while Charlie Dean and Tommy Karr sleuth around in unseen support of her.The Peruvian VP has the fix in, a deep enough fix that he's managed to have a few of the U.S.-made computer chips meant to control voting booths, altered to swing votes to him. The NSA can't tell the president, who is ill and about to step down, because if the election is delayed, he'll step down anyway, the VP will become president and then cancel the election altogether.Unknown to either the Peruvian presidency or the NSA, a third party plots. A popular general of Inca background is cleverly plotting to put his own man, currently running third, into the presidency. He fakes incidents discrediting both candidates running ahead of him.And he's got an ace in the hole: a nuclear warhead diverted from a shipment meant for terrorists but intercepted by authorities. How he plans to use it, though, differ from the secret plans of the crippled Russian  weapons expert and arms dealer who's been handling it - and building a dummy duplicate for him.What's great about this book is what's usually good about the series: the NSA team's James Bond electronics gadgetry and their ingenious ruses for using it. Lia and the boys get into scrapes and get out of them, all the while maintaining their cover as well as their electronic links to the NSA ""Art Room"" in Washington, who slice and dice the enormous amount of data at their command to give the field team leads where nothing else exists.I thought the setting refreshing also, a change from the usual plots involving jihadis, Russia or China. The general, descended from Inca royalty, wants to restore Inca culture and raise the status of those of Indian blood in the otherwise mestizo Spanish society.

"I've enjoyed David Downing's John Russell series, but this book is particularly fine. Historical novels set at the fall of Berlin in 1945 are particularly grabbing for me, because of the fatefulness of it all, and also because of its grayness. More on that later.For three books Downing dealt with John Russell's complex intrigues in prewar Nazi Germany. Now he has put together a series plot which allows him to look at Berlin's fall from three different perspectives simultaneously.Russell escapes Germany in the previous book, ""Stettin Station"", in 1941 after Pearl Harbor and America's entry into the war makes the Anglo-American journalist an enemy alien. A war correspondent since then, now in April 1945 he goes to Moscow on a dangerous long-shot bet - that he can cover the Red Army's entry into Berlin, ostensibly to write about it, but really because he wants to find girlfriend Effi Koenen. Russell doesn't know if she's alive but if so she'll be in danger when the city falls. The NKVD first jails him, then make him an offer he can't refuse - parachuting into Berlin with a spy team charged with bringing back Germany's atomic secrets. Russell's intimate familiarity with Berlin makes him a good guide.His son Paul Gehrts was a 14 year old Hitler Youth when Russell left. He's now in the Wehrmacht, and at 18, after a  year at the Eastern Front, a war-weary artilleryman trying to stay alive as his unit falls back towards Berlin. He's lost all his nave Hitler Youth gung-ho and idealism. He sees Nazism as the lie that it is, and its war effort a lost cause. His mother and stepfather are dead. So is his first love. He's angry at his father for having left.Effi Koenen, a onetime movie actress,  lives under assumed names and continues to do what she's been doing since Russell fled:  Helping Jews and others escape the country. She works  closely with a Swedish diplomat who gets them on ships to neutral Sweden. It's harrowing work: if any of her charges are caught and tortured, they will tell what they know of her to the Gestapo. She uses all her acting ability to disguise who she really is. As the Russians advance, she finds herself with a new charge - an 8-year-old Jewish orphan who has somehow managed to survive this long, and has no one else.So we're looking at this simultaneously from all three perspectives. Russell sees what's happened to the city he left more than three years before, and suspects his NKVD keepers will kill him once the mission is complete to keep their new secrets, secret. (And because, well, that's how the NKVD rolls.) He has no idea if Paul or Effi or any of his other former or almost relatives - his former brother in law Thomas, Effi's sister Zahra, Paul's mother Ilse - are still alive, or how to find them in a huge city now in ruins. Meanwhile the SS still roams its streets executing anyone deemed a deserter or traitor. Every decision he makes about where to go and how to get there - this subway station or that? this person's house or that? streets or rails or through the woods? - will affect whether he survives or not.Effi experiences the fall of Berlin as other civilians do. Most of the people left are women. Food is in increasingly short supply. Her real identity and Rosa's are still too dangerous to disclose to anyone. Every other building has been reduced to rubble by relentless Allied bombing and now Soviet shelling. Goebbels' propaganda machine still spreads propaganda about secret weapons, about a surprise peace deal bringing the US and Britain into the war against the Russians, about German armies poised to relieve Berlin, and a few people actually still believe it. Many people flee to the West towards Allied lines, knowing the Red Army will rape every German woman they can find.Paul, as his own unit is decimated and he finds himself without orders, must steer clear of insane SS types while still seeking to do his duty as a soldier - and wondering what, exactly, his duty now is.The odds for any of them - German soldier, German woman, Anglo-American journalist/spy - surviving this cataclysm are iffy.Downing keeps ratcheting up the tension, and the story moves fast as the net closes on Berlin. The reader knows each day brings the war significantly closer to its finish and its aftermath.  Russell, Paul and Effi and circle around in the dying city, and you wonder when and how they will finally meet one another.What makes this series great is its understanding of the shades of gray created by dual citizenship, by competing ideologies and dictatorships, by marriage, by blood, by familiarity. The beginners course on World War II is about good guys and bad guys. The advanced course gets into all the things blurring that.Like the Jewish informers still, in 1945, working for the Gestapo, walking the streets and fingering other Jews they recognize who are living in hiding.Or the American agreement not to enter Berlin. Is it to let the Red Army have its day after fighting the brunt of the war against the Nazis? Or is it to continuing letting them take most of the casualties, with the postwar lines of occupation already decided?  Are the Communists heroic anti-fascists and partisans, or part of a death machine as formidable as Hitler's? Amidst this all, individuals just try to survive.Russell is mostly English, a Tommy fighting in the trenches in World War I, but has U.S. citizenship through his mother. He was a Communist in the 1920s, but has long since walked away from that. Germany may be the home of the Nazis, but it's also home to those he loves, like Paul and Effi, and more widely to a city, Berlin, whose style, sophistication and sarcasm had always held it a bit apart from the Nazi ethos.And his circle embodies the pros and cons - former brother-in-law Thomas, whose business protects Jewish employees until well into the war; Effi's sister Zarah, her husband a fanatical Nazi to the end; Paul, whose heart is torn as a child by wanting to be as German and patriotic as his friends, while having a father who's a foreigner and quite skeptical of this whole Hitler thing.One vignette has Russell encounter a German Communist railway worker who helps hide him and a scientist on his spy team. Russell realizes what romantic and idealistic views the man holds about Communism - having been isolated from it, and the terror state it's become, for decades - and how disillusioned he'll become once seeing his beloved revolution in action.And while the liberation of some cities is overwhelmingly positive, the fall of Berlin is darkened by our knowledge of what will follow - the violence against helpless civilians, the rape of the women, a new dictatorship succeeding the old one, the gulags and POW camps in the East replacing the Nazi death camp system. Only the choice of victims will change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6RU8DG4K43V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EWEUK6#wasThisHelpful","RN6RU8DG4K43V","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Carroll admirably takes on a most difficult subject in this novel about postwar Rome: the Vatican's involvement with fleeing war criminals of the worst sort.And he touches on an even more explosive issue: the complicity of Roman Catholic clergy in the Holocaust itself.He brings to life a cast of fictional characters representing the many parties plotting and maneuvering in Rome - Americans civilian and military, British diplomats, Vatican Curia, Communist Partisans, escaping Nazis, Croatian fascists hiding out on Church property, the Haganah, fleeing Holocaust survivors, you name it.A high-ranking U.S. relief official has come to Rome to help send one shipload (there will never be another) of Jewish refugees to the States, and to find pathways of escape for Jews in Budapest, whom the Nazis are now sending to Auschwitz in wholesale numbers.  The book suggests how Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg was enabled to save 30,000 Hungarian Jews: the U.S. blackmailed Sweden, which had allowed German troops passage across the country and supplied Hitler with arms and iron ore. This would be officially ignored if it played ball on Wallenberg.Warburg must sort through the Vatican's confusing and conflicting record towards the Jews. It helped some while cozying up to their persecutors, but even its help is called into question once Warburg learns many were made to undergo baptism in order to find refuge. Accept the Cross or die, except that this is 1942, not 1542.Meanwhile, Marguerite D'Erasmo, a young Italian Red Cross official, herself a fugitive from the Nazis, witnesses an atrocity that changes her life irretrievably. She is drawn more closely to Jocko Lionni, an Italian survivor who coordinated the hiding of hundreds of other Jews.Kevin Deane, a deputy to powerful Cardinal Francis Spellman, arrives in Rome as his patron maneuvers to rise in the Curia, with the Americans now holding Europe's pursestrings and U.S. Catholic clergy well-positioned as power brokers. Deane becomes sensitized to the Jews' plight. He slowly begins to understand the anti-Semitism woven into his church's position on them, and even into his own attitudes.But Roberto Lehmann, another influential deputy - half Argentine, half German, serving a German cardinal - assumes a key position as Nazis seek to escape to Argentina with Vatican protection. The Vatican is interested in fighting Communism and reestablishing Catholic influence in Eastern Europe, and not at all interested in how much blood its new friends have on their hands, or the origin of their war loot. Some of the worst war criminals in Europe are believed to be hiding out in or around the Vatican.OSS officer Peter Mates starts plotting America's moves in the postwar - what will become the Cold War. The Communists are becoming enemies and thus their enemies, the Nazis, potential allies.Complicating everyone's game is the wild card of the Jewish underground, itself riven into factions between the left and right, the Haganah and the Irgun, which is variously helping refugess immigrate, legally or illegally, into Palestine; beginning to strike against the British who rule it in the cause of establishing a Jewish state; and hunting down war criminals to kill them, since the world apparently doesn't care much what they did.Carroll sees this from a largely Catholic perspective, making it far more interesting. It takes a Catholic to to understand the cross currents within the church - the many political threads plus the tenets of religious conscience that motivate, or fail to motivate, its leaders.Deane and Sister Thomas, a British nun with access to sensitive Vatican information,  are first stricken with remorse and guilt for what has been done to the Jews, but later recoil from Jewish terrorist strikes against the King David Hotel in Jerusalem - British military HQ there - and the British Embassy in Rome. Killing escaping Nazis is one thing, but attacking one of the principal Allies who fought the war against them?D'Erasmo, herself a Catholic, finds herself increasingly alienated from the church as she entangles herself in the lives of those she helps. She takes a fateful step away from it.Warburg, a secular Jew, can't ignore how little Washington is willing to help people in the direst need. He is effectively an agency of one. His War Refugee Board can't even include the word ""Jewish"" in its title, although it's clear Jews are by far the primary people in need of its help - countless numbers orphaned, wounded, starving, destitute, homeless, unable to return to hometowns where their neighbors turned them in or seized their property.  Warburg must do what he can - armtwisting, cajoling, dropping names, pulling rank, guilting - to gain even the smallest kinds of support.Carroll deals squarely with something the Church undoubtedly would rather have history forget - church complicity in the Holocaust in Croatia.This was not a question of turning a blind eye, remaining silent or being too cozy with persecutors, but one of priests leading death squads. Carroll focuses on one venue: the death camp for children at Sisak. The Church has never adequately addressed this exceedingly shameful episode in its history. Its obscurity has been sustained by various factors:Yugoslavia's relatively small Jewish population meant crimes there - and not by the SS, but by the less notorious (but equally vicious) Croatian Ustashe - haven't gotten the same attention that the huge concentration camps in Poland or the treatment of enormous Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe have. The beginning of the Cold War meant U.S. and British intelligence both saw ex-Nazis as potential allies against the Communists, knowledgeable about the new foe, and found Jews' calls for justice to be an annoying distraction.Croatia's fanatically loyal Catholicism meant that the Vatican let it get away with genocide as it maneuvered against the Serb monarchist Chetniks and the Communist Partisans for postwar position.And Communist ascension to Yugoslav power meant true information about atrocities there was tainted by the ultimate Communist goal of smashing Catholic influence throughout Eastern Europe. The Communists aren't who you go to for historical truth. Their own war crimes tribunals were kangaroo courts full of misinformation, in contrast to the Nuremberg tribunal's painstaking efforts to create a factual historical base in a public court of law.Carroll has done his homework, deriving the background for his fictional characters from some of the slowly accumulating major works in a field not yet adequately researched, including John Loftus and Mark Aaron's ""Unholy Trinity"", Susan Zuccotti's ""The Italians and the Holocaust"", Ruth Gruber's ""Haven"", and David Wyman's ""The Abandonment of the Jews"".His story takes note, via its omissions, of the gaps in the historical record: What Pope Pius XII's position on all this was - we see the maneuvering of key underlings, but he remains invisible - and how complicit the Curia and Croatia's Archbishop Stepinac were in bloodshed involving Franciscan priests under their authority.He sets the scene well in the Eternal City, with a great feeling for its many historical buildings, particularly the religious ones. And I like the interior lives he develops for his Catholic characters - priests and nuns with real feelings, not perfect, subject to human passions - and the difficulty they or any person of conscience must have had in trying to parse the innocence vs. guilt, justice vs. revenge, necessity vs. complicity, in those troubled times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWH4E3D3CFA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547738900#wasThisHelpful","R3TWH4E3D3CFA1","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flynn takes readers of this successful series back to Mitch Rapp’s roots – how he got started in the intelligence biz.Rapp, a star college athlete, is changed forever when his longtime girlfriend is killed in the midair bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 at Lockerbie, Scotland. And so he is amenable, shortly after college, when carefully approached by CIA recruiter Irene Kennedy to become, not just an agent, but an assassin.In the early 1990s, the CIA is reeling in Beirut, among other places –from the bombings and kidnappings that have claimed many of its agents, including station chief Bill Buckley, and from the burdensome Congressional oversight it now faces.CIA director Thomas Stansfield and Kennedy move to establish the proverbial “off-the-shelf” unit – one totally black, preferably self funded, and aimed squarely to putting fear back into the terrorists who lately have shown they haven’t got any where Americans are concerned.Leading training is legendary, aging and ornery CIA op Stan Hurley, who takes an instant dislike to the young and green Rapp, who has never even served in the military. He makes Rapp’s training a hell, and goes ballistic when on his first mission Rapp deviates from an elaborate and extensive plan to instead take out a target alone.What it’s hard for Hurley to realize is how similar to him in his prime Rapp is, a tremendous fighter with a great capacity for pain and an ability to calculate his every move and expression with the mission in mind.The two must go to Beirut to deal with a growing mess wherein an American businessman is being held hostage and a CIA agent sent to negotiate for him is himself kidnapped. Beirut’s fragile peace is holding but it’s still full of bombed out buildings and dominated by competing warlords beholden to different masters – Iran, Syria, Palestinian terror groups and a corrupt spymaster of the barely post-Soviet Russia.Rapp’s coolness all the way through his training and his first missions, and on into Beirut, makes him compelling. It's also a writing challenge to make an assassin a sympathetic character, but Flynn manages it. Hurley’s character is enjoyable not only in his rollicking non-PC attitude - smoking and drinking and whoring, oh my! - but in the way that fuses with him when he's in action. When he gets tortured in a Beirut basement – well, read it yourself, but I guarantee it’s unlike any torture scene you have previously read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PMD096C81FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UV8T9A#wasThisHelpful","R27PMD096C81FY","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like all the Jack Reacher books, and this one is no exception. Early in the series, Child does a good job, among other things, of laying more of the hero’s back story, particularly how and why he has chosen to live the way he lives – rootless, drifting, owning nothing and completely off the grid.Reacher is in Key West digging swimming pools and working as a stripjoint bouncer when a New York private detective looking for him – and Reacher hasn’t found out why – gets murdered.Heading back to New York, Reacher discovers the sleuth’s employer was none other than the daughter of his favorite commanding officer back in his MP days – the daughter he’d had a serious crush on when she was only a teenager.Jodie’s dad has just died, Reacher meets her at his funeral and then someone tries to kill them both, setting the action in gear. He finds his existential outlook challenged once he has someone to protect: Jodie.Behind it is loan shark Hook Hobie, who is both creepy – horribly disfigured – and  scary, and pursuing one of the bigger scores of his business life after getting a piece of a failing family business. We don’t know why he’s after Reacher and Jodie, and meanwhile Hobie worries he himself is being tracked in a mystery dating back decades.Child keeps you turning the pages relentlessly as he pulls slowly draws all these threads together.  Every element of a good thriller – action, back story, suspense, romance, cool and resourceful hero – he does well here. The climax, on the 88th floor of the then-still-standing World Trade Center, is a doozy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R113J4A0IZ5A9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FXK8XU#wasThisHelpful","R113J4A0IZ5A9E","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This engaging  mystery brings to life a Florida many of its residents will recognize, particularly those who follow politics or journalism.Janis Pearl Hawk (her mother was a big Joplin fan), a rising and hard-hitting columnist for a Bradenton paper, loses her job, but lands on her feet when wealthy friend Leah St. Clair hires her to be a `backpack journalist' - a blogger - focusing on environmental stories and on a candidate St. Clair thinks is the kind of governor the state needs.Hawk reconnects with a college journalism friend, Mercedes Westerfield, now campaigning for the candidate, Brad MacIntyre. Westerfield puts her on to a big story: that a big pharmaceutical company forced state researchers to bury findings showing their cancer drug more dangerous than a cheap and readily available alternative.Hawk meanwhile also pursues some other big stories: Attempts by a big gambling corporation to muscle its way into managing the state lottery, and a wildlife-destroying dredging project to increase shipping into Port Manatee near the mouth of Tampa Bay.Hawk has a lot on her plate. And then Westerfield is found dead. Hawk wants to stay on her stories, she wants to find out who did it, but then the threats begin.She's trying to figure out if a lobbyist has put a fix in with the statehouse speaker. Her ex-husband wants to get back together with her. Her well-meaning patron and a friendly state police contact try to get her out of Tallahassee to to protect her. And then she finds herself falling for the uncommonly environmentalist candidate, who wants her to work on his campaign. Will she be a campaigner or a journalist? She can't do both.This book is loaded with Florida history and flavor.  We follow Hawk to remarkable places like Wakulla Springs, where ""Tarzan"" movies were filmed, and the artist's colony at Sopchoppy. We get a helicopter ride over Crystal River's manatees. We go to Tallahassee, where the state legislature is in session, and any manner of skullduggery involving money, power and legislative votes is possible.Brunais' take on the state is a lot like Carl Hiaasen's, minus the latter's goofy humor and outrageously offbeat characters. (No roadkill-eating ex-governors here.)Both depict an explosively-growing state where bulldozers relentlessly clear more and more, with politicians complicit and a population largely unaware - or uncaring - about the long-term cost. The environmentalists are the heroes, trying to save a vanishing wild Florida and its rich biological heritage - and the developers and politicians and lobbyists are the heavies.There are many references to Florida politicians past and present - Charlie Crist, Rick Scott, Bill McBride, T.K. Wetherell, Walkin' Lawton Chiles, Bob Graham, Reuben Askew, Bob Martinez, Alex Sink and many more - lending the book realism and allowing Brunais to show off her deep experience as a Florida journalist. Anyone who has spent time in Florida will find characters and scenes they recognize on almost every page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KONVTQSBUTL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LASM2FM#wasThisHelpful","R1KONVTQSBUTL1","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two lead families of the Democratic Party hate each other. Edward Klein documents why and how in this entertaining and fast moving book. It's a good political beach read.It's mostly about three elections: that of 2008, where Barack Obama came from behind to knock off front-runner Hillary Clinton for the nomination, with charges and countercharges of race-card-playing in the South Carolina primary; 2012, where Bill Clinton made a whizbang nominating speech for someone he can't stand and Hillary drank the Kool-Aid in agreeing to lie about Benghazi - `it was a spontaneous riot caused by a video' - to seal Obama's reelection; and the 2016 election, where Obama promised Clinton he'd support Hillary in exchange for their carrying his water, then reneged on it.There are tons of details and fly-on-the-wall accounts of conversations. The Clintons come off much better than the Obamas do. We know most of the Clintons' dirt already and, as a nation, don't seem to care too much, but meanwhile they seem to have a clue about how to run the country, while the Obamas don't. Barack Obama comes off as narcissistic, lazy, and shielded from reality by advisor Valerie Jarrett, effectively the shadow president since 2009.I get the feeling the Clintons shrewdly used this book to get their version of events into play. Klein found leakers near the Obamas who are unhappy with them, but many Clinton sources appear to be lifelong friends seemingly given the green light to talk for this book - people who wouldn't jeopardize their relationship to do so. And for many of the quotations, there would be no question in the Clintons' minds who had given them - people party to conversations where only one or two others were present. So it stands to reason the anonymous sources don't mind the Clintons knowing.The Clintons, heavily covered for over 20 years, may realize there isn't much that can hurt them that hasn't already been printed. We all know about Monica, Clinton's womanizing, the financial scandals dating back to Arkansas days, Hillary's temper and so on. And a lot of the inside poop here is either flattering - Bill Clinton as political mastermind, say - or humanizing. It's remarkable that the Clintons stay together after all they've been through, but they seem politically fascinated with each other. And it's remarkable how many times Hillary initially tells Bill off about something, only to agree later that he's right and go ahead with it. Quite cute, say, is the anecdote about how Bill convinced Hillary to ""have some work done"" on her face after leaving the State Department, by first doing it himself.The new news is the medical stuff. Hillary's health problems have been more serious than generally noted.  And Bill's heart condition is serious; Klein quotes his doctor, by name, telling him the disease is progressive, i.e. it will continue to get steadily worse. Bill's obsession with sealing his own legacy by putting Hillary in the White House has become single-minded. It's suggested this is the primary thing he wants to get done before he dies.The Obamas seem more on the defensive and more paranoid. You don't get any sense of Klein's sources spinning the narrative back in their direction. Barack comes across as a narcissist stemming from a deepset insecurity about his lack of experience pre-presidency. He's someone who doesn't read much beyond popular novels but thinks he's brilliant. He's visibly bored with the dull business of running the country. He doesn't prepare in advance for big international conferences, who he'll meet and what they'll talk about; he figures he'll just wing it. Detractors (like Hillary) call his administration ""rudderless"".He's threatened by Bill Clinton, who not only isn't intimidated by him but tries to lecture him. (There's a priceless account of a dinner between the two couples - the strained conversations, Obama ignoring Clinton by reading his Blackberry under the table, Obama sneaking out and coming back a while later smelling of cigarettes.) He's shielded from much by Valerie Jarrett, who surrounds him with sycophants and upon whom he relies too much. She has her own room in the presidential quarters and is the only outsider who eats with the family. He thinks he can move the world with his speeches.You see Obama good at campaigning and manipulating, but not much else. Michelle more or less invites herself and friends to Oprah Winfrey's Hawaii estate for a joint birthday party, in part to draw her back into the Obamas' camp and keep her out of Hillary's. The weeklong stay goes fine, but Oprah resists any political rapprochement, and even starts promoting Hillary not long afterwards.Obama picks Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg (a third Democratic family as powerful as the Obamas or Clintons) as ambassador to Japan, a way-too-late thanks for Kennedy family support in 2008 - and, apparently, just to get her halfway around the world from Hillary's candidacy.It amazes me that the Obamas would work this hard to undermine their own party's frontrunner for the 2016 nomination. The Clintons will have raised a billion dollars for the run.There's lots of dirt about both couples. Bill still womanizes intensively; you wonder if he'll die `in the saddle' like Nelson Rockefeller did. A guy with a bad heart condition?His penthouse over the Clinton Library in Little Rock is his bachelor pad - Hillary avoids Little Rock - and effectively the Playboy Mansion South, the scene of many swinging parties. Klein suggests that the town not only shields its favorite son from scrutiny, but that its women, married and single alike, line up to sleep with him. Klein quotes one person saying Clinton will hit on married women even in front of their own husbands. (You'd think in Arkansas this would get a man shot, but then most other men there don't enjoy lifelong Secret Service protection.) He and Hillary lead separate lives, talking daily on the phone but rarely in each other's presence, and Hillary tells friends he'll have little presence in her White House should she be elected.Klein notes some presidential couples become closer in the White House, where they finally have physical proximity after years of separation on the campaign trail, but this didn't happen with the Obamas, who are effectively estranged. Michelle Obama, of whom White House staffers are terrified, will burst in suddenly on her husband if he's in a room with other women; she's suspicious of him, believing he'd like to emulate Clinton's ways. Her post-White House plans, according to this book, don't include him. She and Valerie Jarrett, who plans to follow her, envision a high life of globetrotting funded by wealthy donors where they sit on corporate boards and don't have to do much work.Barack Obama wants to retain control of the party, but Bill Clinton already sees him losing his clout and political capital.The real question mark goes back to Bill Clinton's health. If he dies - a guy with this bad a heart condition? Waitresses and Little Rock matrons, think about it - some think Hillary, relying upon his advice forever, may not go ahead with a presidential run. It often sounds like more his obsession than hers, other than the first-woman-president thing. The family foundation's reins have been handed to Chelsea, in part to take pressure off Bill, and she is being positioned as his replacement as Mom's closest advisor and confidante. Others think Chelsea would encourage her mother to run if Bill dies because it's what he would have wanted. You get the feeling that Hillary, for all her ambition, doesn't have all that much fire in the belly - that it's Bill who's given her the vision, encouraged her, pushed her, made her see a path through obstacles, and been willing to fight battles large and small where she would have been more inclined to go along, get along and acquiesce.Truly surreal is the ending. Bill tells an appalled Hillary, in front of friends, exactly how to stage his funeral if he dies before the election: what to wear (widow's weeds), where to do it (Arlington, he's a former commander in chief.) If properly done, he said, the video footage will be worth a couple of million votes."" Not for nothing do they call him the smartest political mind of his time.PS The day before I filed this, I saw a story online at Business Insider quoting an unnamed Clinton confidante attacking this book as lies, all lies, nothing but lies. The story didn't specifically rebut anything or cite any specific error in the book; it reprised a finding of an error in one of Klein's previous books. It suggests to me, though, this book is right, if the attack against it is as unspecific as ""lies, lies, nothing but lies."" Perhaps the Clinton camp is doing some preventive public fulminating so that  they can deny the unflattering or unfavorable parts of it. I still think they planted a lot of this.The same day, the Wall Street Journal had a front page story about Hillary distancing herself from the Obama administration. This is exactly what the book says she would do - it's half revenge, and half good politics, as seen by Bill Clinton, with the Obama administration in a tailspin on any number of fronts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UDYKIT2AJR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFOGOOM#wasThisHelpful","R28UDYKIT2AJR5","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some reviewers contend the main character of this book is the city of Shanghai itself, but I disagree. Aw goes to great lengths to develop five main characters whose paths slowly begin to cross in the present day, some having crossed or skirted each other before.The book takes about a hundred pages to get going. The characters are mostly overseas Chinese from Malaysia, people who have come to Shanghai to make their fortune. Shanghai is seen from these outlanders’ eyes – a cold and fast-moving place where everyone is on the make, where deception and posturing are the norm. An American comparison might be those who come to New York City to succeed or escape.What comes across to me most of all is an overwhelming sense of alienation. Our characters all have failure in their backgrounds, or teeter on its brink today, or both.Phoebe is an illegal immigrant who comes to China for a job that has vanished by the time she arrives. She makes her way to Shanghai determined to build herself up from nothing by reinventing herself, right down to a stolen identity she adopts. She has worked as a bar girl and a factory worker but is determined to do better, and one of her tips on how to do this is a self-help book. She believes in falsifying nearly every aspect of herself to present the images she thinks will lead to success and conceal her hard-scrabble upbringing and lack of education.Justin is the heir to a real estate fortune, the family representative sent to Shanghai to further their enterprise into the next generation. Suddenly, their wealth collapses and he plunges into a funk. Gone are his friends, his family – but also the crushing sense of obligation under which he has labored all his life.Gary is a pop singer from a desperate rural past who wins a TV talent show, launching him into a frenzied pop stardom. He begins to deteriorate as stardom takes its toll, and suddenly a bad incident and negative publicity destroy his career. He, too, becomes mired in depression. The only solace he can find for months are his chats with a girl on the Internet.Yinghui is a self-made business success, a woman who owns fashionable clothing stores. Driven, hard-working, totally obsessed with her business existence, she has no personal life. Lurking behind her is the disappointment of a failed romance during an idealistic and pampered youth, and the scandal which destroyed her family fortunes.Walter is a billionaire who likes, when not swinging some huge deal or another, to lecture on how to find success. And he found it the hard way; we learn just how difficult his own youth was. He yearns for intimacy, but seems incapable of it.All these people are essentially lonely, and Shanghai does little to alleviate that. They must ask themselves – is life better where I came from? Would a return to the provinces be a failure, or are dreams of big-city success themselves a complete illusion?Their world is poised precariously between yesterday’s traditional Asian society,  the one their parents were born into,  and today’s impersonal, ruthless world, one of cellphones and online dating, of fleeting relationships and acquaintances, of fortunes made or lost in huge development deals that create and destroy. China and surrounding nations like Malaysia have been rapidly industrializing, hotbeds of growth and corruption, during our characters’ entire lives.Our characters have little dialogue, in part because they have so few people to talk to that they trust. Their passages mostly remain in their own trains of thought, reflecting upon their joyless existences.Americans will find this book penetrating not only in its plot and characters, but in its insights in what it means to be Asian in the early 21st century.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWKB0SSQ10WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994345#wasThisHelpful","R1PWKB0SSQ10WO","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought, when I saw this book's description, that it sounded a lot like Cracked.com, a website my son turned me on to. There's a good reason for that: the author is one of the website's editors.Cracked.com specializes in fact-based (albeit the facts heavily stretched) articles about things retold as one teenage kid might tell it to another. And that's what this book is. If you're a teenage kid, and you're talking about the presidents, it's not at all unlikely that you are concerned with this question: Who, among them, was the biggest bad-ass?The author, and my son, think Teddy Roosevelt was, and his chapter in this book makes a decent case why. This is a guy who punched out a cowboy pointing two guns at him; a guy who proceeded to give a 90 minute speech after an assassin put a bullet in his chest but failed to kill him.The book is a fun read in the way a Ripley's Believe It or Not book is, or was. Things are joyously hyped, tons of stuff is left out, it's not authoritative or balanced or serious nor does it pretend to be, but there is enough of a core of truth to make it a not horrible way to get the teenager in your life to read some history.It's fairly risque. The author is fascinated by LBJ's unique habits of showing people the body part he called ""Jumbo""; going to the toilet in front of them to emphasize their subordination to him; and once urinating on the leg of a Secret Service agent who got in his way.Kennedy's sex life gets a good workout, of course - as does his PT-109 exploit, in which he towed an injured shipmate miles through the sea by a strap held in his teeth.Washington leaves the author in awe: he plunged into battle often, getting bullet holes in his clothing while convinced nothing could kill him. The author falsely suggests that Washington, in some nearly mystical way, moved the Continental Congress to war by showing up in uniform at a time when most of them hadn't yet accepted the necessity for it. (Washington badly needed the job and it carried a fair amount of prestige; he wore the uniform to remind them who he was.) He also makes a bit too much of Washington's lack of qualifications to be a commanding general; he's been a mid-level officer in the French and Indian Wars, and it's not like the colonies had a whole lot of British generals at their disposal.But the author also finds admirable traits in presidents who weren't soldiers or fighters. John Adams proved his cojones, in the author's eyes, by not only representing the five British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre, whom the city was ready to lynch, but by getting them off. Adams was a fierce debater, preferred verbal combat, and didn't care who liked him.Jefferson gets kudos for sending the Navy and Marines overseas to fight the Barbary Pirates - the nation's first overseas war, asserting the nation would no longer pay extortion tribute - and telling Congress about it afterwards.James Madison was a hundred-pound pipsqueak, but was the only president to fight while in office, firing two handguns at the British during the War of 1812 when they sit his house on fire.The book's title premise is pretty silly: that you're getting all this information so that you can decide how to best fight him. Like if you have to fight Jimmy out by the flagpole after school, and consult Ralphy how best to take him. Fortunately, O'Brien doesn't waste too much time on this, and saves most of it for the presidential anecdotes.So who do I think was the all-time bad-ass president? Andrew Jackson, and the book makes, in my opinion, an even better case for him than for Teddy Roosevelt. He fought 13 duels - that we know of, there were probably more - facing death each time and inflicting it most of those times. When nearly 70, he nearly beat to death, with his cane, an assassin whose gun misfired (twice) while pointed at Jackson. (And a little later fired perfectly.) While only 13, he'd fought for the Revolution and escaped English captivity by running barefoot 40 miles. While also suffering from starvation and smallpox. (This is why you want rednecks in the U.S. Army.)It's the stuff of Chuck Norris. 'Nuff said.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6H9ZXUQZVTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038534757X#wasThisHelpful","R3K6H9ZXUQZVTX","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two kinds of spy novels. There’s the American spy novel, which emphasizes the latest technology and what can be done with it. And there’s the British spy novel, emphasizing the human element – the burned-out agent, the one who no longer trusts his superiors, the double agent, the mole, British class snobbery, and a lot of really good tradecraft.This novel doesn’t manage to be either. It drags, terribly. This is the third installment of Dryden’s series featuring Anna Resnikov, a high-ranking Russian spy who defects to the West as the Russkies kill her MI-6 agent lover. She now works for a large and powerful American private intelligence firm called Cougar.Herein lies the rub. Cougar seems far more powerful than any such firm would ever get. It virtually dictates to the CIA. It has apparently bottomless resources. Fleets of planes, yachts, a mini-sub.Resnikov is beautiful (of course), whip smart, always the one who sees the real deal when others miss it, and a great spy, but I find her strangely unengaging. She is consumed by the desire to work against Russia now, and again and again volunteers for missions where she’ll put herself, alone, in the Russians’ gunsights, on or close to their turf. The author works hard to make this plausible, but I just don’t see it.Resnikov is humanized by her struggle to keep her small son safe. She’s now turned him over to another couple to raise, and the sense of loss she feels at not being able to raise him is poignant. It’s Dryden’s effort to humanize her, to show not even she is Superwoman.But otherwise, she doesn’t grab me. Her tradecraft is OK but not intriguing. She seems rather bloodless – flawless in action, but not exciting or interesting. You don’t sense her working up a sweat or suffering any internal turmoil even when she kills people.The novel doesn’t bring the hardware. Cougar head Burt Miller is all-powerful but not really interesting despite the author’s efforts to show him as rich and a little eccentric, puffing on cigars, wearing flamboyant clothes, telling outrageous tall tales and so on. It comes off like a spy version of Charlie’s Angels – rich guy, beautiful op – although I’m sure this is the last thing Dryden intended. (I think Dryden, as a Brit, may have some trouble writing Americans who are three dimensional. I’m also wondering if the pseudonymous Dryden, if indeed male, may have trouble writing a woman as the central character.)I also had trouble with the plot. Cougar gets wind of revived Russian efforts to destabilize Ukraine in order to ultimately reincorporate it. The French are sucking up to the Russians for trade and oil reasons. The CIA is jealous of Cougar’s power. The Ukraine, undergoing a presidential election, is torn between pro-Russian and pro-independence factions.Meanwhile the Russians are using a very special spy – Balthasar, a Muslim, half-Russian, who is blind but so extraordinarly sensitive as to compensate for his sightlessness. This includes reading minds and being so capable he can work as a field agent. I rolled my eyeballs at this. Balthasar moves around far too easily for a blind person.And the book drags. It took me two or three weeks to read, damning for a spy novel. That’s too bad, because I thought its Ukrainian setting worthwhile and timely – and Anna Resnikov a reasonable stab at a female spy character. Some of the characters’ musings are reasonably subtle or wise.But Dryden spends a little too much time on their interior dialogue, particularly troubled troubled ex-CIA agent Logan. One writing maxim is “show, don’t tell”.  You want to show someone being troubled and what’s eating him in a few deft strokes, rather than spend pages on his thought stream.And even the ending, suitably large scale, fails miserably on the plausibility spectrum. I don’t expect spy novels, of course, to conform to reality, but we see Resnikov perform a series of major actions, improvised in a short period, without any explanation of the preparation, training or inside knowledge that would have been reasonably needed for it. A good spy novel would have the whiz-bang ending, with much more explanation on how they actually pulled it off, and the only unbelievable part the clockwork-like perfection of something so audacious. That only happens in spy novels.Another way you might divide spy novels is between the best ones – well-written, subtle, absorbing, educational – and the mass-market ones, sensational but hokey. I thought this series wants to be seen in the former group, but this installment slips towards the latter one.  The powerful billionaire with his private army who tells presidents what to do, and his gorgeous babe agent? And it still can’t manage to be a page-turner? The first couple of books were better than this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QBXM95EAJHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PMWLV4#wasThisHelpful","R13QBXM95EAJHQ","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tom Wolfe may never get his historical due for his continuing refusal to get with the program. Today's fiction market is overwhelmingly aimed at women, who make up as much as 80 percent of the market. Tom Wolfe is a man writing often about a taboo subject - manhood. Maybe that's why this book has sold so poorly, and why I didn't even hear about it until more than a year after its publication.Hopefully, one day, people will recognize he is our time's Charles Dickens, whose voluminous works chronicle a certain era like none other. Wolfe has never stopped being a journalist. Novels provide a less controversial medium for him to use his stream of consciousness technique for his characters; used in non-fiction, it left its author open to attack: `How do you know what Gus Grissom was thinking?'  Whether in fiction or non-fiction, though, his technique always has had a certain credibility because of the depth of his research and his insight into human nature - his ability to see people as Everyman, acknowledge how the world looks from Everyman's eyes, and sense how Everyman gets through his day.Wolfe's characters have a certain flatness to them, but it's a graphic-novel flatness, rich in detail, exaggerations intended. While spending an enormous amount of time inside their heads, he devotes little time to their back stories, a rebellion against a Freudian view of the human condition. Wolfe's characters don't dwell on yesterday, their childhoods, or long ago. They're not deeply conflicted. They are hard-working folks making their way up in life, people from small-town or working-class backgrounds confronted with the foibles and pretensions of modern life, executives with big mortgages and kids in private schools who worry about losing it all if they make the wrong move. They don't see psychiatrists.What they think about is the intense experience of Now: What they've got to do today. How it will help them climb the ladder or bolster their position on it. Who they're in love with, or in heat for. What it looks like out in the street or at the chic restaurant or hot soiree or dingy crack house - right now, in riotous detail. If today goes right, they feel good. If not, they feel lousy.There's much here familiar from previous books. Wolfe remains fascinated with art, design and fashion, of course: what status it conveys, what it connotes and to whom. There's his sense that we're preoccupied with the race, class, sex or walk of life we come from - in Miami, the Cubans, the blacks, the Haitians, the Russians, Miami's vanishing tribe of WASPs, and more - and he's determined to set it forth as exactly and convincingly as he can. A racial incident hyped by the media knocks a character for a loop, as in ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""A Man in Full"". His over-the-top writing style, with its sound effects and run-on sentences and orgies of gorgeous words, is, if anything, amplified in this book from previous ones. (Some expressions like ""buttery jowls"" and ""loamy loins"" seem like old friends now.) He focuses on male strength and manhood, often symbolized by the strength of a man's hands, to do work (Charlotte Simmons' father), protect himself (Conrad Hensley in ""A Man in Full"") or commit some manly act of courage.That last type of incident kicks off this book. It focuses on two Cuban-American characters in Miami: young police officer Nestor Camacho, and his estranged girlfriend Magdalena Otero. Many names in this book can be mined productively: the macho Camacho; Otero the ""other"", witness to but not part of the alien and decadent lives of the rich; the egotistical Cuban mayor Dio who thinks he's God.Nestor commits a startling act of heroism and strength, rescuing a panicked refugee from the top of a sailing mast. Televised, he becomes a momentary hero but a pariah in the Cuban community for stymieing a fellow refugee's flight to freedom.Magdalena meanwhile ditches him for unrelated reasons. A nurse, she's taken up with her boss, a wealthy, celebrity psychiatrist whose specialty of porn addiction gets him regularly on TV. Through her eyes Wolfe gives us his take on sexually unhinged modern life with the pervasiveness of pornography, ever more public acts of sex and nudity, and an orgy among the well-connected at a regatta. Only slowly does Magdalena realize her own boss is sex-addicted himself, and also exploiting his richest client's dependence upon him to get entree into his social circles. Wolfe has frequently written about sex in modern life, but here he chronicles ever-darker lows, symbolized by the billionaire porn addict's revolting STD symptoms.To live in luxury with her boss, Magdalena leaves Hialeah's suffocating Cuban embrace. Nestor is expelled from it. His plight deepens when his take-down of an enormous and violent crack dealer turns into a racial incident broadcast on YouTube, leading to his suspension from the police force. He falls in with an ambitious young Miami Herald reporter investigating rumors that a wealthy Russian philanthropist may have committed a monumental fraud. Camacho has been abandoned by everyone around him - the police force, his family, his girlfriend - but never abandons devotion to his duty.The work has some flaws. It ends abruptly. Wolfe's style, particularly the run-on sound effects, can become tedious, and if cut by a third would still get the message across. I have never understood what passages set off by ::::::::::::  connote. Wolfe started using it long ago, but I've never gotten what, exactly, differentiates these passages from the rest of the consciousness flow.And I don't understand the title, unless it suggest Miami is incurably tribal. The ending hints, ever so faintly, otherwise. There might be some rays of hope.But Wolfe's insights into food, language, status, wealth and style are, as ever, dead on, and deeply revealing. And depressing. There is vanishingly little sense that among the upper crust, much style or dignity or human value at all survive amid all that money. A scene of slovenly billionaires stampeding through the Miami Basel art convention in search of deals, seems much like K-Mart shoppers hurrying to a blue light special - but with more vulgarity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUL4R4TNPQ61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076DCLVU#wasThisHelpful","R3RUL4R4TNPQ61","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not one of my favorite Deep Black books. The story is workmanlike but doesn’t have a lot of life to it. I thought it was predictable and dragged a bit. As other reviewers have observed, the decision to kill off Tommy Karr in an earlier installment was a bad one. He was an interesting character and created an asymmetrical three-person team in the field. Too much weight is thus placed on the relationship between Charlie Dean and Lia DeFrancesca, but it’s not that interesting, and in any case the two are kept apart in the field by superiors aware of their romance.I also don’t like this book, though, because it uses the scenario of nuclear terrorism in the Canary Islands to trigger a tsunami destroying the American East Coast. One of Patrick Robinson’s books had the same plot. To their credit, Coonts and DiFelice note that this particular doomsday scenario gained traction in popular culture stemming from a BBC what-if documentary in the early 2000s, and then the ensuing 2012 Mayan-calendar end-of-the-world craze.I concede that there are only so many contemporary plots for thrillers – the usual bad guys, jihadis, Russian nationalists and Chinese spooks; the usual atomic weapons, the usual illegal obtaining of them from loosely guarded Russian stockpiles or easily bribed officials. But to me it felt hokey, nonetheless. It was more of a Clive Cussler plot than a Stephen Coonts one, and in Cussler’s hands such stories are more clearly fun and escapist.It wasn’t just the plotting. The Chinese business executive who is actually a Chinese intelligence major is a bwa-ha-ha Oriental bad guy straight out of a 1930s B film.  The evil Feng! The mandatory cliffhanger torture session with our damsel in distress (well, OK, DeFrancesca isn’t exactly helpless) also had a hokey feel to it.A couple of new Deep Black members have been brought to the fore. But while serviceable, they’re sidekicks. I don’t see either replacing Karr.I did enjoy the book’s opening sequences in Tajikistan. There’s interesting background on tensions between Tajiks, Russians trying to maintain Soviet-era influence there, and Indians with new bases there.William Rubens keeps fighting the bureaucratic wars. Charlie Dean is always the brave last guy out at the last minute, shooting bad guys and grabbing on to some helicopter lifting off under fire. DeFrancesca is always telling men who are sexist pigs to bleep off.I also think they lean too much on military equipment acronyms. Some of this is OK as it creates verisimilitude, but they do it far too much, including when they don’t follow up by telling you what’s unique or interesting or relevant about it. This series' high-tech edge may be wearing thin; you sense they're trying a little too hard to impress you with the latest greatest guns and scopes that aren't really that new and cool anymore.Anyway, not my favorite book in this series, but I’m a big Coonts fan in general and plan to keep reading Deep Black books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQYIGCOWNYHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OUXEIS#wasThisHelpful","R1TQYIGCOWNYHU","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are solid, heavy-duty and work well, a good value for the money. They're not particularly attractive - they have that industrial look - so you'll want them in places where they don't show or where it doesn't matter.

"At the outset of this enjoyable but lengthy installment in the “Presidential Agent” series, Charley Castillo begins to interrogate a fugitive American UN diplomat implicated in the Oil-for-Food scandal, only to be attacked on a Uruguayan ranch by masked gunmen who kill the man and one of Castillo’s men, before being taken out themselves.There’s no sign of who they are or who they work for. An assassination attempt is also made on Castillo’s family friend Eric Kocian, the crusty old publisher of a Hungarian newspaper Castillo’s chain owns. He’s been poking into the scandal, in which Iraqi oil is embargoed in the years before the Iraq invasion, some allowed to be sold for food and medicine, but fortunes made (including by corrupt UN bureaucrats) as the rules are circumvented.Castillo is charged by the president with getting to the bottom of it all, including the murder of a US ambassador and kidnapping of his wife – sister of the suspected corrupt UN diplomat. He doesn’t know who he can trust, even in his own government. He has an uneasy field relationship with Russian gangster and arms trafficker Aleksandr Pevsner, who employs a disgraced and wanted former FBI agent.He must fight a turf war with the director of national intelligence, threatened by Castillo’s direct line to the president, and learn how to infight in Washington. On the other hand, Castillo’s new agency now has a source of funding: oil-for-food scam proceeds, spirited out of secret bank accounts. And he gathers a motley crew of military, espionage and cop operatives around him as his impromptu new team.Some real-world details intrigue if indeed true: Did Vladimir Putin make his personal fortune in the oil-for-food scandal? And did Adolf Hitler, who reputedly had only one testicle, lose the other one in the first World War to a patriotic Belgian dog?Griffin locates much of the story in the cone of South America where he also located his “Honor Bound” series about OSS operations there against Nazis during World War II. There are a lot of echoes of it, beginning with Castillo being strongly reminiscent of that series’ protagonist Cletus Frade. Each is a wealthy Texan. Each is military and a pilot. Each is from a complicated binational background involving two different wealthy families, one of them Hispanic, in essence having multiple identities and nationalities. Each finds out he is an innately skilled improviser of clandestine operations.I was a little disappointed that the oil-for-food scandal itself didn’t get more attention. It’s the McGuffin – the thing everyone wants – but other than a couple of pages devoted to how it worked late in the book, we don’t hear that much about it. I would have enjoyed seeing the UN’s feet put to the fire a little more closely here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234FTSOELQIKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R1BAII#wasThisHelpful","R234FTSOELQIKY","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’m really impressed with the Jack Reacher series. In this one, Child just keeps gently, but inexorably, ratcheting up the tension. He’s an inventive writer and I found the scenario fairly unique. Reacher finds himself working as a government plant in the home of a rug dealer suspected of being a drug dealer, agreeing to it because the latter is close to another criminal Reacher has some long-ago nasty history with. And only slowly and gradually do we learn what history is.That said, the style has deep roots in popular thrillers. Reacher gets into a large, isolated estate on the Maine seacoast. Very Gothic. The dealer’s unhappy family and the huge, high-on-steroids scary thug Paulie are right out of Hammett or Chandler (where the latter would have been described as “hopped up.”)  Child makes a nod to Chandler in some dinnertable conversation between Reacher and the family.I don’t want to say too much about the plot because I don’t want to give anything away, not even the opening scenario which really drew me in. Reacher must himself impersonate a thug to gain the drug dealer’s trust and find his way into his inner circle in a matter of days – to crack his ring, bring him to justice and rescue a missing government agent before his cover is blown.Reacher fascinates in his ingenuity under pressure and his ability to come up with strategems extracting himself from impossible jams. And he’s full of useful tidbits of information. I never knew, for instance, that commercial metal detectors have a dead zone near the floor  to avoid being set off by the metal shanks stiffening the soles of people’s shoes, that 19th century locks can be picked in seconds, or that the odds of surviving Russian roulette played with a well-maintained handgun are vastly in the shooter’s favor. Why?

"Robert Littell is unique among espionage and intrigue novelists in the extent to which he is willing to experiment stylistically. Some books like ""The Company"" are straight-ahead style.  Others, like this one, are black-comic in tone. In one, ""The Stalin Epigram"", each chapter was told from the point of view of a different character. In another he has a story set within a story.This is one of his earlier books. It's set in the Brezhnev era, when the government no longer rules by overwhelming terror but the memory and possibility of it still linger - and the government still wrecks the lives of those who make the faintest peep of dissent.The economy is decayed, Communism has been reduced to empty shibboleths that people mouth but no one believes, and there's a shortage of everything. No one has yet heard of glasnost or perestroika.Our character, with the unlikely name of Robespierre Pravdin, is a fixer, who lives by his wits, obtaining hard-to-get items for those who can pay or trade him something in return. Bolshoi tickets? Beatles albums? Birth control pills? Some new blue jeans? He's your guy.He has a crippled thumb, courtesy of a 12-year stint in the gulags when he was one of many World War II soldiers imprisoned for nothing. As an ex-con and a Jew, he is unemployable, and hence his illegal occupation.  He's an entertaining guy, who crashes conventions and receptions for both the free food and the opportunity to make contacts and glean the information that keeps him ahead of the black-market curve. (And the police.)His Moscow residential building being scheduled for demolition, he finds new lodgings. His new neighbors are a grab-bag of eccentrics - the mortician who cares for Lenin's body, a retired two-star general, some young hippies. And also Mother Russia, a batty but shrewd old woman determined to clear the name of her husband, who was executed during the purges. A government-celebrated author is believed to have actually plagiarized his work, and Mother Russia's late husband was the sole literary judge not to go along with the official story. (This is a thinly disguised version of questions surrounding Mikhail Sholokhov and ""Quiet Flows the Don"", which won the Nobel Prize in 1965 but whose authorship of it was contested.)Now the original manuscript by the real author has turned up.  Mother Russia wants Pravdin to use his connections and wiles to make sure the truth sees the light of day. Pravdin uses all his skills to do so in the shadows without showing his hand, but inevitably the KGB finds out about it.I was initially put off by the black-comic style, as Littell lays it on pretty heavily and I initially saw it as fiction-writing immaturity. (And my first Littell book, ""The Company"", was both so good and in the straight-ahead style that I am subconsciously hoping whatever next Littell book I read is going to be like that one.)However, once I got into the rhythm of it, I liked it a lot better. There are overtones of Joseph Heller's ""Catch 22"" and Ken Kesey's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" here in its use of absurd humor and in the theme of what it means to be sane in an insane society.I particularly liked the characterization of Pravdin. He writes subversive graffiti. He has certain catchphrases, like introducing himself in gatecrashing situations as ""at your beck and call."" His whole being is subversive. He's Jewish, for starters, making him a second-class citizen in this supposedly classless society.  His comically elegant manners hearken to those of pre-revolutionary Europe, those, say, of a hand-kissing, heel-clicking Austrian.  (Pravdin clicks together the heels of his high-top sneakers.) He often forms sentences in a flagrantly backwards style - I think it's meant to be a defiant use of Yiddish-influenced speaking style - the better to deliver some mordant commentary or pointed retort.I got the feeling that Littell later on used a lot of the same elements in the more sweeping and developed ""The Revolutionist"", which traces two revolutionaries who return to Russia from the U.S. in 1917 and then live through the years of turmoil following it. It has some of the same elements, including a large house with a grab-bag of colorful characters, an examination of the hollowness of revolutionary promise, and a defiant protagonist with Jewish roots.This is still an enjoyable book, particularly for those with a taste for black comedy. Although it's not long, it drags occasionally, when the author and characters spend a little too much time pondering the nature of things, or near the end where plot elements are resolved through a lengthy series of letters Mother Russia writes to the Singer Sewing Machine Company. You read that right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0G4Y42JIFMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KX47GI#wasThisHelpful","R1X0G4Y42JIFMW","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A shocking assault on a U.S. embassy in Switzerland sends the Scorpion on a dangerous series of encounters throughout Europe, before being inserted into Iran to track down the terror attack’s architect. Known only as “The Gardener”, he’s the most feared man in Iran, his identity known to only a few – and the Scorpion has to eliminate him without even knowing who he is. IF he can't, there will be war.It’s a decent page-turner, with the U.S. itching to attack Iran if it can be proven it was behind the attack. But Scorpion can’t understand: why would Iran do such an attack knowing the likely American response? Meanwhile, the Israelis are lurking in the background, concerned about Iran’s nuclear program, knowing an American attack on Iran will put them in jeopardy, and making hints that they’ll attack first.There are a lot of twists and turns as the Scorpion uses his matchless tradecraft to move in and out of countries and cities, to develop and carry out ingenious tactics and to stay one step ahead of all those who’d like to kill him.He’s kind of a bloodless hero, though. Kaplan gives him a love interest here to flesh him out a bit; a French doctor doing charity work in an African refugee camp where Scorpion, wanting out of the business, has gone to lose himself and think about what to do with his life.I found some minor anomalies. There are multiple references to Scorpion’s favorite Glock, worn on his ankle, but he crosses several borders, including airport security searches, without it being detected. That’s not likely. And in Iran, he is given a high-tech sniper rifle, and then makes his long-range shot without ever having zeroed his scope (which requires practice-shooting it, I believe) to ensure its accurate synching with the weapon.Still, Scorpion is a resourceful lone operator (he’s a freelancer) whose adventures make good reading. The scenes of his operating on his own in Iran are particularly good, as is his dramatic extraction. There are a lot of twists and turns that continue right up until the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXYAELD2CZZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NF6H6O#wasThisHelpful","RBXYAELD2CZZP","A1TWH3KD5YJQHM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TWH3KD5YJQHM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seems good for the price, so far.  Dry erase markers write well and wipe off cleanly, and the clapper makes a sharp sound when called upon to do so, which pretty much sums up the features and functions of this object.The pivot bolt is begging for a drop of blue Loctite or something, should have had that from the factory so it wouldn't fall apart when handled, but if you do it, it'll quit backing out all the time and you will never have to fiddle with it again.

"Beautiful, heavy wall stainless bottle.  Nice lid and tether, machined nalgene-standard water filter compatible threads.  This is the sexy, skinny 24 oz travel model, and it's great in the side pocket of a day pack, or in your car's cup holder, with its skinny base.  I'm collecting these Guyot bottles in all their varieties, apparently; they're the nicest bottles I've seen if you don't mind the moderate weight, and water's heavy anyway, so for everything but ultralight backpacking, these are awesome, durable bottles, very hard to dent, unlike most thin-wall offerings from others.  They can rust, like all stainless, if you're not careful.  Don't let moisture stay inside with the lid on, or you'll be trying to tape 400-grit sandpaper to the end of a stick and get enough leverage to resurface the inside of your bottle...  pro tip there, don't ask me how I know...

"I love these except the high price, which I think is bordering on the absurd especially for these smaller pieces; the half-round stick-on things made of the same stuff are a pretty good value as bookshelf speaker feet, redneck isolators for your budget mini hifi setup with audiophile pretensions, but these grommet things are really pricey for what you get.  They're small.  These had better last literally forever, or I will be upset.However, they're pretty cool for what they are, aside from the sticker shock for a few bits of plastic, and if you need durable vibration-damping mounts, what else are you going to do?  I'm using some of these to mount a custom subwoofer box into a VW bus in such a way as to not drive the flat sheetmetal into resonance any more than necessary.  These mounts, along with some of the larger flat doughnuts, some FatMat, and a heavy sub box, ought to get a clean sound even in that difficult environment.  And to be fair, you get twelve of them in the package.  I'll mount my sub box and my glassblowing fan with these, and have some left over for a random project.  But you have to buy the matching washers separately, which really begins to look like highway robbery.  I guess I should just shut up about the price, as I bought these things and the washers too, thus proving that despite what I might say, I do feel that they're worth it.  I just feel like they should be cheaper, for some reason.  I guess I'm wrong, though, because they're not.As the other reviewer noted, 70 is pretty soft and rubbery, 50 is gummy bear.  Haven't tried 30, but it must be downright gooey, and I haven't needed that yet.  Watch the weight and don't overload these.  The chemistry is weird, and can attack plastics, finishes, carpet, and who knows what else; beware.I'll post back with durability updates eventually, but if you need a vibration isolating mount, here they are.

"This is about as close to perfect as a mouse can get, IMO.  Logitech makes great mice.  I have an ancient optical Mx310 that still works perfectly, and it's okay, but this is amazing, especially for the price.  I wanted a nice mouse, decided I'd try this one and spend more if it didn't work out, but no need.  This is great.  Medium heavy, perfect action, nice barely tacky rubber on the sides.  I think the buttons are perfect.  I reassigned my scroll wheel button to command-w to close windows, and I love it, no problems with hard button push or hitting the side scroll.  If you're super uncoordinated, I guess you might not like the scroll wheel button functions, but you can just ignore them.The loose scroll wheel takes some getting used to, but I like it.  I do wish it was more responsive at super slow speed; slow scrolling does almost nothing, even at full speed and full acceleration in the Logitech control panel app thingy which you must download to get the tricky functions working.  Whatever, you learn to flick the wheel up and down, which is smooth and fun, and gives good control once you get the hang of it.  It could be even better, but it's pretty sweet the way it is.For around twenty five bucks, this is a great deal.

"Fine cut-resistant gloves, but way too small.  I dutifully measured, and ordered the indicated medium size, which seemed reasonable, as I am a medium-sized man.  They fit my wife, who is 5'9 and 125lb...  So mediums are good for a slender woman, not a medium man.  She's keeping them and I am ordering a large, or an extra large.[Edit- the seller contacted me to say they've fixed the size chart problem, plus they sent me out a free pair of XL size.  Awesome service and one extra star just for that; I'll upgrade to five stars when the gloves arrive and fit!]Okay, the XL's fit me perfectly, just a bit snug.  These are women's sizes, or something.  A big guy with man hands might not be able to fit in the XL's, but for most guys, that's what to try first, I'd think.These do what they claim, protect you from accidental slices.

"Horrible, dangerous, useless trap, waiting to break whatever gear you attach it to.I got my new mini ball head, opened the package, and it literally fell apart.  The 1/4"" screw and platform are pressed into the ball via a tapered shaft.  The instant some torque gets applied to that shaft, it separates from the ball.  If your camera is attached, goodbye.This piece of garbage will break your gear the first time it gets bumped, or maybe the second or third, but eventually it will fail, guaranteed.  Avoid.  It's not to be trusted for anything, period.  Obviously, the shaft needs to screw in to the ball and not be radically prone to falling out.  Obviously, you don't press a tapered shaft lightly into a ball and call it good.  Horrible, criminally negligent design.  Appears deliberately constructed to break something for you.  The maker should be sued into oblivion, but good luck with that now that our trade deals have given corporations not only personhood but effective sovereignty.  Now we can enjoy fine products of Chinese capitalism like this, which make China lots of money by breaking your gear, thus forcing you to replace it.  Does this look inexpensive to you?  This could easily be the most expensive piece of gear you ever buy, seriously.  Whatever you do, don't actually attach a camera to this thing.Buy American, from trusted sellers.  I've bought and had to return so much junk off of Amazon lately that I'm about done.  Low prices are not attractive when the quality is even lower.This thing is junk.  The ball is super rough.  It doesn't lay over 90 degrees in the notch, more like 83...  There is nothing right with this and it should not be purchased by anyone, ever.  The maker ought to be publicly beaten and humiliated.  And Amazon ought to screen out garbage like this, or it will become Ali Express, which really sucks because everything is misrepresented junk.CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!![Got a replacement.  It works and has not fallen apart even with a bit of twisting.  I'd never trust it with anything more than a super cheap light fixture, but for something like that it might do.

"No idea what anyone might actually want this for IRL, but for the money, you really can't beat it; this thing costs less than the sheath alone for a big-name high-end tomahawk.  Do be aware of potential quality issues; I got one from Midway that was pretty wonky, main blade off center and badly ground, a Monday lemon or something.  I got with Cold Steel and after some calls, I sent some photos, called again, and eventually they sent out a new one, and let me keep the old one for a beater, which was nice of them.  The new one is straight and proper, sharp, too.  The differential heat treat is nice, as I found when I started filing and melting edges.  I'll throw and abuse that beater and see if I can break or bend something...The non-sharpened edges and finish in general aren't anything amazing, about what you'd expect for the price, kinda rough.  I'm going to round and polish everything, just because.  If I ever have to break this thing out, the S has definitely hit the F, and if you've got a bit of bling in a situation like that, all the better.  Come the zombie apocalypse, it's great to have any tomahawk at all, sure, but having one of these with a nice custom finish?  Points for style for sure.  Yep, I've been watching too much Walking Dead.The sheath is interesting and almost actually useful.  It does protect you from the pointy bits, but that's it, and that's not really enough.  I can see several ways to make it a useful way of carrying your 'hawk on belt, rig, or pack, but at present, without some work, it really isn't.  You can't actually attach it to anything, which is an issue.  The way it is now, it's pretty secure, but very slow to open.  It needs to be really secure, but also accessible, and instant to access.  At present the snap strap is fumbly and awkward, and how can you attach it to anything?  If you use the grommets at front or back, the thing will hang all wrong, and if you use both, you can't open the sheath because it needs to hinge.  Hmm.  Somebody thought this thing brilliantly about halfway through.  I'm going to work on some mods.Oh, well.  This is pretty much a toy or a man cave decoration anyway, not really a serious tactical accessory, if we're honest.  I mean, sure, it'll split a head, but when or where would you actually carry it and use it before something else, like ferinstance an AR or a Glock or just a big knife?  Now, if some magic were to cause all firearms to stop working, a 'hawk would attain a whole new level of relevance, but until then...  It's a big chunk of steel and black plastic to lug around.  I suspect most of these don't get carried much, but I'd still like to work out a really slick battle-ready sheath, just because.I've decided it's a vehicular accessory.  My plan is to bolt the sheath inside one of my vehicles, and have the thing within reach.  The way the sheath works, about the only way is to have the 'hawk blade down, with the front part of the sheath attached to the car, and then raise the end of the handle up in an arc to free the spike; it has to kind of rotate out.  I can justify it to my wife by explaining its many life-saving uses in an accident, like breaking glass, prying open (or hacking through) stuck doors, cutting seat belts, and of course dispatching any rogue zombies or smallish dragons present at the accident scene.

"I had high expectations of a $50 ""super"" pliers.  The rough draggy action didn't really live up.  They've smoothed out a bit with use and lube, but I sure wish they were better.  They should have made the rotating pin and the surface it contacts more precise, at least; it bumps and chunks along, and there's no way to get to it to polish it because it's a rivet, pressed in.  Fit and finish is generally underwhelming, plenty of burrs and sharp edges where they ought not be, plus the front edges don't mate up smooth, looks imprecise and isn't good for holding things evenly with the tip.I bought the best I could find, just wish it was a bit better value.  One vinyl handle cover thing fell off on day one just playing around with them, lame.  Glue them on if you want them to stay, I guess.  The pliers aren't very ergonomic; the best seems to be to rest your thumb on the back curve of the wire cutter piece.  The teflon finish is highly imperfect largely because the steel underneath wasn't finished particularly well, seems like a waste.  How about melting the sharp edges and doing a real Tenifer coating or something?  Thought a $50 English-made pliers would be really well finished, but not so much.  I'm going to buy a pair of the $15 China parallel pliers to compare.My grandpa had a pair of similar looking parallel pliers that were so much better, it's not even funny.  Silky smooth, perfect.  Wish I had those, but they somehow disappeared...  As I get older, I realize the old guys were right along: they don't make 'em like they used to.

"Three thick bone picks.  Might work well for bass players and/or ogres.  These picks come with a squared off blunt edge, definitely need some bevel work to be nice, IMO.  And the sides are slick and smooth; I'll maybe sand for some grit and grip.  The other reviewer who said they're more like blanks is right on.  And when you file or sand or whatever, watch out, these are the stinkiest bone I've had the displeasure of smelling, pure death, could seriously turn you vegan.  I might boil mine or something to get rid of the reeking dead cow smell; it's a serious issue, leaves my fingers smelling really foul.  Not sure if I like these at all, for anything.

"This is more of a dangerous toy or an inferior weapon, not so much a useful trainer.  It's way light.  And quite hard.I just naively assumed that of course it would be the same weight as the real thing, and have a dense but soft, flexible blade and spike, but nope, it's hard and light.  I think that's pretty lame and potentially quite dangerous.  This thing is pretty useless as is.  What can you actually do with it?How hard would it have been to mold the blade in soft rubber and/or mold in a weight or something?  They just did it one-piece, the cheapest possible way.  How are you going to practice with something that feels and balances different from the real thing?  If you flip this thing around or throw it, or just hold it, it's balanced totally different from a real 'hawk, so how is that a trainer?  I guess you can drill into it and add some weight, if you care enough.  It's so hard that you can't do any impact with it or you'll hurt your partner; it's basically an oddly shaped plastic club.  I guess depending on what you want it for, you could add weight, or padding, as appropriate.  I'd rather it was soft on the striking edges and came with a removable weight for when you want to use padding, along with some extra soft padding to add for combat training...  Now, _that_ would be a nice trainer.  And it wouldn't have to cost much more to produce.  And Cold Steel could design a good sheath someday...  Okay, I'll wake up now.  Buy this one and mod it to suit, I guess.  It's super cheap at least.  Be careful playing around sparring with this as is; it's light (fast) and hard, begging to knock somebody's tooth out, break a nose, crack a rib, or just put a big nasty bruise on your training partner, and who wants that?  If you're using it solo, for katas or strength or whatever, I'd think you'd want it heavier than actual, if anything.

"Hot little rock at a reasonable price.  My PRM-8000 immediately said 700+ CPM at almost point blank range when out of the packaging, which is more than I want to hang out with for very long, so I didn't spend any time trying the other side for a higher reading.  The sheet that came with the material listed some 50,000 CPM activity, which I'm guessing is calculated total activity, or just a reading from a much more sensitive detector than mine.  People sometimes don't understand that CPM numbers are dependent on the size and type of detector used, among other things.  CPM on its own doesn't really mean that much; it's more about knowing how your detector behaves, what's normal, and what's not.  For my detector, 18 CPM is normal background; 700 is really something.After having the new counter read a rock-steady 18 CPM average for months, I almost wondered if it was actually working as a detector, so I got this rock rather than making a trip to the mineralogy museum to visit their uranium sample...  Oh, yeah, it works!  Pretty dramatic, flashing light almost constantly lit, alarm going off...  Works great, scared my wife... :)Were I a Geiger counter maker, I'd include a check source like this with each and every one.  It's great to see exactly how the counter responds at different distances, how long it takes to average and react, etc.  Also instills the desire for a more sensitive detector... :)Anybody with a Geiger counter should probably have a radioactive source with which to test it.  That ends up being ironic, because if you want a Geiger counter to help you avoid exposure to radiation, you end up getting extra exposure from your test source, if nowhere else.  I'm not all that worried about it, but I am keeping this little piece of subatomic weaponry rather far from my fragile human body, as a rule.  This is like a miniature machine gun, and when you hold it close, it's spewing little energetic bullets that tear through your DNA, breaking it, causing replication errors, mutations...  Seven hundred microscopic wounds per minute, or maybe fifty thousand; either way, I'll pass if I can, thanks...I may make a little lead-lined wormwood box to hold this.  The lead is probably more tightly regulated than this stuff, which is funny, because lead can't mutate your great grandchildren by your simply being next to it.  Some might say that being near this stuff for a while won't harm you, and some will even say that low level exposure can be therapeutic; the hormesis theory.  For my part, I'll limit my exposure to the degree possible, thanks.  If you want to wear this as jewelry or play with it and then suck on your fingers, or make it into a lollipop or sprinkle it on toast, I guess you can do so freely, thanks to Amazon, America, and freedom!  Me, I'll be cautious and prudent :)  I am glad that we have the freedom to do foolish things, but I wish we didn't exercise it so often...  Ahem.The listing could have been a bit clearer about exactly what was being sold; the description was a little vague, and I thought the sample pic was the actual sample I'd be getting.  Whatever, I'm happy and got what I wanted for a reasonable price, but if you want a specific size or CPM, maybe contact the seller first or something.  I just wanted a sort of go/no go tester, not anything calibrated or powerful, so this little chunk fit my needs perfectly, and I'm glad it's not hotter, actually.

"This is what it says on Uncle Bill's website: ""Uncle Bill's Sliver Gripper is all about an American success story. We follow Uncle Bill's model of an American made quality tool that is still hand polished and hand sharpened just as Uncle Bill did 30 years ago.""However, when I saw that my new tweezers were nothing like my old ones, I called to get the straight scoop.  The guy I talked to told me that twenty years ago, they completely changed how they were made.  They guy I spoke with told me that the tweezers would cost ""forty bucks each"" if they were still made the old way.The old ones had really sweet precise points.  These don't.  These are cheaply stamped, poorly finished where it counts, at the tip.  They don't work anything like the old ones, unless and until you put a bevel and a point on them.They can't simultaneously claim that these are made the old way, and also say that they'd cost $40 each if they were. I don't appreciate the cheapening of a beloved survival tool, nor being lied to about it.I am keeping these under protest, and putting a point and an edge on them myself, which will certainly take me a couple of hours, thus raising the cost of these tweezers to forty bucks a piece, in terms of my time...So buy these if you must.  The guy claimed they hadn't made the metal thinner over the years, but I would almost swear that my old pair was stiffer and less susceptible to sideways deflection.  Whatever.

"XLNT.  I'm really impressed with the PII Pro.  It's the brightest light of this size I've tried, and it throws a nice beam, hot in the center but with some spread, amazing and very useful output for such a tiny thing.I just gave up on another brand with a switch that just wouldn't stay off, and was thus too annoying to carry.  This one is perfect for the key 'biner.  This has a quality look and feel, easily worth the extra bucks over cheap generic versions for carry.  Nothing sucks like needing light and lacking it; carry at least one quality light at all times.  I got a bunch of the little cheapies to scatter around in cars and toolbags and such, but it makes sense to carry a good one.I'll post an update if it ever fails or does anything wrong, but so far the PII Pro seems pretty ideal.As others have said, it ships in demo mode, which turns off automatically after a few seconds to save battery.  You have to hold down the button for twenty seconds, till the light turns off, to get it out of demo mode, if you want to be able to actually use it.  It's just tragic that some reviewers here couldn't figure that out without so much needless suffering.  RTFM, kids.There's absolutely no function to this light but off/on; no strobe, dimmer, and no ability to do Morse code, because of the electronic switch.  The instructions are: Press button for On/Off.  That's it.  That's fine with me; I don't know any Morse code apart from SOS anyway...  I sort of assumed that because this light has a microprocessor, it would know some tricks or dim or something, but nope.  It's a small, bright white light, with a demo mode.  Period.It also comes with a little plastic holder ""docking station"" strung on a garrotte, I mean a thin cord.  Not something I'd wear around my neck, but whatever, it's an option.

I received a one-pound bag of bone chips numbering forty, not sixty plus- just noticed that the listing descriptions don't agree on whether this is supposed to be 40 or 60.  Seeing as only six of the pieces were long enough to possibly get a 2-7/8"" saddle out of, and they're all thin, I don't think sixty real bone saddle blanks would weigh just one pound...  Anyway, nothing in here that could be a nut, all too thin.

"Nice, attractive, simple, modern, pretty cool itty bitty trash can.  I'm not sure what it's best suited for, because once you put a napkin or two in it, the lid gets stuck, can't really move, as is illustrated nicely by the product photo.  It's pretty small, and the lid could be finished a bit nicer; it's sharp edged and rather roughly stamped, could have been thicker and nicer metal.  A modder could stick some Sculpey or something inside the lid to give it heft and inertia/momentum, and deaden the ping, if one wanted to obsess and take the mini trashcan to the next level, which would be ridiculous, but I may just do it...  Being as this thing is stainless, it's a good value if you need a little tabletop, bedside, desktop, or elsewhere trash can, especially if you make small and frequent bits of trash for whatever reason, as I so often do for so many reasons.  Remember:  Cleanliness is next to Godliness, but OCD is just a disease...  :)  My mini can has a big vertical scratch on the top part, unfortunately.  If I cared, I'd return it, but I'm going to beat this thing up anyway, scratch it, dent it, so I don't mind.  I'm in it for the long haul, hence the stainless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DS6EWNH1JJZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3PU6QE#wasThisHelpful","R1DS6EWNH1JJZM","A17OA5A06LI2C1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17OA5A06LI2C1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got two, the first one was open, dirty, used, and cracked.  The second one was brand new, in a sealed box, and still cracked.  There's a hairline crack at every single hole, and a couple elsewhere, too, all over the black base piece.  How or why this is acceptable to Dremel, I have no idea.  I guess I'll keep the thing, because I need it immediately, and it does work, but I do believe I'll make my own mounting table with metal hardware and a non-plastic chassis, maybe corian or laminate or tough plastic or something.I'll update on the progress of these cracks and when/if this thing fails.  Plus, I'll look into a good glue for cracks in ABS.  ABS plumbing cement or something...  Seems like I always have to work on my tools before I can do work with them, and it seems like things in general are getting exponentially cheaper but ever more expensive...  Meh.  If I had it to do over, I might just save the $30 and make my own, but I am lazier than I am thrifty, so it stays.  One last complaint, though- it's allegedly made so that you can inset it into the underside of your work surface, and they show a cutout shape you could use, but it neglects the ""Dremel"" badge at the front.  That should have been vertical or horizontal, but not set at the pointless 45* it is, which gets in the way if you want to inset the thing.  I guess you could always Dremel off the Dremel badge...  I think I'll make up a handmade high-quality version of this in metal and sell it on Etsy.  Wonder if Amazon allows such talk?  If you read this, they do!Contacted Dremel.  At first, I was completely blown off.  Then I was insulted and lied to.  Then I was sent yet another one.  Will it be any better than the first two?  I'll update when it gets here.  For now, I am shocked and appalled at the blatant lies the rep told me.  Between the ""quality"" of this piece and the rep, I am having serious doubts about the Dremel organization.  Perhaps I'll move up to Foredom before I spend any more money on Dremel.  Hmm.Third one got here.  It's cracked, too.  I give up.  Saving my pennies for better gear.

"Super effective and powerful.  Not a whiff of ozone that I can smell, and I'm pretty sensitive.Beware unwanted static effects; I was wearing a set of stereo headphones, experimentally put my hand too near the ionizer antenna, a few inches away, and I received a nice jolt through the helix of my right pinna, near Darwin's tubercule, in fact, for my curiosity.  Did it again, and sure enough, it's a repeatable effect.  Twice was plenty; it was a pretty stout zap both times, so clearly, 1) the thing is working and 2) should be physically avoided by headphone users especially.After hearing a repeated clicking, I realized that the nearby metal storage shelf was becoming charged up, then periodically discharging, with visible blue spark, across a plastic insulator.  So yeah, it definitely works.  Also, don't put the thing near one of your stereo speakers, or it will charge it up, causing intermittent static discharge within the amp, I guess.  The best seems to be putting the unit equidistant from the two speakers.I'll maybe think about a grounded metal plate somewhere nearby that I can clean every so often; if not, the nearest grounded thing, or just the walls, gets coated with dust, which means that I'm not breathing it, but I will have to clean it up somehow eventually.Also, this thing puts out a LOT of electromagnetic energy, strong magnetic pulses and a strong electrical field; I wouldn't spend much time within about four feet of it if you're at all concerned about EMF exposure.  And it will seriously zap you if you touch the antenna, so don't.Buy one if you're in the market, beware the hazards, and enjoy both the amusing '70's-futuristic Battlestar Galactica styling and a seriously powerful machine that will ionize the particles in your air, and anything else, including you, that gets too close.  As a bonus, if you put your hand in between the ion detector and the antenna, the thing screams and surges the output; not recommended but entertaining, and proof that the ion detector is more than just a randomly blinking LED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26V1H81XD21A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GXLH2K#wasThisHelpful","R26V1H81XD21A2","A17OA5A06LI2C1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17OA5A06LI2C1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As anyone who regularly reads my reviews knows by now, I'm a fan of the travel memoir in all its forms. If its basis is an epic quest whether driving the length of the continent, hiking border to border, or biking across Europe, I'm there. If someone wrote a book about setting out to eat at all the Taco Bells in South Dakota, I'd give it a try. Wild Tanuki with its tale of skateboarding the length of Japan seems like it should be a perfect fit. The reality is mixed.Some of the things I like to read about in a book like this were covered. Among these were the logistics, both the anticipated issues that were planned for and those that weren't (like wearing out shoes fast) along with how the author overcame those roadblocks. I like comparing the area being traversed and the people the author interacts with to my own world and experiences – answering questions like: What things are the same about the people and places and what is different? What parts of the authors experience surprised me?Last, I'm interested in getting an idea of the author's reaction to the experience. This may be profound, or not, but no one subjects themselves to this kind of trip without coming away with some lessons, even if it is only the realization that they'd never do that again. The author does a good job in the epilogue putting the experience and what he got from it in perspective.However, there were a couple things that overshadowed the good for me. First is the need for a more through copyediting and proofreading job to shake out the many typos, grammar issues, and unclear sentences that made it into the final version. Second is, well here's an example, edited to hopefully make it past the various censors:""In front of the shrine, I threw 20 cents into a box, rang the bell, and bowed with my hands together while praying for a long life filled with many <instances of being pleased orally>. I’m still in my 20s and that consumes most of my thoughts. It means I’m healthy.""While some may, I don't have an issue with that. I think most people understand that a normal guy in his 20s is probably going to be obsessed with sex. In case they don't remember, a reminder like this is fine. Maybe even a couple of them. However, there comes a point where it's beating a dead horse, telling the reader what they already know and doing nothing to move the story forward. This was especially true in the author's apparent obsession with pleasuring himself, speaking of dead horses. There were also times where the way the story was told, whether explicitly sexual or not, went over the line for me to the point of being offensive, some would say misogynistic. For example at one point he was feeling depressed, didn't know why, but (in so many words) said that he knew it wasn't because he was a woman at a certain point in her cycle.Maybe I'm a prude. More likely is much of the content had no place in a book of this genre. However, I'm sure some subset of the potential audience would be fine with this. If you're one of them, this review should help point the way.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"While You Were Gone is billed as a companion novella to Moretti's NYT bestseller, While You Were Out and has a brief note at the beginning that explains the connection.

It turns out that you don't need to remember the first to enjoy the second.As for the story itself, it's a good one. It explores themes of family, love, and loss. It also delves into how we often start down a path in life, not always through a conscious decision, and can become committed to that path for no good reason.

"When a Warrior Comes Home is an intense page-turner. This is true of the war scenes, early in the book, and the intensity continues when the warriors bring the war home with them. It's populated with some great characters that you'll like or, when some of them aren't very likeable, you'll at least sympathize with them.While there is a lot more to the story, ultimately this book is about the human cost of war. Not the obvious, of lives lost on both sides, but of lives broken and the domino effect in the impact on families and communities. If you've ever been around an ex-soldier who suffers from PTSD, you'll recognize the authenticity of Mr. Barber's portrayal. It would be easy for a book like this to take an overt political stance. (I'm having a hard time not doing that in this review.)

"When I asked Google for a definition of the word noir, it came up with this:""A genre of crime film or fiction characterized by cynicism, fatalism, and moral ambiguity.""That definition nails it, at least when considering What Happens in Reno. I normally feel that a reader needs to like at least one of the main characters in a book and none of the people who inhabit this fast-paced tale are very likeable. Yet, I still enjoyed the read, wondering where the story was going, only sensing that it wasn't going to be a pretty ending. And boy, what an incredible ending it was.

"The premise: the moon disappears (along with all evidence it ever existed) and only one man, Daniel, remembers.Once you buy into the premise, this is an interesting story that works as just a story. You wonder where it will go and how it will resolve itself. Since everyone who reads this knows the moon exists, we're on Daniel's side. (Unless something has changed and no one other than me believes this anymore. If that's the case, please don't comment and tell me.) But if you're prone to seeing more in a story than the actual story, this one might send your mind off in all kinds of directions. Maybe considering the concepts of normality, sanity, and madness.

"If you've ever had a friend post a humorous looking picture on Facebook and ask his or her friends to provide a caption, you'll have a good idea of what to expect with The Commode Companion. The origins of the name should be apparent. It's the perfect book for those times when you're looking for entertainment in bite-sized bits. The just shy of 100 pictures and Margenau's suggested captions should do the trick for a few visits to the room down the hall. How many will depend on how regular you are. I found the captions humorous and amusing. For the Kindle edition, the book works fine on an eink based ereader, but the pictures are much better in color. Use your tablet computer or smartphone for best results.The book description calls this book “interactive.” What this is getting at, explained more fully in the book's introduction, is the author invites readers to propose alternative captions.

"As part of the book description the author or publisher describe Ooga Booga as “one of the first fictional renderings of the #BlackLivesMatter movement told via a speculative, futuristic lens.” It may be nitpicking, but I'm not sure I agree with that. While undeniably speculative and futuristic, Ooga Booga has nothing to do with the movement and making that connection feels more like a marketing ploy than anything else. However, it could be viewed as a way to show why that movement is needed. The addition of the speculative elements might make the subject more palatable for those who would be uncomfortable were it to hew too close to contemporary truths.Regardless of the applicability or lack thereof to current events, I found myself making those comparisons. While part of my brain rebelled against accepting the isolation camps, the comparisons to the Japanese internment camps of World War II were too obvious to not accept the possibility. I found Ooga Booga to be an interesting thought experiment, playing a game of “what if,” which seems to me what speculative fiction of this kind is all about.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"On the surface, Making Amends is a suspense novel, with all that implies. The point of view changes from chapter to chapter between three main characters.Tabby, the mother of two identical twin boys, Ricky and Bobby. Kidnapped by his father when he was five, twenty-five long years ago, Bobby has not been heard from since. Then he's arrested for killing his father. Tabby has always felt guilty about Bobby's kidnapping, thinking she should have prevented it.The second POV character is Ricky, who has always had ambiguous feelings about Bobby's kidnapping, wondering why their father only took one of them.Last, Tabby's best friend Von, who has been involved in Tabby's life since before the twins were born. She provides a more realistic point of view, helping temper Tabby's self-recriminating thoughts.The changing view points are clearly labeled at the start of each chapter and the transitions were easy for me to follow. From the descriptions of the characters above, you might have already gathered that while the story is suspense, the psychological aspects as they struggle with and try to come to terms with their pasts are actually where the best part of the story lies. In the process, it will set your mind reeling with thoughts and questions about responsibility, family and friendship, and the nature of evil.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"The niche this book is aimed at, making money online, is one that certainly has a market. Whether you're looking to use the internet to find a market for your unique skills, as you might do on Fiverr, or find additional ways to generate revenue from an existing website, maybe through advertising using Google Adsense or affiliate income through an affiliate program, understanding the best techniques and partners to maximize your income is valuable information. Maybe that book exists. But this isn't it.Make Money Online suffers from two fatal flaws. The first is that while it points you in the right direction, too often it seems as though the author thinks the reader is already somewhat familiar with a particular site or money making method and can read between the lines. While you might be able to glean enough to be able to search out what you're missing, that won't always be the case.For example, when talking about “PTC sites” which are sites that pay you to click on or view advertisements, he explains what they are and how they work, but doesn't give examples of any sites or how you might find them. The description was convoluted enough that I'm still not positive I understand, but think he is talking about sites like Swagbucks. Were I not aware of that site and how it functioned, I'd have had no idea what he was even talking about.Another example was in the discussion of advertising from Google Adsense in conjunction with Youtube. Among other things the advice was given to “tag with the right keywords” when uploading your video, but no indication of how to determine what those should be is given.The second issue, which I touched on above, is understanding what the author is trying to say. At one point I actually wondered whether the book was written in another language and translated using Google Translate because the grammar is so bad and the language often convoluted. However, the author uses too many idioms for that to be true. This paragraph is an example of the language used. It is representative, neither the best, nor the worst. I'll leave it to you to decide if it is acceptable.""Whether an educational program course, an expert course or any leisure activity that we needed to seek after, we would ask our companions or family to recommend a class in our neighborhood, if were not able to discover such a class, we would be constrained by the absence of accessibility to surrender the quest for our fantasies, interests or distractions.""I'd like to say that there is enough valuable information buried here that if you're willing to take enough time to parse the language that you'll find enough to make it worthwhile. I can't.

"On the radio, no one knows you're disabled. Born with “a whole range of birth defects,” Bob Foss was never able to walk without crutches. Yet from a young age he showed the talent to figure out how to accomplish his goals, refusing to let his physical challenges hold him back. After a stint at the college station at Stanford, Foss started freelancing for the UPI radio network with one of his first stories being the Patty Hearst kidnapping. He was hired by the network based on that work before they realized he was disabled.Kidnapped by Nuns and Other Stories of a Life in Radio tells a series of stories from Foss' life, most of which fall into three groups, although some stories could be categorized in multiple groups.The first kind of story is the “life in radio” part of the title. These focus on his duties and assignments as they changed over time, starting in the San Francisco area and moving back and forth across the country to Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, and DC.The second kind of story is Foss' take on particular stories he covered. As he explains early in the book, as a journalist he was required to be non-biased in his reporting. Now that he's retired, Foss can express his personal opinion, which he does, letting his thoughts creep in at times. Yet his explanations of stories and discussions of politicians from both major parties still felt non-partisan and balanced. His opinions were both good and bad about the stances of both parties and the people he dealt with, depending on the person and situation. It never felt like he had an ax to grind which made me feel his opinions could be trusted.The last type of story were about his travels, sometimes for work, but often not. Foss has been to all fifty states and numerous countries, both for work and on his own. I'm a fan of travel stories, but it was this group of stories I found the least entertaining. He chose interesting places to highlight, many that I wasn't familiar with and enjoyed learning about, but for me, something was missing from some of them. What that is, I'm still trying to figure out, but think it might be that they sometimes felt like too much of a recitation of the itinerary and failed to look at the bigger picture of how the experiences helped Foss grow.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"As a rule, I'm not a fan of self-help books. But I am a fan of John Vorhaus, having read and benefited from several of his books on poker nine or ten years ago and after getting an ereader, reading and liking a novel and one of his non-fiction offerings. His irreverent writing style and his humor keeps things light, while still being serious when the subject requires it. I was torn, so I decided to read a sample before making the decision to read this book, which I rarely do.The title of the first chapter, “where i get off,” (yeah, that lack of capitalization is a style choice) promised to address my biggest concern, as did the first few lines:""So, first question…Where the <heck> do I get off writing a book called how to live life?After all, I have no credentials in psychology, theology or any other –ology. Nor have I scholarship in philosophy, theosophy or any other –osophy. Indeed, I bear no academic qualifications of any kind, bar the lowly BA that got me my first job out of college and hasn’t done much for me since...""He then proceeds to make his case. If you're interested in the details, check out the sample. After having read the book, I have my own explanation.Do you have a friend or family member who is your go-to person for advice? They're non-judgmental. They may or may not have any expertise in the area you're struggling with, but by listening and asking questions they lead you (or sometimes actually help you lead yourself) to the right answers?To me, How to Live Life is the book equivalent to that person. A lot of life's bigger questions and the right answer for you (which is different than the right answer for me, or anyone else) comes from self-awareness. They come from figuring out what makes you tick. From your purpose in life and the things you're passionate about. Vorhaus asks the questions to help you focus on what the right answers are for you, rather than telling you what he thinks your answers should be. (Much different from many self-help books.) He'll give some of his answers, not claiming they're the right answer for you (many obviously aren't), but as examples to help you understand the questions better. You'll still want to go to that friend sometimes for advice (after all, their purpose and passion might be to help others), but we can all use more help, right?

"This was a fun, fast-paced read, as you want from a thriller. It also has a budding romance for an occasional change of pace and the main characters, Abel and Charlie, are easy to care about. Even the minor characters add to the story. Abel's ex-brother-in-law and long-time friend, Victor, not only adds to the story, but provides a bit of comic relief, as does Victor's side-kick, known as Cujo. However, it wouldn't be a thriller if there wasn't an antagonist or two shaking things up for the good guys. Yeager's Law has plenty of those, too. Maybe even bordering on too many.Which is as good of a segue as any into my concerns. All fiction requires suspension of disbelief to some degree. Things that we've learned to take on faith in fiction, we'd never believe if told they happened in real life. The thriller genre requires more of the reader in this regard than most other genres happening in the real world and contemporary times, so if you read a lot in the genre, as I do, you've learned to turn off your no-way-in-heck alarm while reading. Yeager's Law pushed me to the point where I was teetering on the brink of a full scale no-way attack, but I managed to avoid it. Barely.There were two reasons my ability to suspend disbelief was stretched almost to the breaking point. One is too many coincidences. The other is too many groups of bad guys. I can't even begin to explain without giving away too much. If you're prone to  saying, “bull-pucky, no way that could happen,” this might be too much for you.

"One time the boss walked into my office with a strange question (a trivial piece of information about one of the systems we were responsible for). I asked why he'd come to me looking for the answer and he responded, “because you know all kinds of useless, obscure crap.” Among my friends and co-workers, I've always been the person others would ask if they were trying to remember some long-forgotten tidbit of information. Rich Meyer's Five Star Trivia book proved I'm not as smart as they think I am.With 600 questions running the gambit from pop culture, movies, books, and even some academic subjects like science, geography, and history, this book should challenge even the sharpest trivia buff. The questions are well formed, giving you more than enough information to answer, if it is something you know and can retrieve. (That last part, I found difficult at times, knowing the answer was on the tip of my brain and after giving up, having to kick myself for not being able to retrieve it.)This is the second of Meyer's trivia books I've tried and, as with the first, my only complaint was not having an easy way to keep track of how I did. I knew I wanted to do this and rather than carrying a paper and pencil to make tick marks, I solved this by using the Kindle highlighting function to mark the correct answers, then counting them (in the Kindle's “My Clippings' document) at the end.

"It's a bit of a cliché that the protagonist in an author's debut novel often shares a lot of qualities with the author. Here, the protagonist, Anna, and author are both the ninth in a family with ten children. I suspect the author grew up in the Western suburbs of Chicago, probably about the same time as Anna, too. All of this means the details ring true. As the oldest in a family a touch smaller than Anna's, I can say that Oleszek nails the dynamic of a large family, both in how the siblings and parents interact and the differences in the experiences growing up for the younger children compared to the older.Getting the little things right matters, especially in a story like this where those minor details set up some of the major ones, how Anna reacts to the death of a sibling and how as a younger sibling she is overlooked, eventually resulting in much bigger problems. The majority of the story is how Anna eventually comes to terms with her sister's death in this thought provoking and enjoyable coming-of-age story.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"There's no lack of books out there to help with various aspects of a job search. There are a few things that set this one apart from others I've read in the past. One is length. It focuses on what's important without a lot of extraneous information or repeating things that could easily be found elsewhere. For example, you won't find page upon page of possible resume formats. But you will find discussion on what parts of the resume are critical, when it makes sense to depart from the norm, and an emphasis on what your goal should be when developing the resume or customizing it for a particular position.

"In a collection where an ode to the author's stalker doesn't seem strange or out of place, Odd and Odder seems like a reasonable title. The challenge is deciding which  parts of the collection are just odd and limiting those in the odder pile. (After all, they can't all be odder, can they?)That the authors got me to read poetry (something I normally steer clear of, unless you call it a song lyric, in which case I'm all over it), was an achievement not many have done.

"I've never heard the genre of a book described as epic political thriller. I'm adding that term to my lexicon now, because it is surely an accurate description of Four Seats. Epic in the sense of being long, two or three times the length of a typical thriller, but also in the sense of covering a lot of ground. Cooley has released the book as six bite size novellas as well as the complete series as one volume.I hate cliffhangers and had I been reading this as a serial having to wait for the next installment after being left hanging, I wouldn't have been happy. However, when read as one (long) book, this actually worked out well. With the book structured in six parts, it kept the pace fast and the tension mounting, not only in the short term, but also the long. I knew it was taking me a long time to read, but it never felt like it was bogging down.The story itself is wide ranging, with several different story threads that are all intertwined, another factor in keeping things fresh. At different times it read and felt like a political thriller, a legal thriller, and even a bit of a dystopian thriller. All of those thriller subgenres appeal to me.

"At first glance, Ashes of Life seems like a departure from the standard fare for either of the co-authors. Laura M. Kolar's previous output was a coming of age story with paranormal aspects aimed at the young adult audience. Erica Lucke Dean's books are erotic romances, co-authored with Elise Delacroix, and her solo efforts, which straddle the line where romance meets chick-lit. That first impression is both right and wrong.While Ashes isn't like what either author has done before, it plays to their strengths. Ultimately all of Dean's books that I've read, and as well as I can tell those from either author that I haven't, revolve around relationships, romantic and otherwise. Dean's books always show a sense of humor and, in spite of Ashes attacking some serious issues, that sense of humor still shows. (The relationship between the protagonist, Maddie, and her favorite barista along with her interactions with a handsome doctor who comes to her rescue more than once are a couple examples.)However, ultimately Ashes is more serious than the typical romance or chick-lit book. Like those, it has a budding romantic relationship that may or may not come to fruition. But also themes revolving around parenthood and duty with complex characters dealing with difficult situations. The authors may have been stretching their wings, but in doing so came up with an exceptional story which I highly recommend.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"When this book came across the transom it grabbed my attention, even though it isn't something I'd normally read. Yes, it's no secret that I'm an observer of the music business and got my start reviewing for music magazines and websites, but then it occurred to me that more than a few of my blog followers are indie authors. I've long felt that the publishing business has in many ways been on the same path as the music business, just five or ten years behind. There are some differences (mainly related to the time commitment to listen to a song compared to reading a book, and that music consumers will listen to a song many more times than a reader will re-read a book), but as a starting point to guess what might happen in publishing next, the music business is full of clues.This book could be viewed as a check list, with multiple potential avenues for promotion listed and somewhere from a paragraph or two to a few pages discussing how each might be used. Some of the specifics might be different, but with a bit of thought there is often an equivalent. (For example, the music streaming services like Spotify are the music equivalent of the book subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Scribd.) Several of the suggestions are promotional activities that I've seen used by authors.

"Keith Nixon has been a busy man with new books released in the last few months in both his historical fiction and crime fiction series, and now this one. It isn't clear whether The Corpse Role is a one-off or the first of a series featuring Detective Inspector Charlotte “Charlie” Granger, but I'm pulling for the second. (There are reasons why this could easily go either way. I won't discuss these since they are spoiler-ish.)The Corpse Role has two main time-lines, with the story switching back and forth between the two. The present, where the body of Paul Wheeler is found and Charlie begins her search for who murdered him and why, the second in the past where the events leading up to and surrounding Wheeler's death play out. Throughout the reader knows some things before Charlie figures them out, but seeing how it all fits together isn't always apparent, even when we think we know. Who is good – make that not as bad as others – is never clear, and keeps the reader guessing. I was also curious as to the significance of the title or if there even was any meaning.

"There are a couple of major themes that run through Skeleton Run. The first and most obvious, how skeletons in the closet can come back to haunt you. While many of us made mistakes when we were young and stupid, I trust few of us have skeletons as serious as the boys in this book. The other theme is money in politics, specifically by looking at what might go wrong with allowing the rich and powerful to have few restraints on political donations in the wake of the US Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision. The result is a fast-paced thriller with some entertaining twists, including an interesting way of tying the initial thread of the accident and the baby left behind to the more current timeline and political intrigue.

"This book is humorous while still feeling real, hitting the right notes on what it's like for a reasonably typical boy growing up. We follow the protagonist, Matthew Willard, from sixth grade until high school graduation, and his quest to kiss a girl. (If he gets one kiss, making out can't be too far behind.) Much of what Matthew and his friends went through gave me flashbacks of my school years many years ago.An example of the way a boy of a certain age thinks and the humor inherent in that is this line:“The best out-of-town girls where the ones from small towns, because they have limited access to boys they’re not related to.”The theory being that a hot small town girl visiting the state fair would be more likely to kiss Matthew or one of his friends, not realizing that he wasn't that great of a catch. Unfortunately this quote shows a minor instance of an issue that was widespread. Specifically, this book is in drastic need of copy-editing. Sometimes these errors made me laugh (a beautiful girl telling Matthew “put your hands on my waste” was one). More often it just irritated me as I tried to work out what was intended, just moving past one error and getting back into the flow when I'd trip on another. There is a fun story here, but unless you're much more forgiving of these types of errors than I am, it might not be worth the effort.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"Wikipedia says that suspension of disbelief “is a term coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a 'human interest and a semblance of truth' into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative.” To put this in a more simplistic way, write a good story, and the reader will willingly (probably subconsciously) play along with the parts they'd never believe in real life.At its heart, Fleischerhaus is a mystery. Actually two. The first is what is causing the protagonist Julia to have the flashbacks? Hallucinations? Whatever it is that happens when she visits the site of a former concentration camp feels like a memory of a past life, but her brain doesn't want to believe. I'd never believe this in real life, but while reading I was onboard from the start, not questioning it at all.The mystery of who Julia was in this past life was the first puzzle to be solved. (If they could verify the things she was feeling actually happened, then maybe she really was experiencing something from a past life. As those pieces started falling into place it setup another mystery, who murdered her in that prior life and was it too late for him to face justice? This was well written.

"This book has a lot going on. It's a thriller, with a mystery (how did Megan die) at it's heart, and has a bit of romance and a coming-of-age vibe to boot. Themes revolving around personal responsibility, redemption, family, and friendship setup some subtle lessons for the reader who notices while keeping up a quick pace and ratcheting up the tension if you just want a thriller.The point-of-view character alternates between John and Charley giving us different takes on what is going on as we get into the mind of each. I didn't have any issues keeping track of which character's POV was current, even in those rare chapters where each took a turn leading the way. Both John and Charley were appealing.

"I like the concept of this short book. The author interviewed about 25 successful entrepreneurs about the tools they use to manage their work and he found many used the same productivity apps which he discusses to help the reader Work Smarter. The book is short on purpose. As the author puts it:""This book is straight to the point. I didn’t see the point in drowning you into [sic] unnecessary details.""That quote segues nicely into the first of many complaints I had. The book was full of typos, grammar errors, and convoluted sentences. It was bad. In fact, it was atrocious. The number of these kinds of errors in this work of less than 6,000 words was two to three times what I’d find unacceptable in an 80,000 word novel. (Personally I’d find the frequency of errors here unacceptable in a Facebook comment.) These ran the gamut from the minor (the example above) to significant (one app was called Dashlane twice, then Dashboard two more times). All affected the readability.My second complaint is with structure. The first major section has the heading “Necessary” and presumably lists the apps that are most likely to be of value to most people. The two apps listed are discussed briefly in this section, but then keep popping up in other sections that cover other apps with functionality that overlaps these two. It left me wondering why they were necessary if the other apps accomplished the same thing or, if the “necessary apps” were the best, why list the others?Some apps were explained reasonably well, even if just in a short paragraph or two, in keeping with the theme of not wasting your time. Others left me wondering. For example, one app listed is Google Hangout. The entire explanation is “Google hangout is the replacement for Google talk.” If you’re unfamiliar with either app, is that going to inspire you to dig deeper?Last, one important piece of information was missing in the section for many apps, where do you go for more information or to obtain the app? If an app that runs on a smartphone (what platform an app is aimed at isn’t always clear), then you might reasonably surmise you can find out more and purchase them from the Google Play store for android devices and Apple’s app store for iOS devices. But for desktop or laptop computer apps, you’re left to your own devices.The one saving grace which I’ve rewarded by giving a sympathy star in addition to the minimum of one  is that Work Smart did point me to a couple apps I hadn’t heard of that appeared worth checking out.

"Where the Moon Shines Brightest is a coming-of-age story set in rural Southwestern Arkansas in the 1950s. In spite of my complaints which I’ll get to shortly, there is a good story here. The protagonist, Wallace (never Wally), is a teenager with ambition, hoping to attend college to become a journalist and author, and willing to work hard to achieve his goals. But like most teenagers, he’s also figuring out life. Helping him are his older brother and his parents, although his father has plans for Wallace that conflict with his personal goals. The two brothers are much different in what they’re looking for in life, but his brother Lantis is an excellent mentor and always has Wallace’s back. The story revolves around themes of family, duty, love, and geographical roots.However, I had two issues with the way Wallace’s story was presented. The first was a tendency to over explain or over describe. Although this can be a valid stylistic choice to add color or control pacing, too often it felt like the story was bogging down as I read all the steps required to get out the door or make breakfast. Other readers might not react the same (Robert Parker’s Spenser novels are prone to this, and they did okay).My bigger issue was the ending. Not what happened, but how the reader is told, and what that does to the pacing of the story. Things appear to be coming to a climax at about the 85% point, with a major story thread coming to a head. I turned the page, expecting that the next chapter would get more intense as that came to a final resolution. Instead what happened was a six year jump in the timeline and the fast pace comes to a crashing halt in a section that reads more like an epilogue. Through flashbacks we find out how the first thread resolved, another complication is thrown into the mix, and the pace builds again from there. Eventually the main story conflict comes to a resolution. But by that point, as a reader, I was so frustrated that it was more of an anti-climax.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

Sometimes I’m slow.)This is a fun, sometimes intense, adventure with God and his operations depicted as a large corporation (I’m not sure if this part is actually fiction), and appearances from a few biblical characters. Jude (you may know Mr Iscariot from his key role at The Last Supper) is given a chance at redemption, but his plans quickly go off the rails.

"Although Frank Dodge is the protagonist and narrator of Rock Island Lines, The Quad Cities (Moline and Rock Island, Illinois, Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa), play such a major role in the story that they’re almost characters, too, with the history of these towns playing as much of a role as Dodge in the story. If the author’s goal was for the reader to view this area as more than just a pit stop on Interstate 80 (my previous opinion), it worked for me.This is both the strength and the weakness of this book, depending on the taste of the reader. If the reader is fan of mysteries and also has an interest in history, this is an excellent choice. The historical aspects are integrated well with the overall story and don’t feel forced, but if your taste for history is limited, that aspect may be too much. Not knowing a lot about the Quad Cities when I began, I suspect those who are familiar might find even more to like than I did. I did appreciate the shout out to Greg Brown and William Elliott Whitmore, a couple of Iowa musicians who would be obscure to many, which led me to believe there could be other subtle touches that those more in the know would pick up that I missed.Although this is Klinkenberg’s first novel, he did a credible job. The only nit I have to pick is a minor tendency towards repetitiveness, but not so much as to be an irritant. I enjoy the character of Frank Dodge and since Rock Island Lines is billed as the first of a series I’m guessing we’ll see more of him in the future. Based on the author’s biography, I’m guessing we’ll see Dodge solving mysteries and introducing the reader to the history of other towns along the Mississippi.

"The story of Ghost Town Truck Stop is a simple premise. Strand a variety of people in a small town truck stop in the middle of Montana and get to know them, from pieces of their backstory, how they interact with their fellow strandees, and react to their situation. With many characters and multiple story threads, it would be easy for a reader to get confused in a book like this and experience difficulty keeping track of everyone and all that is going on. That wasn’t an issue for me. The author did a superb job of creating unique characters, each with distinct personalities, and keeping the various threads easy to follow. I found Ghost Town Truck Stop to be an enjoyable read with glimpses into small town life and the trucking game.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"From reading three of Caryn Rose’s previous books I know that I share one of her obsessions (music) while her other major interest (baseball), I don’t so much. However, despite two of the three books I’ve read having travel as a major component (one fictional, the other not), I didn’t pick up on her interest in travel, that I also share, until now. Early in Gas, Food, Wifi and the trip it chronicles Rose shared this insight, which really struck home with me:The last time I drove this route was over 10 years ago, and I am straining to find the familiar, the recognizable; for some reason I need to demonstrate that I know this part of the country, to remind myself that I am worldly and well-traveled, that I am larger than the day-to-day views of myself as a small person who goes to an office every day and does a small thing and then goes home. I am a person who has seen the world. Being able to say that and have it be true makes me feel less like a slave to the grind and more like a citizen of the planet.When I read travel memoirs, what I get out of them varies. There is the vicarious experience or sometimes comparing notes. The vicarious might be something I’m unlikely to ever experience (a couple travel memoirs from Japan I recently read), or as a preview for the future (at least some of the areas Rose traveled are places I’ve never been, but are on my list for the future, Cadillac Ranch, and the fabricated, but musically famous corner in Winslow, AZ for two). Other parts of Rose’s route are places I’ve been. A couple standouts for me are the Grand Canyon (pretty impressive for a big ditch) and the remoteness of Boise City in Oklahoma’s panhandle, a place I’d venture few have been.But more important than the itinerary, what makes or breaks a travel memoir is the personal. What did the traveler learn about himself or herself, the world, and their place in it? Without this, all you’d have is a travelogue, which I’d find boring. Gas, Food, Wifi is chock full of those, too, ranging from the paragraph I quoted above right up until the end when Rose summarizes what the trip meant to her and encourages her readers to “pick somewhere, rent a car, pick up a map, and start driving.” Her claim is that even without planning you’ll find things or “things will find you,” and even if that doesn’t happen, “the drive itself will bring you something.” From experience, I know she’s right.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"A reader who doesn’t get a sense of where this travel memoir is headed from the description surely will if they pause to consider the two quotes that proceed the prologue.“Every day some new fact comes to light—some new obstacle which threatens the gravest obstruction. I suppose this is the reason which makes the game so well worth playing.” --- Robert Falcon Scott (Died exploring the South Pole)“Adventure is the result of poor planning.” --- Roald Amundsen (Did not die exploring the South Pole)Barach chronicles plenty of adventure in this story of his pilgrimage. I hesitate to call it a pilgrimage as the choice of hiking this trail seems to be driven by the author’s obsession with Japanese culture more than any particular religious belief, but at its root, his goals for this trip were not all that different than a typical pilgrim’s might be. He describes this as “enlightenment,” which is going to be different for each individual, but will boil down to making some kind of major decision or coming to terms with some aspect of life. In Barach’s case, figuring out his future direction, not wanting to become an office drone, but also not seeing an alternative.I’m always drawn to travel books that involve a quest, some specific goal that might not mean anything to many people, but does to the author. This book fits, as would books from Amundsen or Scott (if he’d only survived to write it), as I think there is something to be gleaned from the story of the attempt, successful or not. I’m amused that at least part of Barach’s goal in this trip was to escape the repetitiveness of an office job, only to replace it by a trip that in many ways was just as repetitive, although with much more of a struggle to adequately satisfy basic human needs like food, water, and sleep. Does the author find enlightenment or come to terms with his future? I’ll leave it to you to decide. I will say that his journey was a positive step in life’s journey for me.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"I’ve read all of S.L. Baum’s books and liked most of them. The Deathtaker is my new favorite, taking over that position from Baum’s first book, A Chance for Charity. Part of that is I like being introduced to new characters, what makes them special, and the intricacies of the new story world. This book grabbed me immediately when the prologue gave us a sample of what makes Krista special and a glimpse of that quality at work. I quickly became invested in Krista, the difficulties her life’s work created for her, and saw what the main difficulty or conflict she was going to have to deal with in this story was going to be.

"As I was pondering what to say about The Body Market beyond the obvious (fast paced, blah, blah, blah) I was comparing and contrasting Leine Basso, the protagonist in this series, with Kate Jones, the protagonist in DV Berkom’s other series. (This is the third in this series while Kate Jones has seven volumes thus far.) Both can rightfully be described as kick-butt females, able and willing to mix it up with the bad guys as much as any man while still clearly being a member of the fairer sex. Each has a past that creates issues for them. However, these issues are much different. Kate Jones is the former lover of the leader of a Mexican drug cartel. Her ex and those associated with him keep popping up, causing problems. Leine’s situation as a retired assassin is much different, with her issues being largely internal, primarily guilt associated with her past, not only the things she did, but how it affected those around her.However, in this book Leine’s past seemed to be haunting her slightly less than in the first two books. Maybe she’s working past that and, since what she is doing now is definitely fighting evil, she’s feeling better about herself.The plot of The Body Market is easy to see as plausible with two older teens stretching their wings beyond what is prudent and having it backfire in a big way. When Leine tries to discover what happened, it makes for a fast-paced story (yeah, I know), that the more it developed, the more I wondered how it could ever come to a happy resolution.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"Graham Hope’s basic story is one that’s played out an innumerable number of times. A couple gets divorced and now both halves of the former couple have to figure out how to adapt to seeing their kids much less than before, new living arrangements for at least one, and how this is going to change their lives in other ways. Plus, you know, that sex thing (or lack thereof). It’s a story that’s been done before. (Most commonly in women’s fiction or chick-lit from the viewpoint of the female.)This basic story can take two directions, a serious look at the difficulties (those are the women’s fiction) or a more humorous take, which is where the chick-lit version typically comes in. Ben Adams takes the humorous route. At times farcical, yet never going so far that the underlying seriousness of the issues the protagonist Graham is facing are ignored.

"True crime books are an interesting genre in that they can cover different aspects of a crime or series of crimes: the actual crimes and community reaction, the investigation and identification of the culprits, or the legal battle from arrest to ultimate resolution, and sometimes the aftermath.Which parts get covered or the most focus varies and different readers will be drawn to different approaches. (An especially notorious crime spree can even generate multiple books with many of them selling well; for example, the plethora of books about Ted Bundy.)Joey 22 is the story of serial killer Joseph “Joey” Christopher, who targeted black men in New York State in 1980. As the author explains in the prologue, there were multiple serial killers targeting blacks across the country in this period and for a time it wasn’t clear whether they were related. (The mention of one of these who killed two black men just a couple blocks away from my home that same year grabbed my attention early.)While the crimes and investigation get some coverage, the majority of what is covered in this book is story of Christopher’s post-arrest trip through the legal system. For those who enjoy reading about legal maneuvering (yes, I’m one of those), it was an interesting read in that regard with some unique aspects to the case, specifically how he related to his primary attorneys in Buffalo and how that played out over time.However, there were also several technical issues that bothered me with this book. Although each one minor, the number of issues I saw that weren’t caught during proofreading and copyediting was enough to irritate me as were some random hyphens that shouldn’t have been in the ebook version. There was also a tendency to repeat background information that we’d already been told about earlier as well as give us background that arguably did nothing to enhance the story at hand. One example was a story about a judge who had been arrested. Although not important to the main story, it added a bit of color or characterization, so the tangent might be justifiable. However, later in the book one of the judge’s former employees who was arrested over the same incident made an appearance and we were treated to a repeat of the same tangent.This book will possibly appeal to some true crime fans, especially anyone from New York who remembers when these murders were happening. For others, it depends on your patience with tangents, repeats, and minor technical issues.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"I knocked a star off for falling short in applying the final polish on this novel with an overabundance of copyediting and proofing misses. (A couple issues that happened multiple times were confusing, such as ‘led’ and ‘lead’ as well as ‘road’ instead of ‘rode.’) But for those able to overlook or who just don’t notice those things, there’s a good story here. One I found interesting because it takes on one of today’s hot-button political issues.That issue (“common sense” gun laws) is one that (sorry, I can’t help myself) gets people up in arms, especially those on either extreme. Some would outlaw all guns except for possibly military and law enforcement while there are those on the other end of the spectrum who think it’s their absolute right (given to them by God and the constitution) to have a veritable armory complete with missiles and tanks in their front yard if they desire. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle with many polls indicating a majority of Americans believe that some moderate additional restrictions on gun purchase and ownership makes sense. For those on either extreme, this story isn’t likely to appeal. For those in the middle, it might.What I liked about the approach Ward took to telling her story is that while I had no problem suspending disbelief while reading it, there was never any doubt when I put it down that it was fiction. Nothing turns me off faster than a story with a political point to make that sacrifices story for preaching, even when I’m generally in agreement with their point. While A Spy Came home has a definite slant that would turn off extremists, the “good guys” weren’t always perfect and at least some of the “bad guys” have redeeming qualities as well.

"As I'm writing this it's late on 9/11, the ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Partly because the events of 9/11 figure into the plot, but more importantly because the actions of the government would have been unthinkable pre-9/11. ""No Good Deed"" is both entertaining and suspenseful, but, regardless of your politics, should get you thinking. Are the responses to 9/11 making the US a better or worse place to live? Do we really win when laws are passed making it easier to combat terrorists if it also lessens our rights? Shouldn't the idea of ""innocent until proven guilty"" still apply today?

"I’ve read a few books by John Vorhaus previously, but believe this is my first foray into his fiction. (The others were non-fiction, on poker and writing.) Even when writing with the primary purpose of informing, Vorhaus has a sense of humor that comes through. As you’d expect, when entertainment becomes one of the goals, the humor turns up a notch. That was true. As evidence I’ll point to the girlfriend who had sex with the protagonist to confirm that she was gay. While there is a lot of humor in the situations and the character’s reactions, Poole’s Paradise is not primarily a book of humor.Alexander Poole, the protagonist, is a college student, learning about life (he believes everyone in the world is his teacher, if he can figure out what lesson he can learn from them). He always wants to do the right thing (what that is, may not always be apparent), and he’s honest to a fault.

"You’ve heard the cliché that says “every story has already been told,” right? At a certain level of abstraction, that’s true. The specifics of character and plot may differ, but there are a limited number of basic stories. It amazes me how authors are able to put their own unique twists on a basic story and end up with something that still feels fresh and new. This goes double (or maybe quadruple) for the romance genre where every book is the same basic story.Following His Heart made me go “wow” in this regard. At its core, it is the basic romance. Girl meets boy, they take a romantic roller coaster ride fluctuating between, if not love and hate, at least dislike and like a whole bunch, then the happily-ever-after ending. There are minor characters that act as confidants and comedic foils for the heroine and hero, while giving the story more depth. (Primarily the heroine’s disabled mother, plus her best friends, Heather and Cathy.)But the twists, what set this story apart from a typical romance, is a strange turn the story takes that I’ve described as a combination of a little supernatural and horror-lite, although I’d be quick to say that romance readers who don’t normally gravitate to these genres shouldn’t find this too much of a departure from the norm to be objectionable.

"If I’m counting right, this is the third book I’ve read in the Rock & Roll Mystery series (this is the fifth book in the series). All have been solid efforts, including this latest installment. Jason Duffy, the protagonist in the series, is a musician, a one-time therapist although no longer practicing, giving up his practice to become a private detective. The musical backdrop is what initially attracted me to the series and I find the mystery portion of the books always hit the right notes, keeping me guessing, trying to figure out the solution along with Jason. But the part that stands out in this book, the aspect that struck me as unique, is an outgrowth of Jason’s past as a therapist.Part of that is an occasional insight informed by human nature that the typical person wouldn’t be expected to pick up on, but the biggest reason I feel this way is because of two characters who assist Jason, both of them former patients; Jeannine, Jason’s obsessive assistant, and Cory, a technical whiz who suffers from Tourette’s syndrome.

"Since this is the final book planned for this series (yes, I’m disappointed about that), it makes sense to first consider the series as a whole. I’ve loved the concept from the start. I’d describe the books as “loosely coupled,” in that they share characters (the members of a classics book club), but unlike a typical series where each book stands alone and shares characters (think in terms of a mystery or detective series), the Bibliophiles avoids feeling samey. (I know, not a real word, so sue me.) Yet each book is enough alike that they should all appeal to the same groups of readers. One obvious group is avid readers who have at least one thing in common to help them relate with the protagonist of each book.This installment focuses on Thaddeus, a straight-laced Anglophile, and Spring, the daughter of hippie parents. While more conventional than her parents, the free-spirited Spring is still influenced by her upbringing enough to be much different than Thaddeus. It’s a classic case of opposites attracting, with each learning from the other and in the process tempering their more extreme tendencies for the better.

"Fictional vampires have run the gambit from the garlic-dodging bloodsuckers who don't come out in sunlight to handsome and sparkly creatures, hanging out on the Olympic Peninsula.

Mostly set in the modern day, predominately New York City, the little touches and details the author integrates in the story are likely to resonate with fans of the art world and opera, yet I'm neither and still found much to enjoy.Beyond being an excellent story with some hot sex scenes, for those who like that, a clever and entertaining take on the vampire myth, and a love story, for those who look beyond the surface there is more. What does it mean to be human? Are some of the Earth's creatures more important than others? (Put another way, if it is okay for us humans to kill ""lower"" animals for nourishment, would the same logic justify ""higher"" creatures killing us for the same reason?) If you could live forever, would that be a good thing and what would you be willing to give up to do so? Marie grappled with all of these questions. After you read Blood Diva, maybe your answers will be the same. Or maybe not.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"The world Melody Curtiss imagined for the setting of this book is unique. The story is post-apocalyptic, yet unlike many books with that premise, the world isn’t lacking in technology or modern conveniences. At least not completely. Instead the area where the story takes place (what was formerly the North Western US) has areas that are settled, with all the things we have today and then some, and unsettled areas that don’t. The problem is, those more appealing areas also have laws that limit freedom, especially for women. It is essentially a dystopian world. Fighting against this system can have severe repercussions.The author describes the book as “feminist science fiction,” which is also an applicable label, as most of the significant characters are females, fighting to increase their rights in various ways. The protagonist is Sarah Rosen, a young feisty rebel. Will she be able to make a difference? I enjoyed finding the answer to that question, never sure how it was going to work out, but eager to see.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"The travel memoir or narrative has long been one of my favorite non-fiction genres. Part of that is the obvious. I love to travel and since being on the road all the time isn’t feasible, experiencing new places and things vicariously is an alternative. But it’s more than that. A good guidebook or the right internet site can take you to the same places. Besides that, the way you experience a place will be different than how anyone else does. (In fact, in some instances I’ll have been to some of the places myself and the vicarious experience is replaced by comparing notes, which was true for much of this book for me.)Books like this, what I describe as a travel adventure or quest, with a specific, usually difficult goal involved (in this case, riding a bike on roads and trails that roughly follow the Continental Divide of North America from well into Canada to the Mexican border) are also entertaining and interesting to me for other reasons. Getting a feel for the logistics of such an undertaking satisfies the curiosity of my more analytical side as does the problem solving involved when unanticipated problems come up.However, there is a third item that I find essential for a travel memoir if it is to hit the highest mark for me, putting the journey chronicled in the story into a bigger perspective. What did this experience teach the author about life, the world, and his or her place in it? It’s this area where The Divide excelled. In between the day to day adventure and problem solving, Doneen considers his life thus far and where he wants it to go from there, not unlike a coming-of-age adventure novel. But even better, it’s true.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"Xavier, the brother of the protagonist David, is the stereotypical computer nerd. He’s socially awkward and sometimes too logical by normal standards. I’m afraid I saw a bit of myself in Xavier at times. :) I even thought uCupid, his phone app to match people with their “soul mate,” wherever they might be, sounded like a great idea. The right data, analyzed the right way, can solve any problem, right? I’d sure like to think so.Of course, where Xavier (and I) fall short in our theory is that the typical human isn’t as logical as Mr Spock would like us to be. Human emotions and, yes, love is largely about emotions, aren’t always so logical. Love isn’t free … is funny, dark and thought provoking, with explorations of themes involving family, our obsession with (and sometimes over reliance on) technology, and yes, even love.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"Little Mouse is an interesting, thought-provoking read. The perspective of a Jewish family experiencing the horror of the rise of Nazi Germany, trying to make sense of what was happening and how to react, drew me in quickly. What they did and the sacrifices they made to survive by fleeing the country make up the first part of the book and setup the overall premise.However, once they escape and have begun to rebuild their life in Scotland, the war ends, and something happens that once again puts all they have built at risk. What they decide to do and how they accomplish it is the meat of the story. The decision of what to do was predictable, if not clichéd.

The Princess gave it high marks (a letter grade of A+) with the comment that she really liked it. She described it as having “a lot of fantasy” and a “moral about luck.”I concur. It’s a fun read that should hit the sweet spot for its target audience (ages 7-10) with a lesson to be learned (I’d describe it as “be careful what you wish for”), that comes through clearly, yet doesn’t overshadow the fun of the story.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"I will give Grace Burrowes credit for creating a male character who is very unusual in Regency Era literature and I will also give her credit for improving my vocabulary as there is some terminology used in this novel with which I was wholly unfamiliar.Unfortunately, I had some issues with choices that the author made in developing the characters.  I couldn't help but feel that Darius' choices didn't have to be as foregone as he made them.  I also struggled with the situation that brought Darius and Vivian together.  While the author is given credit for originality, the plotting just didn't come off as believable as I would have liked.Bottom line: I read Book 9:David first in this series.  It was quite good and was the catalyst for my purchase of the first book in the series.

"I came late to this series and read book 9: David first.  I won't repeat my review of that book here, but I found it to be well written and plotted with characters interacting in believable situations and facing realistic problems.  I wish I could say the same about book 2: Nicholas.Unfortunately, Nick was just weak and rather ridiculous when considering the resolution to the BIG PROBLEM that kept him from consummating his marriage to the heroine, Leah.  Her character was much more sympathetic and believable.  Leah's treatment by her father was horrendous and made me really feel for her.  Nicholas' character was just annoying.The writing didn't flow as well, the plot just seemed padded and Nick's real relationship to the secondary character of Leonie could be seen a mile away.

"Regency era romances, most romances in fact, follow a formula which goes something like this: handsome hero meets beautiful heroine, attraction occurs, but one or both of them is haunted by events in their past. Problems, exacerbated by often dubious misunderstandings, drive a wedge between them, one or the other of them is hurt/endangered, the H/h comes to the rescue, problems are solved, declarations are made and all's well that ends well for a final, romantic HEA.  Those elements, with the exception of the aforementioned dubious misunderstandings, are present in 'David: Lord of Honor.'So, what sets 'David' apart and earns it five stars from me?The short answer is the quality of the writing. The longer answer is the complexity of characterization.  The writing is very good in that it flows smoothly, balances engaging character dialog with the characters' internal musings that actually move the story along without being a rehash of what's already been said out loud.  The language used feels correct to the period and the plot, while not complex, is engaging.  For at least 60% of the novel, the reader is left to wonder if the H/h will actually be able to work out their problems.As to characterization, the reader comes to know Letty and David  at a fairly deep level.  Both are believably human, both have experienced believable sorrow and regret in their past lives that has shaped who they are when they meet  and both struggle believably, with their relationship.  Do you notice a theme here?Ms. Burrowes has done what so many authors can't or are unwilling to take the time to do: she has made the manners, mores and social strictures of the Regency Era an important CHARACTER in this story, but has done it in a very unusual way by putting the characters in a setting that is the antithesis of Regency Era propriety.  As a result, the social/moral conflict in this story feels real to the era and because of that the angst it produces also feels real and made this reader's heart hurt more than just a little throughout.Given her circumstances, Letty is understandably hard, but not calculating.  Given his upbringing and past experiences, David is understandably weary and heart sore, but not weak.  The secondary characters rise above window dressing to serve real purpose in enhancing reader knowledge of the main characters and help move the story along.Because I came to care deeply about these characters, I found the sex scenes to be some of the best I've read in this genre.  The first are achingly tender and beautifully described without being anatomically graphic.  As later intimate scenes occur, they become infused with a sense of near desperation as the obstacles between these two, especially those on Letty's side, rise to the near insurmountable.  The sex scenes do as much as the dialog to set feeling of growing despair and inevitable separation between these two.Is this novel perfect?  No.  David comes off just a shade too understanding and Letty just a bit too self-sacrificing but neither excess is so great that it will get in the way of rooting for them to be together. Also, I would have also preferred that the 'villain' of this piece have been more present through dialogue than being mostly just talked about. Finally, the act of violence that threatened Letty felt a bit contrived.  These are things I noticed as I read, but they didn't interfere greatly with my pleasure in the reading.Bottom line: There is a fair amount of angst in this story, but I found it believable and very, very satisfying.  I'll be reading more of Ms. Burrowes' writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3ALVGTAQ8L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FG9GUHW#wasThisHelpful","R2E3ALVGTAQ8L7","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I believe this author intended was something along the lines of the old Claudette Colbert/Clark Gable 'screwball' comedy, It Happened One Night.  Unfortunately, what should have been sprightly dialogue and humorous misunderstandings was little more than annoying prattling and plodding, repetitive action.  The heroine, Felicia, acts closer to 15 than nearly 21, the hero, Glen, Duke of Somerset, comes off as a Sir Galahad, solving all the heroine's problems while being simultaneously dim when finally being told the truth of Felicia's present circumstances.  The secondary characters are okay, but mainly function as window dressing.  A very contrived plot element involving kidnapping was included for no apparent reason than to introduce a new character into the story as it certainly didn't add any tension.If you are a fan of a Regency Era romances and have some care that the manners and mores' of the period be represented accurately, then you will likely be disappointed in Madcap Miss.  Forms of address are too casual the attention to the era's proprieties is very uneven.  To her credit, the author is fairly consistent with language, both of the upper classes/aristocracy as well as the patois of the working class. As far as the writing is concerned, the author struggles with continuity and phrasing (e.g. ""He noted an odd look in her tone.).Bottom line: ""Madcap Miss"" is a bit of a monstrous mess.  I did finish it, but can't recommend it when there are much better written and plotted Regency romances out there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJGJVAJEOAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QNXMMFO#wasThisHelpful","R2WJGJVAJEOAU","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fictional characters are woven into well-researched historical events to provide a story with good characterization, excellent setting and period description and gripping action.  Notorious Angel kept me interested from first to last even though I though the pacing bogged down from time to time.So why didn't I give it five stars?As another reviewer mentioned in her very well written reaction to the book, the heroine, Eleanora is held captive and raped by the hero, Grant, very early in the novel and that this kind of event was a familiar trope of 70s-80s romantic literature.  However, this sexual encounter isn't the highly romanticized  ""shy, reluctant-woman-resists-strong-domineering-male-when-she-really-loves-him""encounter.  They are virtually strangers, she's a virgin and it's just plain rape, ladies and gentlemen...rape.  He justifies his actions because she'd been traveling alone and keeping casual company with a prostitute.  Permission to rape by association,if you will.Yes, I know that women were considered little more than intelligent cattle during the period of this novel (1850s) and that women of that era, conditioned to the dominant preeminence of men, may not have had quite the same reaction as a woman today might.  That said, Eleanora's reaction to the rape still troubled me.  She seemed to 'get over it' too quickly on her way to falling in love with Grant.  It never seemed to be an issue between them and was never mentioned again until later in the novel when a Grant asks her if she betrayed him because of ""what he did."" Honestly there were many occasions of ill treatment on his part that it's hard to know if he was referring to the rape in that circumstance.Bottom line: the book is well written, the history is fascinating, and the plotting is gripping.  I just couldn't connect with either Eleanora or a Grant and I just wish the whole rape sequence had been left out or treated differently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHIEI3IYH2Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A97YTE2#wasThisHelpful","RZHIEI3IYH2Q5","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heroine, Penelope, spent too much time wringing her hands about how she didn't 'fit in' to the ton and how much she wanted to go back to the country and her botanical studies.  I found her unbearably whiney. She never did find her spine with her aunt, who treated her abominably, or Drake, the so-called hero of this piece.Drake was basically a twat.  He would acknowledge his 'twat-ness,' straighten up for about 3 or 4 pages, then go back to being a twat.  If I read one more time how he needed the 'perfect duchess,' I thought I would scream, especially considering the reason he wanted said duchess.  A secondary character in the form of Lady Daphne started out as a good rival to Penelope for Drake's attentions, but then she just fades away.Bottom line: The characterization is shallow, the main conflict is shallower, the 'chemistry' between Penelope and Drake is shallower still.  The author phoned this one in.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXVST6OPF6VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6ZJ6GK#wasThisHelpful","R1YXVST6OPF6VH","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many things to like about this book.  The dialog is often funny, both main characters, Abby and Kipp are likable, the secondary characters, especially Brady, Kipp's best friend and Abby's co-conspirator are fun and funny, and the plot is reasonably believable.  The ending was satisfying once you got past one relatively inane complication on Abby's part.  That is sufficient good news to allow me to give a measured recommendation.The bad news is that the editing is poor and the author has continuity issues.  There were enough poor and unintended word choices, suddenly appearing characters and misplaced dialog to distract from the reading.  Kasey MIchaels, according to her own end notes is the author of 110 books.  I don't know where this novel falls in her writing career but there really is no excuse for the kind of errors littering this book.  I suppose that some of it might be attributed to the conversion of the print version, originally published in 2001, to the digital version published in 2014.

"Shallow character development, slow pacing, and poor editing are all wrapped up in a prosaic 'the prince and a commoner' storyline with liberal doses of not-very-hot sex.That's my one line review of this novel.  I stopped at the 60% mark because I got tired of reading essentially the same basic dialog over and over again.  Both the writing and the plot are amateurish with characters who range from juvenile (Clara) to unlikable (most every other character).The hero is deeply troubled and wears a t-shirt to bed (sound familiar?).  He makes frequent references to 'control,' BDSM and how 'dangerous' he is.  The danger comes in the form of violent nightmares and The mention of BDSM were mostly silly references to spanking.  I think the author meant this to be a way to build tension but for me, it just became annoying.Probably the most aggravating aspect of this novel is that the story's  Prince is a son of the British Royal Family.  There's a danger in that because this reader's natural tendency is to think of the real Royal Family.  That being the case, much of the action and dialog (what there is of it) comes off as unbelievable.Bottom line: this novel aspires to be a 50 Shades with its hints st BDSM.  It isn't.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJ77BNNEC0MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5CASSM#wasThisHelpful","R3QJ77BNNEC0MJ","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first 60%: Bitchy, spinsterish woman writes a pamphlet critical of the profligate ways of the local rake.  He shows up to see who she is and  verbal sparing ensues.  Bear in mind that this is the same rake who won her family home in a card game and who she wants to loan her money to return it to profitability.The next 20%: Allusions to a BIG SECRET in the woman's past stand between the developing relationship between the spinster and the rake.  She wants him, he wants her, but she's afraid he will hate her once he learns the BIG SECRET.The last 20%: The BIG SECRET is revealed and you must be prepared to totally suspend belief to make it work.  There were so many illogical elements to this entire story that I just couldn't suspend belief enough to care how it ultimately ended.Bottom line: This was too much like a soap opera story line for me because of the often illogical actions and vacillations of the heroine.  The hero wasn't much better as he would often get fed up with the heroine, tell her off, storm off in a huff and then would come trouping back for more.  The pacing in the first part of the novel was incredibly slow and the BIG SECRET wasn't worth the effort and time it took to find out.

"While reasonably well written, there is nothing original or very interesting about this book. Is's been a while since I read a vampire novel, but I remember all of the stock elements and they are all here: the devastatingly handsome alpha male vampire leader, the beautiful, strong, spunky, often poor decision-making human female, powerful sexual attraction between the two of them leading to copious amounts of sex, and the various elements of vampire lore that are stock-in-trade for novels in this genre.As for the supposed attraction between Raphael and Cyn (Cynthia), I didn't buy it.  It starts with her having vampire induced wet dreams and continues with what appears to be Raphael's mind control along with significant infusions of his blood.  This was a theme addressed in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery series and was an understandable source of doubt and distraction for that series' main character, Sookie Stackhouse.  Cyn is considerably more sophisticated and accomplished than Sookie, but for some reason, this doesn't appear to concern Cyn and don't think it's because she's any smarter than Sookie.Bottom line: Nothing new here. To the author's credit, the central conflict of the story is resolved in this book, but the relationship between Raphael and Cyn is left to the sequel.  I'm not interested enough to find out what that might turn out to be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKZY7UV36M5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPZ1O6#wasThisHelpful","R3FKZY7UV36M5T","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About fifty percent of this book is slow-moving and tedious especially since it is told from two perspectives, that of Olivia and True.  While the author does a better job than some with this double perspective, I still found it repetitive.  The best written parts were True's flashbacks to his abandonment and tumultuous fight for survival as a feral child essentially raised by animals.I never understood Olivia's passivity with regard to the members of her family who seemed to go out of their way to criticize and demean her. I know that women weren't as likely to speak up for themselves during this era, but her meekness seems extreme to me.  I really didn't understand the motivations for two of her three marriages and I didn't completely understand why she held herself apart from True quite as long as she did.  In short, Olivia's character didn't make a lot of sense to me.The pace last half of the book picks up with a couple of revelations and a little mystery.  I suppose what put me off was what felt like an abrupt ending.  As long as it took to develop the relationship between True and Olivia it was almost as if the author got tired of writing and wanted the book to just end.  I have to say that the suddenness of the ending and the unemotional nature of it left me flatly disappointed.Bottom line:  I liked the character of True, found Olivia fairly uninteresting and was left with a strong feeling of dissatisfaction when the story ended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SYCALJKMY7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRO428S#wasThisHelpful","R31SYCALJKMY7P","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While still a good read, The Orphan Pearl did not reach of the same level of 'wonderfulness' as the two previous books in the series.  While the conflicts plaguing Caro and Adam in 'The Secret Heart,' and Sophie and Julian in 'The Lover's Knot' were believable, I struggled with the conflict at the center of this book.  I found that there wasn't much to attract me to the female protagonist, Lady Lily Spark. Lady Lily's disappearance and presumed death is at the heart of Adam's angst in The Secret Heart,  but she reappears to become the focus of this book along with the male protagonist, John Tacitus Ware.  Frankly, I found her spoiled with self-serving attitudes that were both annoying and dangerous.  I also felt that John Ware's character was not quite as well developed as were Adam and Julian in the previous two books.As wonderful as the first two were, this book just didn't have the same level of cohesivness as the first two and I found myself more conscious of the effort it took to read it than I did with the first two.  With those, the time flew by, with this one I was more willing to put it down.  The author does provide much more historical background in this book in the form of the beginnings of the ultimate collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but I didn't find that particularly instructive or interesting.Bottom line:  If you've read the first two books in this series, you need this one to round out some of the stories of the other characters, but you may find it is not quite as good as the previous two.  There is a fourth book coming that will tell the story of Lord Kingston, probably the most angst-ridden and, to this point, despicable of the continuing characters.  He has intrigued me and I look forward to reading more about him.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162JN38C1J3JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WIMBGEW#wasThisHelpful","R162JN38C1J3JW","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first book in this series, The Secret Heart was excellent and met nearly every requirement I have for a fully realized, deeply engaging book.  It has a place on my keeper shelf.  So does the second book in the series, The Lover's Knot, the story of Julian and Sophie.Ms. Satie is a remarkable author who writes period romances with themes that resonate in the today's world.  There was more of a mystery in this book and the internal struggles of the heroine, Sophie, with regard to her relationship with Julian, would be instantly recognizable to many modern women today.  The hero, Julian is not above manipulating people to get what he wants, but I couldn't help liking him.  I also liked that the Earl of Kingston, an important secondary character in Secret Heart, showed up in this book, albeit briefly.I did feel that the plot meandered a bit more than necessary and the secondary characters weren't as fully fleshed out as in the first book.  However, they still served to add interest and texture to the plot.  There also wasn't quite the surprise twist to the mystery as there was in the first book.Bottom line: The few criticisms aside, this is a very good book.  The main characters are fully fleshed out, the plot conflicts are heartbreaking, the road that Julian and Sophie travel to find one another is long, arduous and very satisfying once the destination is reached.  Be advised that this author does not shy away from sex in her novels, but this is the first novel I've read in quite a while where the sex is integral to the H/h's relationship and not just something to titillate and sell novels.Final note: Even though each of the first two novels can stand alone, I recommend that you read the series in order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0AUJ4Y1DRPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJISVF8#wasThisHelpful","R2E0AUJ4Y1DRPM","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Too often, stories set in this period are fixated on the relationship between beautiful people who face some problem or obstacle that is too easily resolved in an unsurprising HEA.  In other words, most books in this genre follow a formula that grows old with repetition.  'Secret Heart' has many elements of that formula, but the deviations are noteworthy and create a story that is engaging, believable and thoroughly entertaining.More than anything else, this is a story of rebellion for both characters.  For Caro, the story highlights just how few choices most women had during this era had and just how much they were at the mercy of the men in their lives: fathers, brothers, husbands.  Because Caro is determined to not be a victim of her dissolute father and brothers, she often manipulates those around her. As a consequence, she is a substantial departure from the typical Regency era heroine.  You may not like her at times, but you  will likely understand why she acts the way she does.  She is one very focused and determined lady which makes her relationship with Adam one that was intended to solve the problems of her future, but instead becomes one that endangers her sense of self.  One of the most heartbreaking scenes I have ever read is when Caro realizes that in loving Adam, by allowing him to love her, she is giving up some of the control of her life that she has fought so hard to attain. She fears being 'owned and powerless.'  Without giving up too much of the story, the way that the author chooses to show her realization, in a moment that should have been euphoric, is at once chilling and heartbreaking.For Adam, his chains come in the form of his title and the expectations and disdain of his cold, controlling and autocratic father.  Adam would appear to have all of the advantages of title and position but because of past events he labors to break free of the strictures imposed by his position and his guilt.  I have to say that there were times that I did not care for him and found him weak.  It was because I felt that way about him but still found myself wanting him to find happiness that I knew that Ms. Satie is an author to watch.  The only criticism that I have of this novel is the major event that figures large into Adam's angst which is the disappearance and presumed death of his sister.  I never quite understood the assumption that she is dead but, given the time period,  I guess that would have been the conclusion that most would have drawn given that she was never found.The most original aspect of this novel is the direction of Caro's and Adam's respective rebellion.  As a gentlewoman, Caro's choice of ballet and Adam's choice of boxing as the tangible expressions of their rebellion stands out as notable exceptions to the traditional formulaic historical romance.  Because both characters see themselves at the mercy of their circumstances, their avocations become the one thing that they can control.  The author's descriptions of Caro's seeming automatic lapse into the essential ballet positions when stressed and Adam's immersion into the violence of boxing as a release for his considerable frustrations are, at once, beautiful and compelling.Secondary characters are well developed and interesting.  Daphne, Adam's cousin and Caro's friend is a quiet, but strong voice of reason for these two and would make and interesting character for a book of her own.  The Duke of Hastings, Adam's father, doesn't make an appearance until late i the novel, but he is frightening in the depth of his efforts to manipulate the course of his son's life.  The depths to which he goes to bring his son to heel have tragic consequences.  Lord Kingsley and Adam have a complicated past that is only partially revealed near the end of the novel, but I think I'll probably see more of him in subsequent novels.  Giselle, a professional ballerina who became mistress to Caro's father and served as governess to Caro was one of the architects of Caro's attitudes toward life.  Each of the secondary characters is interesting in their own right and make for richly textured story.Bottom line: There is nothing 'fluffy' about this book; there is very little flirtatious banter and no extensive description of clothing, balls or homes.  What you get instead, is a beautifully told story of two people who seek to be in charge of their own lives.  In order for me to become really immersed in a book, I have to believe in the characters and the situations in which they find themselves. These characters felt believably human to me and I rooted for their HEA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TH30KTTRFSN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PA0EE8E#wasThisHelpful","R2TH30KTTRFSN3","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thoroughly dislike stupid heroines and Cele, the female protagonist is just that.  I get that she was hurt by a man in the past but when she continually makes critical decisions based upon that I can help but dislike her.  It makes me want to shout, ""open your eyes, grow up, move on."" Why the hero, Dahleven continued to stick with her and make excuses for her,  I'll never understand.  It's one thing to be stupid for a time but to persist in it the way Cele did tried my patience.  There are few books the get the dreaded DNF, but this one did at the 90% mark because I simply didn't care how the author wrapped it up.As for the writing, it's adequate, at best.  Since this is a work of fantasy, it's incumbent on the author to do some world building.  She does that but I didn't feel especially drawn to this world.  The pacing was plodding and there were too many mental 'asides' by the characters.  I give the author credit for effort in originality.  Unfortunately that was over shadowed by a dull plot.  There was only one character that I liked and that was Sorn, but he died fairly early in the story.  Lucky guy.Bottom line: At best, the book is boring, at worst, it's annoying.  I cannot recommend it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQ19MAFNW4Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QQ1CDK#wasThisHelpful","R1NQ19MAFNW4Z3","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though 'His Wicked Reputation' starts a bit slow it builds to a decent, if abrupt ending.  I suppose that since this is the first book in the Wicked Trilogy, the author did not feel compelled to tie up certain loose ends like who killed the oldest brother, whether or not all the missing art work was found and whether or not Eva, the heroine, will face legal consequences for art forgery.  All that said, the H/h of this story do have enough of a HEA that you may find yourself on the fence about buying the next book in the series.Be advised that the sensuality rating on this book would run about a seven on a scale of ten.  While I don't mind sex in the books I read, I prefer it to be a bit more 'organic' as they say these days...a natural consequence of building sexual tension.  There was one time in particular that the sex felt more crude than romantic which is a substantial turn off for me.Bottom line: this book is not bad, but neither is it great.  The jury is out as to my decision on buying the next in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TPKZ8LLDID1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGK420#wasThisHelpful","R3TPKZ8LLDID1J","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trite dialog, alternating POVs between first person to third person, use of present tense In 3rd person...all of these are things I can overlook or adapt to if the characterization is good and the story interesting.  Unfortunately that was not the case in 'Geoducks.'The two main protagonists are uninteresting, the female secondary character does nothing but try to push her best friend in to having sex with the neighbor, the old boyfriend...whoever she can think of.  I found myself very easily distracted while trying to plow through this book and putting it down often.

"It was free and described as funny, so I 'one-clicked' it as the author describes e-book purchases.  That's the good news.While the author's premise offered promise and was the primary inducement for selecting this book, I found that I didn't care for the writing.  Both the dialogue and the main character's internal musings are meant to be breezy and witty but I found them juvenile and dull. What humor is to be found is cloaked in liberal use of the 'F' word.  Understand that it is not the word that I have issues with, it's that its too frequent use points to a general lack of sophistication in the writing.Bottom line: The negative reviews are right about this one: promising premise, poor execution.

"And that is because Ms. Bennet's  basic storyline doesn't seem to vary.  In the two books of hers that I've read, the male protagonist is emotionally damaged but is ultimately saved and redeemed by the love of a strong woman.  If the surrounding details of the plot were more interesting it might be bearable but, alas, that is not the case.  They are entirely predictable.As far as her writing style is concerned, I'll levy the same complaint that I levied in my VERY critical review of the first book of hers that I read which was 'Alex: A Cold Fury HockeyNovel.'  As in that book, each chapter is an alternating POV between the male and female protagonist.  I really dislike this device because I find it amateurish and distracting.  Many fan fiction authors who write for free can do better than that.You may be wondering why I would choose to purchase and read the work of an author whose work I so roundly criticized.  Since I read a great deal I sometimes forget authors I've read before.  I was sucked into 'Make it a Double' by the synopsis and the number of 4-5 star reviews.  While I'll say I liked the characters in 'Double' better than 'Alex,' this will be the last of her books that I read.

"So many Regency Era romances follow a tried and true, if hackneyed, formula.  The Perils of Pleasure is anything but typical or formulaic.  It is a deep breath of fresh air in a genre burdened with over sexualized tripe.The male protagonist, Colin is a young London rake making his march  to the gallows for a crime he didn't commit.  Fortunately he is saved quite dramatically by Madeleine, a woman hired to choreograph his rescue.  The successful rescue sets off a series of adventures, discoveries and resolutions that are surprising, intriguing, inventive and original.Apart from a few formatting errors, this is one of the best stories in this genre I've read in a long, long time.  There is humor, intrigue and great poignancy.  The main characters are likable and sympathetic as they grow and develop throughout the story. The intrigue is well developed and unpredictable and the plot twist at the end was truly surprising.  The ultimate resolution for our two main characters was by no means assured but was ultimately, deeply satisfying.Be advised: there are two fairly graphic sex scenes between the two main characters, but rather than being gratuitous sexual interludes, I felt them to be a natural element in their developing relationship.  In my opinion, the scenes were not included to heighten prurient interest but to show character and relationship development and as such are some of the best I've read.Bottom line:  If this is a sample of Ms. Long's prowess as a writer, I will happily read more of her work.  Well done, Ms. Long, very well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PXKIGTVGMM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZJQ96#wasThisHelpful","R17PXKIGTVGMM2","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only conclusion that I have some to is that I felt like I was being 'told' about this couple and their trials and tribulations rather than being engaged with them as the story went along.  It was kind of like being introduced to someone who is perfectly likable, but who does not inspire you to seek further acquaintance.

"The Madness of Viscount Atherbourne contains all the necessary ingredients for a satisfying romance: a dashing, devastatingly handsome but tortured male protagonist, a beautiful, kind and loving female protagonist, a revenge plot, a not too surprising plot twist, good character development, and a hard fought for HEA.  Some authors take these elements and create a really good story that clips along and others, with all those same elements create drudgery.  I am happy to report that Ms. Braden's efforts fall into the former rather than the later.For me, the characters' actions need to have some logic behind them, the plot complications need to feel believable, the characters need to develop and grow over the course of the story and the ending needs to make sense.  Happily, this story and its characters make sense, is well written and absorbing and the ending made me cry.  One of the highlights of this book is the character development, especially that of the the hero, Lord Lucien Atherbourne.  The cause of his tortured angst is completely justified even if his method of revenge seemed a little far fetched. However, I felt that the characterization of the heroine, Victoria, was a bit weaker.  It took her a little too long to to find her spine, but not so long that I lost patience with her as I so often do in romance novels.  There are some interesting secondary characters who make significant contributions to the story.  I especially liked the Greek chorus like comments of  Lady Wallingham found in the chapter headings.  They were pithy, humorous and set a slightly more sophisticated tone than what is often found in Regency Era romance novels.Bottom line:  You may find that this story drags a bit through the first half, that Victoria shouldn't have been surprised as she was at the depth of Lucien's commitment to revenge, and that she gives in a shade too often to sexual attraction when she shouldn't, but you will also find that this is a very well written book.  I'm pretty sure that you'll care about the characters and you'll be invested in their achieving a happy ending.  In short, it's worth your time and your money.  Now I'm off to get the second book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TAME0MGH712/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RUAFXGO#wasThisHelpful","R15TAME0MGH712","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Misunderstandings and deception, well meaning or otherwise, are the stock and trade of romance novels.  Used effectively they create delicious tension that ultimately ends in a satisfying HEA.  Used gratuitously as they were in Christian's and Jessie's story and you get a boring, repetitive story that is a test of this reader's will to finish.The premise that was used to set up the meeting of Christian and Jessie was far-fetched and unbelievable.  Their constant on-again/off-again relationship was trying and went on entirely too long before the inevitable HEA.  Both characters are hypersensitive and very quick to misinterpret each other's actions which leads them to cycle through attraction/lust/loathing/despair and tears so often that I became impatient with the characters and the story.Bottom line: there is no depth to this story and I didn't feel compelled to wade through Cutter's story which is also contained in this edition.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZ6V8OQZ27WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXIK0DQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CZ6V8OQZ27WG","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Lady of Deception: a weak 3 stars.  The story began well with an interesting premise and good pacing.  Unfortunately, about 40% of the way in, with the first major conflict resolution, the story devolved into an overblown melodrama of guiltily kept secrets and handwringing angst.  There is mild tension in the Irish Revolt plot.  With regard to characterization, it took Georgina too long to find her spine and Adam's highly developed sense of betrayal turned him into an unnecessarily nasty piece of work.  The inevitable HEA was a little to saccharine for my tastes.Bottom line: with a little better editing and a lot less melodrama, this could have been a heck of a good story.Netherworld: a solid 3 stars.  With a plot and main characters that are very similar to those found in Dark Deceptions, Netherworld moves us backwards from the English Regency Era to 12th century Wales complete with damsels in distress, knights in shining armor and wet, gloomy castles.Instead of a single heroine, we have a pair of young women being brutalized by a family member who find love in the arms of their rescuers.  The good news is that Chrystobel and Islyn have somewhat better self esteem and are generally spunkier than poor downtrodden Georgina in Dark Deceptions.  The male protagonist Keller is also more forthright, focused and goal oriented in spite of some understandable previous heartbreak.  As a consequence, I liked him a good deal better than whiney, suspicious Adam in DD.Bottom line: Netherworld is an big improvement over a Dark Deceptions with much less angst, much more action, and more appealing characters.Final word: Be advised that the last 10% of this book billed as 'bonus material' is actually single chapter teasers for other books written by the authors.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCDGPT76CXM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNGNVIO#wasThisHelpful","R2BCDGPT76CXM4","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You'll have to decide for yourself whether or not it's fair to review a book before the reviewer finished it but, try as I might, I could not make myself read to the end of this one.  Just over a third of the way into this I found myself skimming...never a good sign.  While I can't complain about the cost (it was free), I do value my reading time.The title tells you this is a Scottish time travel romance.  Unfortunately, the author tried way to hard to pull off the time travel aspect of it to the point that it felt unnecessarily contrived and silly.  Where Diana Galbadon's time travel method was surprising and smoothly integrated into the story, this one was clunky and overdone.  It required entirely too much buildup.Once our heroine makes the big time jump, her actions, even with her belief that 'it's all a coma-induced dream' make little sense and are not believable: readily adopting a Scottish accent, happily marrying her hunky 'Coma Husband,' kinda' having sex with him then making out with his brother, etc.  Needless to say, she acquiesces to her surroundings very quickly.  As for our hero, even though I read fully 1/3 of the novel, he is so little known that it's hard to feel much for him.  Absolutely nothing about either character 'grabs' me.Bottom line: All romance novels follow the same basic formula leading to the required HEA.  The only thing that sets one apart from the others is the quality of the plot, including the conflict, and character development.  One third of the way into Love Beyond a Time there is no believable, sustainable tension and the characters haven't interested me.

"The female protagonist, Shannon, is one of the most hapless characters I've ever read and that haplessness plays out in a wasteland of frenetic slapstick that was only occasionally funny.  The sheer volume of falls, social blunders, embarrassing objects that fall out of her purse or pocket is ridiculous and conversations about her personal hygiene and parents' sex lives is frenetic and overwhelming.  The author does have a good sense of the female psyche especially as it relates to how we see ourselves reflected in the eyes of the men in our lives, but the few insightful nuggets related to that is lost amidst frequently unfunny nonsense.What dialog there was was subsumed in a sea of the heroine's internal dialogue.  I realize that dialogue is much harder to write than just straight prose, but it certainly makes for a much better pacing and a much better read.The repeated use of 'overwhelm' as a noun rather than a verb or adjective, to whit: 'I’m shaking with overwhelm, adrenaline, embarrassment, and excitement.'  It can be used that bit is is awkward and distracting.Bottom line: This author's simply tried too hard to make Shannon's misadventures funny which is unfortunate because the author does seem to have a handle on some aspects of the female psyche that are at once funny and sad, painful and uplifting.

"Ms. Day provides what so many others lack in a period romance novel: good characterization, wonderful pacing, an intriguing plot, realistic complications and a believable conclusion.  To be sure, the red herrings did little to throw me off, but the mystery element was still good.Her characterization of Eliza who has ordered her life to be the antithesis of her willful, flighty mother, is a study in how the influence of our parents, for good or for ill, is always with us.  She is one of the few female protagonists whose 'hangups' felt believable and integral to the story.  As the protagonist, Jasper Bond's parental motivations and influences were not quite as well developed until the very end of the novel but, in the end,  no less compelling.  The only criticism I have of his characterization is Eliza's oft repeated musing as to his physical beauty.  I got it after the first several mentions.Be advised, as with all of Ms. Day's novels, the sensuality rating is very high.  From the middle of the novel until the end, the sex is frequent and graphic.  That said, there is a tone to this story that is more deeply romantic than I have perceived in her some of other novels.  It's not just about the sex.  Eliza's and Jasper's growing and deeply emotional connection fills a void that neither of them understood or were aware of until the other filled it.  That's what makes Pride and Pleasure a cut above most other period romances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33B20WXNQ5WDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPS5VHI#wasThisHelpful","R33B20WXNQ5WDL","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read a great deal and I often choose period romances, most of which have a predictable plot arc:  boy meets girl, boy and/or girl have issues of one kind or another, boy and/or girl feel attraction but some misunderstanding drives them apart, dramatic circumstances throw them back together, misunderstandings are overcome, happily every after is achieved. I am thrilled to say that while most of those plot elements are present in Courtney Milan's ""The Heiress Effect,"" there is such originality in characterization, real tension in the development of the plot and no guarantee that a HEA will be achieved which makes this a book in which very little is predictable or typical.  In fact, I would describe this book as being one of the BEST I've read in the period romance genre.Characterization:  Attractive, but bespectacled, serious and ambitious young man, Oliver Marshall meets abrasive, plump, over loud in both speech and dress, Jane Fairfield.  From the jump, these two are non-typical.  Both are the by-blow of aristocratic parents and both have had their adulthood informed by the fact that they are 'outsiders' and the emotional baggage that they carry is both realistic, relatable and heartbreaking.  The difference is that Oliver has worked diligently to suppress his natural tendencies in order to 'belong' so that he might make a difference to many (the politically and economically disenfranchised) and Jane has worked frantically and forwardly to alienate many so that she might make a difference for one (her half sister).  To say that Oliver and Jane are initially oil and water is an understatement but somehow they recognize something in the other that they need.Plot tension: This novel is really three stories beautifully woven together with plot elements that are also very non-typical for the genre: Jane's story which shows her to be loud, badly dressed, ill-mannered and abrasive;  Oliver's story where he is principled, but frequently wavers in his ability to stay true to his principles and finally the story of Jane's half sister, Emily Fairfield a sheltered young woman who suffers from what is likely temporal lobe epilepsy.  Poor Emily's condition is worsened by the guardianship of an uncle who is incredibly cruel in his well-intentioned and earnest, if ill advised efforts to protect and 'cure' Emily's affliction.  Interestingly, there is also a member of Oliver's family who suffers from agoraphobia and it is this family member who provides the catalyst for the HEA which was by no means assured throughout much of this novel.The 'happily ever after:'  Authors often try to write strong women but few succeed.  You may have a different idea of what a strong woman is, but for me a strong woman is one who knows who she is, what she wants for herself and those she cares about and who follows both her heart and her instincts with truth and dignity.  Jane Fairfield is all of those things and more often at great cost to herself.  One of the best scenes I've read in recent memory is the one in which Jane tries to talk herself into becoming the bland, unassuming, aristocratic help-mate that Oliver believes he needs to have the kind of political career that he wants.  Fortunately that self-talk is short as she realizes that she is  finished with playing a role.  She tells Oliver, ""It's just as well that you don't want an 'awful' wife,"" she told him, ""because I had hoped for a husband with a little courage.""  Given what the reader has learned about Jane and Oliver to this point, that is a devastating thing for her to say and an even more devastating thing for him to hear, but it is a dead-on accurate testament to Jane's strength and courage.  After this, Jane walks away and proceeds to begin the process of building a life for herself without Oliver.  Jane is no shrinking violet.Bottom line: This is a terrific book that looks not only at the developing relationship between Oliver and Jane, but also at the way people with medical difficulties were treated, often being used as medical guinea pigs.  It also touches on the growing pressure for political enfranchisement for all English citizens including women, the beginnings of influence by the growing numbers of England's ethnic and cultural minorities and very briefly. at the beginnings of understanding with regard to modern genetics.  Thus, ""The Heiress Effect"" borders on historical romance instead of just period romance.  All that said, it is at its heart, a sensitive, compelling, heart-tugging look at two people who are at once opposite and the same and who  are the embodiment of the aphorism  'the whole being greater that the sum of the parts.'  Well done, Ms. Milan, VERY well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20CH3PJG6SM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4ANSXE#wasThisHelpful","R20CH3PJG6SM7","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I make it to the 65% mark in a book I usually finish it.  The Ruby Brooch will be the exception.My very first time travel romance was Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I won't say that ruined me for all others but it did set a bit of a standard for setting up the time travel premise and having the time traveler cope with and adapt to the time to which he or she has traveled.  DG does it quite well by having her heroine Claire Randall flung backward to the mid-18th century and having to rely on her wits and common sense to navigate and make a life in the alien and often hostile environment of the Scottish Highlands at a time of great upheaval.  DG does a creditable job of taking a fantastic premise and making it believable and absorbing.Unfortunately, Ms. Logan and the Ruby Brooch cannot claim the same.  Instead of her wits, our heroine relies on the trappings of the 21st century: flashlights, multi clip repeating rifles and handguns, modern medicines including IVs and Tylenol, her iPhone, iPod and the straw that broke this readers back: a modern pregnancy test.  Her efforts to hide her ""other worldliness"" was perfunctory at best.As far a characterization is concerned, I found it to be uneven and often contradictory.  Both Kitherina and Cullen, our main protagonists cycle through emotions with alarming unpredictability and often without real explanation or provocation.  Some of the secondary characterizations are quite good especially that of Sarah Barrett.  I really like her more than Kitherina.  As far as Cullen is concerned, he is supposed to be a Highlander (seems to be requisite in time travel novels), but speaks English with very little Scottish influence showing in his speech except when he is engaged sexually with Kitherina.  It was infrequent enough to feel affected rather than illustrative of his character.The great western migration was a fascinating period in American history but very little of the history of that time is incorporated into the story.  While DG may occasionally be criticized for her massive research and how it shows up in her book as very detailed description, Ms. Logan might be criticized for not enough.  This reader got only the barest sense of what life on the trail was like.  My knowledge of U.S. History reminds me that it was a grueling, monotonous, dangerous journey and not enough of that figures into the story.Bottom line:  Given the setting this could have been a terrifically engaging read but is instead, shallow and silly.  Give this one a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOGIO86V2KL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QMSONK#wasThisHelpful","RXOGIO86V2KL4","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a hard time getting into this book.  With so many characters and confusing relationships, authentic Georgian Era dialogue that challenged my patience and a female protagonist whose personality I found annoying, I almost gave up on it.  That said, I'm glad I stuck with it.  The pacing could have been a bit better in the beginning, but Noble Satyr ends up being mildly tension-filled and intriguing.  The love story had a real stop and start quality to it, but for the most part I saw the logic of Roxton's actions.  From a historical standpoint, It is an excellent look at the differences in French and English culture during the waning days of Louis XIV and George II.Bottom line: I wouldn't call it a fun read, but it is an interesting and well told tale that establishes a well written series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWBU8XPKGV2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q9TWOG#wasThisHelpful","R3GWBU8XPKGV2D","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this author wanted to write a grand love story where the flawed, damaged hero overcomes his past to woo and win the strong, independent female protagonist.  The HEA delivers that ending, but the journey to that point is painfully annoying.The hero (H) has serious mommy issues resulting in his frequently stated disrespect for women of his own exalted social class, seeing them as weak, scheming and vacuous.  At the same time, however, he REPEATEDLY tells our heroine (h) that he cannot marry her because she is not his social equal even though she is the opposite of what he disdains most about women of his class.  This, however, does not keep him from several attempts, with varying degrees of success to get her into his bed, suggesting more than once, that she become his mistress.  Bottom line, the guy is a right bastard through 80% of this book.What about our heroine?  Motherless from an early age, she is raised by her doting, country doctor father and a maiden aunt.  She has a consuming interest in veterinary medicine and wishes to become a country vet at a time when women were barred from universities, let alone all professions except the 'oldest' one.  My main problem with her is that she is a tease.  She allows our H have his way with her, often topping just short of intercourse then pulls back insisting that to go further  would ruin her reputation.  Having that happen once in a novel is one thing, but it happens repeatedly in this one to the point where she looks more like a sexual tease than the spunky heroine she's intended to be.Bottom line:  this book is one giant eye-roll after another and I didn't care for either of the main characters.  The writing was flat, the pacing was sluggish and the only thing that mitigated the eye-rolling was the Hero's twin sister calling him out on his weak BS.  She was the only believable and interesting character in the entire book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4AEYMHXWANZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAOO0CK#wasThisHelpful","RS4AEYMHXWANZ","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have it: a plot!I am 25% of the way into this book and nearly the entire focus has been the main character's attempt to get the hunky Scotsman into bed so that she can hand in her V card.  She's mid to late 20s, previously engaged, has been dumped, beaten up and nearly raped and all that seems to have had less impact than the fact that he doesn't want to have sex with her.  They've done everything up to the point of actual intercourse including things that would have popped her cherry, but not the actual deed.  It would be nice if the author had a better understanding of female anatomy.  That way she could have let her female protagonist off the metaphorical ""hook.""Bottom line:  It sucks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VP5F4GSZY7MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OY0JFI#wasThisHelpful","R3VP5F4GSZY7MO","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A deception such as the one portrayed in this book could only have happened in a time before instantaneous communication and rapid travel across great distances.

"The first two thirds of this book was some of the smartest, cleverly imagined and presented historical romance I've written in a good long while.  Why?  Because the central conflict was realistic and convincing.  So many books in this genre rely on hackneyed situations that push the H/h together.  Typically it goes like this: one or the other needs to marry in order to save the family estate.  Some 'dark secret' or scandal and a series of often trivial misunderstandings serve to create tension until the inevitable HEA.  The reason that Adriana and Tynan get together follows that formula, but that's where the similarities between this book and so many others in this genre part company.  The scandal surrounding Adriana is realistic to the period and has created real problems for her family.  Tynan's entry into her life is due to the machinations of her now deceased father but the reasons for it are not quite clear in the beginning.The character development is good, the romance develops slowly, the dialog is quite good and the little bit of history included in this book involves England's oppression of Ireland in the late 18th century.  Both the characters and their obstacles and complications felt believable.  That's the good news.What I've described above occupies the first 2/3 of the book.  Adriana has suffered social ostracism for her transgression committed when she was a young girl just entering society.  Five years later, Tynan marries her as a means of furthering his own political interests and in so doing helps her make her reentry into society.  Unfortunately, the author chose a plot element to illustrate Adriana's reemerging personal strength and self reliance that I thought was silly and melodramatic.  I just can't see it happening and because of that, my estimation took a nosedive from a 5 star read to a 3 star read.  Pity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3A5BFD8I20H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GNFG56#wasThisHelpful","R2S3A5BFD8I20H","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had to think about it a while before I wrote this review.  At it's core, Lucien's Fall is the typical 'troubled-man-saved-by-a-good-woman' scenario found in many romance novels, but it is saved from the standard cliches of this familiar plot by the depth of characterization, a truly engaging story line and a minimum of  annoying and credulity stretching misunderstandings and plot twists.The opening of the novel grabbed me right away and I loved  how music was used as a barometer of Lucien's inner struggles and a device to attract Madeline, the female protagonist.  He is a truly flawed anti-hero who is at once detestable, pitiable and tragic.  Most importantly, for me at least, is the fact that Madeline is not stupidly blinded by Lucien's physical beauty.  She is a strong, smart woman who is caught between her duty to marry as means of preserving her family home and her growing  attraction to a man who is at once frightening and exciting, but most importantly, free.  It is his seeming freedom from convention that attracts her the most, but that attraction is a point of real and believable conflict for her.An important secondary character, Madeline's mother Juliette, was not as well drawn in my opinion and I really didn't understand her.  She seemed unduly bitter and manipulative and I couldn't find sufficient reason in her backstory to warrant it.  She does love her daughter, but she is not above overlooking Madeline's interests and desires to pursue her own objectives.  As a result, much of the tension created by  Juliette's actions felt contrived, less believable and annoying.  Another character, Charles Devon, Madeline's suitor, handpicked by her mother was a bit too forgiving to be believable especially given all the waffling Madeline did with him over whether or not she could marry him. She perpetrated a fairly significant betrayal and he took it far too well in my opinion.  I would have liked a little more tension from him.In may ways this is an atypical period romance.  It lacks the interminable gushing and highly descriptive emoting over the physical appearance of the H/h, the ultimate physical union of Lucien and Madeline is well written and not rushed, and it avoids most of the often annoying and illogical actions that mar many of the books in this genre.  Lucien is often detestable and Madeline's struggles to avoid being attracted to him felt very realistic. It did drag a bit in the middle, but the expected HEA was satisfying, believable and really, really romantic.Bottom line:  It is a good read and I recommend it.  I'll be reading more of this author's work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KBFFBFPVZR77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SY9JX8#wasThisHelpful","R2KBFFBFPVZR77","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I knew what I was getting into when I purchased this book: it's chick-lit, pure and simple.  Chick lit can be entertaining by allowing the reader immerse him or herself into high romance, usually spiced with a little sex before the inevitable HEA. I often think of chick lit as adult fairy tales: fairly unrealistic but fun to read.  With regard to most of these basic expectations of the chick lit formula, Ms. Bennett succeeds.  Her characters are those that you expect to find in most romance novels: a flawed and emotionally stunted, but devastatingly handsome male protagonist coupled with a 'strong,' nurturing, emotionally mature female protagonist who will ultimately 'save' him.  Clearly Sutton, the female protagonist, likes projects because Alex certainly promises to be one.So what problems did I have with this book that rated a two star assessment?  Several.  I've listed them in ASCENDING order of annoyance/disappointment: 1) The male characters most often acted like 12 year olds or at least they talked like it.  I do understand that men talk differently with each other than they do with women (usually) or in mixed company, but there was a level of juvenile immaturity that I had a hard time with. 2) The author chose to alternate points of view from chapter to chapter.  Chapter 1 is Alex's POV, Chapter 2 is Sutton's POV and so forth.  To me this smacks of amateur, fan fiction style writing when the author is not sufficiently skilled to create a distinctive voice for each of the major characters.  There were times that the alternating POVs were nothing but a rehash of a particular event in the story.  3) Once the seal was broken so to speak, the book morphed from chick lit to 'dick lit' with one sex scene after another to the point that it felt like filler rather than a device to move the story along or develop the characters.  Sex scenes dominated the last 60% of the book. 4) The author inflames one of my pet peeves in her choice to TELL you pretty much everything rather than SHOW you through dialog, action and setting.  The bulk of the story is told through internal dialog, again, in my mind, the hallmark of an inexperienced or lazy writer.  Some internal dialog is okay/necessary but the predominance in this book is grating.  5) My chief complaint is the plot.  It's about a half an inch deep and uses every--single--cliche known to literature before the couple's major stumbling blocks become magically and too easily resolved.  To wit: the clingy, bimbo ex-girlfriend heeds Alex's warning and goes away; the old boyfriend bows out without a whimper, both Alex's and Sutton's fathers enter rehab and they all join hands and sing Kumbaya as reconciliation and forgiveness rule the day.  Forgive my skepticism, but Alex's father's transgressions toward him are so egregious that I really had a hard time swallowing the big 'forgiveness scene. The H/h's culminating 'commitment scene' which is crucial to all HEAs in chick lit, is formulaic, overplayed and silly.Bottom line:  This can be read in an afternoon with absolutely no strain to your brain power, but when you finish it you may only get the same kinds of marginal satisfaction that you get from lite beer.  Personally, I prefer my romances to have a little more substance.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEW8PDKLG0VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTCH5RQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CEW8PDKLG0VI","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this at the 52% complete mark on my Kindle.  I'm slightly more than halfway through and NOTHING has happened in this story beyond the female protagonist, Jayne, mooning over how beautiful Luke/Lucifer is, eating dinner in H.E., LLc. corporate headquarters (Hell, get it?  Yuck, yuck, yuck), an aborted night out and taking a walk through San Francisco's Chinatown.  There is no action, there is no tension and as a consequence there is no continued interest on my part.There is, however, entirely too much silly, convoluted description of Hell's corporate structure, references to the poker games of the Archangels, the bowling league of the Guardian Angels, and the 'betting pools' of H.E., LLc.'s employees.

"What follows is a review of the iHomeSet Touchless Countertop Soap Dispenser - Automatic Sensor Pump - Stainless Steel - For Kitchen and Bathroom (8 oz, Silver) that was provided to me in exchange for an honest review.Packaging: The unit came packaged in a medium weight cardboard box with the unit wrapped in plastic to protect the stainless steel colored coating on the plastic unit.  Instructions and a footed unit base were also included.Assembly: The directions included a schematic drawing illustrating the various parts of the unit as well as instructions for battery insertion, filling the unit and attaching the plastic footed base.  Directions for assembly and operation were fairly simple but I had difficulty getting the 4th battery to fit flush with the other three.  As a result the plastic door to the battery housing could not be firmly closed as I would have liked.Construction:  While the main body of the unit may be stainless steel, but remainder of the unit is plastic with a stainless steel/chrome appearance.  The battery housing is on the bottom of the unit and wires that run the pump and the electric eye were visible within the battery housing.  Since the soap dispenser is used near water it worries me about water getting to the wires and affecting the operation of the unit.  Once it was filled with dish soap, I turned it upside down and noticed that the lid to the soap chamber leaks.  I had to wipe a considerable amount of soap off the top of the unit after righting it.As another consideration, while the stainless steel look is popular in kitchens these days it does have its drawbacks.  As with stainless steel refrigerators, ovens, microwaves, etc, the soap dispenser is prone to showing fingerprints and water marks, especially when sitting so near the kitchen sink.  What’s more, when I went to wipe the unit off, if I would forget to hold it from the back of the unit a dollop of soap would come out.  I am constantly wiping fingerprints and streaks off my stainless steel appliances and I found myself doing that with the soap dispenser and sometimes having to wipe up soap from the counter-top as well.  So my advice is to turn the unit off before cleaning.Unit operation:  Since this is a touchless unit, all it requires is a pass of the sponge or your hand under the nozzle to readily dispense a dime-sized dollop of soap.  The instructions say that a single push on the on/off button will change the amount of soap dispensed.Day-to-day use:• Day 1: I filled the soap chamber with Dawn liquid dish soap.  The unit operated as expected after I put in the batteries and held down the on/off button located on the top for 3 seconds as instructed.  A red light near the electric eye blinks to let you know that the unit is operating and it took three passes of my hand to prime the pump and get the first dollop soap. Several other passes under the spout resulted in soap being deposited on my sponge.• Day 2: I picked up the unit to wipe underneath it and the battery compartment door fell off.  The battery that I had difficulty fitting flush with the others was loose, but with a fair amount of effort I managed to get it back in and the battery door back on.  Unfortunately, at that point the unit no longer worked.  I tried turning it off and then back on which produced no results.  I also tried replacing all of the batteries which also produced no results, so the unit is now sitting, non-operational on my kitchen counter.• Day 3: The unit is now working. I did not do anything different to make the unit work, but it was working this morning when I tried it.  I was able to test the three different dispensing levels that were described in the directions and that feature does work.  The largest amount dispensed is slightly larger than a dime.• Day 4:  Still working, but the amount being dispensed is smaller than the setting I selected on the previous day.• Day 5: Still working, however it takes two passes under the electric eye to get enough soap on the sponge to wash a dish.  The first pass results in just a bare drop of soap, but the second pass is a normal amount based upon my dispenser selection.  I don’t know what is causing this except that it might be that the soap dries a bit in the nozzle if the unit isn't used for a while.BOTTOM LINE: This is a GOOD LOOKING product, but is a POOR FUNCTIONING product.  Given the problems noted above, I CANNOT RECOMMEND it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1KHQ2XXAGBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSQR1ZM#wasThisHelpful","R3P1KHQ2XXAGBE","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this book in exchange for an honest review.To be perfectly honest,  I thought I might not be able to finish this book.  First, the epub copy  I received was so poorly formatted that reading was often a frustrating physical labor.  I certainly hope that the published Kindle edition does not suffer from this problem.  Second, and more important is that the first part of the book is largely the female protagonist's internal dialog.  I understand that internal dialog is a legitimate literary device, but I find too much of it to be wearisome.  The internal dialog does lessen but there is still a good deal of it throughout the book.  All of that said, I am very, very glad that I persevered.Both Marin Strang and Lawrence Fyre are truly products of their upbringing.  Marin is the daughter of  strict Jehova's Witness parents but who never knew her mother because she died at Marin's birth.  She is so bereft that as a child she frequently picked out a woman that 'might' be her mother to watch from afar and devise stories justifying her mother's absence in the hopeful belief that she might not actually be dead.  As an adult, she ultimately rejects the strictures of the Jehovah's Witness faith and strikes out on her own leaving her often remote father behind.  Marin has become a school teacher,  is struggling to get past a failed relationship and lives very 'lightly,' in fear of accumulating too much 'stuff' that would keep her from being able to move on at a moment's notice.Lawrence is the product of an alcoholic mother and who, from a very early age, was the primary protector of his little sister. As an adult,  Lawrence is just endearingly odd.  He's an owner of a book shop in Brighton, lives in what amounts to a storage facility and has a eclectic selection of friends.  He is estranged from his father, his mother is dead and his sister, to whom he is very close, is perilously ill with a chronic, congenital condition.The magic happens when these two find one another.  There is a strong poignancy to their relationship that is often awkward, fraught with emotional undercurrents and burdened by the weight of their considerable 'baggage.'  Some of the most affecting reading I have done lately are the passages dealing with a substantial, heart rending loss experienced by Marin and Lawrence.  I cried through much of it but I have to feel it is a fairly realistic portrayal of the feelings of those who experience a loss of this kind.Bottom line:  This is a well written, and moving look at the journey of discovery of two people who didn't know they were lost until they found each other.  There are some rather cliched elements to this story, but even those are handled better than I've read in many books.  My initial concerns  were overcome by the depth of characterization, good pacing and emotive story development.  I'm glad I read it and believe Ms. Potts to be an author to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CS0J06ZO82V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHML3C6#wasThisHelpful","R1CS0J06ZO82V7","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel like such a curmudgeon as I write this, but I can't help how I feel.  Make no mistake.  I think Ms. Bernard is a talented writer who created a story in three parts unnecessarily, but that was original, interesting and reasonably well plotted.  My complaint lay in what I believe to be unnecessary serialization.The total length of the three books combined is 542 pages.  I figure that title pages, author's notes and previews for the next book down to around 500 pages.  That is a very decent length book.  So, why break it up into three books?  Of course my immediate supposition is to simply sell more books.  I understand that this my be Ms. Bernard's sole occupation, but I feel is a bush league, amateurish move that didn't enhance the story and certainly didn't sit well with me.As for the ending of the Black Rose Trilogy, I didn't feel that it lived up to the build up and, as a consequence, I'm left with a sense of having been let down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HHUVTB5SXIEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N20CIPA#wasThisHelpful","R2HHUVTB5SXIEJ","A2VDS6RU9H3BMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDS6RU9H3BMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start off with my short review. Watch it if you enjoy action movies where no brain strain is required, and you can watch at least one car chase and a whole lot of guns and blood.  It is pretty much along the lines of any of the Taken movies with less budget.Now that I have that out of the way I am going to address a few issues I see with other reviews.First of all, those of you complaining that B.Willis and J. Cusack only had bit parts in the movie seem to have forgotten that J. Patric is a very good actor in his own right.  Of course the movie preview is going to hype up the biggest ""action"" action star that is in it. If you are watching a movie simply because you want to watch B. Willis do the same thing he does when HE is the main star then you have absolutely no right to complain that this movie has a plot that has been done so many times before.Secondly, B.Willis & J. Cusack have such short scenes that I think those of you complaining about ""bad acting"" are actually just peeved that you were mislead about the main character. Which I should point out if you take the time to read the cast or characters it is pretty obvious who is the main protagonist.Now 50 Cent CAN""T ACT and he has nearly half the amount of lines of the other two and I don't see anybody complaining about him or the actress who played the friend of the daughter. THAT is poor acting.The story was a rehash of many other similar movies, yes. What I liked about this one was that at least this guy knew he was a scumbag and held no illusions about redemption. In addition, they made no attempt to make the daughter out to be some angel in need of saving and in fact she was well on the way to killing herself.What I found to be a little stupid in the story was how the first few non-scumbag characters the father encountered had no interest in helping him find his daughter and acted put out that he was asking. Even the friend wasn't interested until later in the game when she refused to leave, which was implausible considering her initial behaviour.  Most people will offer help to find someone so I am always annoyed when movie plots make it seem otherwise.  The Prince is certainly not the only movie script to use that device to  show how badass the main character is.  It is pretty much required plot filler in action movies.Lastly, J. Cusacks hair. ouch. Who decided that was the look they needed for an aging rich criminal?","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQ252R2J1UU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXUX8Y0#wasThisHelpful","R3MQ252R2J1UU1","A18019VLDBK0RN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18019VLDBK0RN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure why everyone always wants to pan on Nicholas Cage and Hayden Christianson's acting, to be truthful they weren't given a lot to do in the movie past fighting. It was the camera angles and the constant switching views is what nearly gave me a headache but I suppose if you don't have a large budget for action sequences you can pretend things are happening by ""sorta"" showing the fighting.  The foggy opium points of view and flashbacks were overused.N. Cage was really only more of a supporting actor and both actors were drug abusers (opium, alcohol) hoping to dull their many sins so one can reasonably expect them to behave the way they portrayed their characters, with halting speech patterns and wooden emotions.  If anything, the actors who portrayed the sibling prince and princess were the weak links in the acting department.I rented it for 99 cents and had waited a very long time to do so because of the bad reviews.  Which brings me to my biggest complaint about my fellow Amazon (and Google Play) reviewers: If you are going to take the time to write a review then for gawd's sake EXPLAIN why you rated it that way in complete sentences and more than one or two words. Otherwise your review is a complete waste of time.  You want your 2 hours back for watching a bad movie?  I can bet that you've spent more than that doing even worse things and using a cliche to rate a movie wastes a few minutes of your oh-so-precious time too.

I have no idea how true that part was, nor do I know what sort of aftermath came from a review of those actions.

"Pleasantly surprised. Most Creative Haven books are repeats of patterns in what I call ""wall paper"" drawings, or worse..they are just reprinted drawings from the older Dover Press coloring books.  This  one has actual drawings like on the cover, and plenty of detail without getting crazy.  It does have some of the types of prints I just mentioned, but they are few interspaced between the greenhouse type scenes. It is printed on one side of the page, and the pages are perforated so you can take one out for fear of ripping or ruining the book.I have most  (if not all) of the garden themed adult coloring books, plus about 20-30 more books ranging from the old Dover Press coloring books to the newer books being printed nowadays for adult coloring. As a comparison:  Johanna Basford's books are filled with gorgeous art, but pages are porous and printed on two sides. I haven't started coloring them because of this.  Then there is another garden themed book called Enchanting English Garden, where the images are not as detailed and there is tremendous white space.

Markers especially will bleed through and I think some of your more ""liquid"" gel markers would as well.

"I like these types of books for adults vs the Intricate pattern or Tangled type books because the don't repeat a pattern ad nauseum. It is a lovely book, but not near as detailed as the Joanna Badsford books"" Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Coloring Book"" and ""Secret Garden"".  In fact, one of the pictures looks very similar to another I've seen in a Dover Press book of a watercan full of flowers. So if you have as many books as I have you can get an idea of the detail in this one. Lots of white space that I wouldn't use anything but pencil or crayon on.The paper in this book is thick and not as porous as the other two I mentioned, and that is a good thing if you want to work with gels. I did try a few markers on the back pages and got bleed through. This is fine as the images are printed on one side and blank on the other, but if you work the pages IN the book I recommend placing something behind the piece you are working on as there is no guarantee the marker will bleed all the way to the next page.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16FPKJEZRLT4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692346856#wasThisHelpful","R16FPKJEZRLT4V","A18019VLDBK0RN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18019VLDBK0RN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story, is more about Mary B Cuddy than the ""story"" of taking three women who for various reasons have lost their hold on their sanity.  She agrees to take the three women East, to their families and in exchange for saving T.Jones, coerces him into helping her.  She has prospered on her own, yet she is lonely.  Apparently she is considered plain and ""bossy"" by the men, and so has yet to find a husband at the age of 31 and along the way she loses her reason to live.  The three women have a little of their stories told, one lost all her children to diptheria, one is abused and raped by her husband, and the other kills her latest child in what appears to be a result of the failure and future starvation of the family. Their crops and stock have all died.But it is not about them, it is about Cuddy and how the unrelenting cruelty of the west eventually breaks her will to live. It is then that Jones' hardened uncaring attitude evolves a bit during the final trip even when the world he knows as cruel, continues to beat down on him.The story isn't slow, but it is paced. Don't expect a shooting up fighting type western. I didn't find it depressing, but it certainly isn't a film with a happy ending for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWZ5WM72QXKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PM6G5TW#wasThisHelpful","R1HWZ5WM72QXKC","A18019VLDBK0RN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18019VLDBK0RN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not a good book at all.  I haven't read any Jack Reacher novels in several years but I don't recall the paragraph-long descriptions of how and why he does some minor inconsequential task.  Good gawd, how are we expected to believe that someone like Jack Reacher who notices EVERYTHING down to the last minute boring detail wouldn't ask to see a photo of a woman he supposedly fathered a child with when he doesn't recall the name?  Or a photo of the child. Or upon being told he beat the crap out of someone years ago and that the file contains pictures of the injuries he doesn't ask to see THAT photo? Or his lawyer doesn't show it to him to help him recall?  What about being told he could be prosecuted for adultery, and no questions were asked about the husband of the woman he allegedly fathered a child with?  One would think that might help jog his memory.This book is going back to the library, I am at the part where they are on the plane headed to California and I can't take any more drivel and reactions of characters totally out of synch with the real world.The police are incompetent, the lawyers are all idiots, and we are subjected to unnecessary musings on three paragraph characters.

"A story of one man's ruthless actions to get what he wants and the consequences, including his eventual comeuppance.  He doesn't plan most of his worst acts, but he takes advantage when the opportunity arises.  The setting for the story is a future where water is in short supply and the independent farmers who can't get the water channeled to their farms. The scenery and life depicted is brutal and unforgiving. Babies are bought and sold because apparently fertility is low.The father in the story is an alcoholic on the wagon after he caused the accident that left his wife a paraplegic. She's able to stand and walk if hooked up to ""guide lines"" in the hospital, or care facility where she lives. He tries to be good and help others as a result, and this leads to his downfall.  The story eventually follows the son and his choice of actions for revenge.It is not a fast-paced movie and has somber, dirty scenery for an atmospheric touch.

"The designs lend themselves more to a subtle blending of colors over the entire object. The examples in the book show graduations of color used on each animal.

Not much face time as expected for the old crew, which was disappointing because Terry Crews is flat out fun to watch and Dolph makes an awesome grumpy big guy.  That's what I enjoyed about the first two movies, the larger than life actors I remember from my youth and the ""catch phrases"" that came with the action movies.They aren't suppose to be believable and the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek. Which is why the movies are fun.Best lines of the movie:Wesley Snipes' response to why he was locked up ""tax evasion"", said with an psychotic grin.Stallone's answer to Statham's query about ""what was that?"" during the first skirmish.

"I've used these kinds of traps before and couldn't find any kind of humane mouse trap where I live. Walmart used to carry these, but they don't have any kind of live traps for mice anymore. I also tried Tractor Supply and Rural King with no luck.I don't think I will ever have a need for four of these traps, because the mouse I wanted to catch was actually brought into the house by me to ""recuperate"" after I saved her from my cat outdoors.  This mouse thanked me by escaping into my craft room for the two weeks I went searching for a live trap.I used to use peanut butter on a cracker in them, but this time I had some spinach dip so I scooped a bit into the lid of a 2-liter bottle and scooted it to the back of the trap.  I set the trap where the mouse had been leaving poops and caught her almost immediately.Miss Mouse, whom I named ""Bambi"" during her time on the lam, was then deposited back outdoors out of sight of the cat.  The trap is mouse sized, don't use them if you have bigger rodents. I don't even think it is big enough to catch a run-a-way syrian hamster.

"Fun, lots of action, and an actual story.  First let me say that the reviewers that claimed this movie had no action or was boring are clearly children weaned on bloodbath video games and the attention spans of gnats.  It is a fun movie with plenty of action, absolutely no frontal nudity or sex scenes which is refreshing to be quite honest.  The blood and gore is minimized and Hercules' merry band of mercenaries are engaging and fun to watch.Hercules is still very strong, but mortal and the way the story illustrates that legends are born from stories exaggerated and spread.

"I don't think one of these reviewers watched the same movie as I did because the flashbacks were not confusing, the heat was mentioned every 15 minutes or so in the dialogue and there were clearly more than one leather bag during the robbery.The movie moved along at a  nice pace and had enough character development of the townspeople that you had some what of a connection to them. The underlying theme is about redemption and whether it is attainable for different characters.  It is also about a small dying town and the question of whether it is worth saving. There is a lot of killing but it is not really that gory. The acting was decent with exception of the woman playing the girlfriend.The bad guys were definitely bad, but quite stupid. They got caught because of this and then ten years later they go around brazenly gunning down anybody who gets in their way. The idea that these acts will most certainly get them caught again doesn't seem to enter their minds.In reference to another reviewer's comments, I didn't find the flashbacks confusing.

"I didn't find this movie to be anywhere close to as violent as most movies are nowadays, the violence when it was there was appropriate for the story line. The movie description says ""two outlaw bikers"" when in fact they meet during the beginning of the movie and become friends as the movie progresses. One is running from the law, the other is running from his life.  I like to think that the latter becomes a better person having made the trip with Jason Momoa's character and seeing the family and community he is a part of. It is a also a sad commentary on how the federal government still treats American Indians poorly.

"dang this stuff is amazing.

Cats throw up, they drop poo bombs, they spit up hairballs and they create havoc...sometimes smelly havoc. It is an enzyme based solution, 100% biodegradable and safe for my pets and myself. It does not just use some heavy fragrance based cleaning liquid that masks the stain with flowers and fruit. It actually cleans, from the top to the bottom.

I do not play any games, or make a lot of phone calls. This phone with its speed, its vivid display, and memory/4GLTE I can watch/hear what I want too in clear detail. Send and receive data easily and it all looks and feels like a more expensive phone.The phone itself is really freaking light, thin, and not like one of those giant phones where people cannot decide if you have a notebook or laptop in your hand. The images, interface screen, is ""crisp"" and clear. It is Eye Candy for sure.I am not tech savvy but I was able to figure this phone out, use my NET10 easily, download and upload to any place I wanted too. I love the pictures this takes too! So very pleased.

"I have worries, even as an adult. I love anything whimsy that can help me get through any issue I have. I saw this Worry Eater and I fell in love. It is not just a doll, its a ritual you can do to clear your mind. You can write down any worry you have and stick it in its little mouth and zip it up. Spiritually its not any different than writing a worry on a piece of paper and burning it, sending it down a river, or handing it to someone you trust to help. I think this doll would be great therapy for any child who might be going through problems; parents divorcing, change in schools or house, sibling issues, body issues, anything really. You could even tell your kids to write down their worries and put them in there, and then the Worry eater could give them to mom and dad and they you could see what is on their mind, and discuss if they want too. A mediator if you will.This Eater, who I have named ""Fingers"" cause of the bumps on his head....is so soft and huggable. Made REALLY well, high quality for sure.

This is the Caramel Macchiato flavor, made with real coffee (which might have sealed the deal for me to try it, I will not pass up coffee) I did not like it. It was really too sweet for me. It had a strong taste of coffee, but not good coffee. More like some nasty starbucks prefab you buy at the gas station. It was really hard to chew, those 5 grains make your teeth work and it had a hard time going down without some liquids, and then I was picking this bar out of my teeth for an hour.

We give this to them not as regular food, but as a treat at night. We go into the kitchen to get it and they freaking know, they know the sound of us opening the can, and scooping out onto individual plates. I hear plaintive meows, I feel bodies rubbing against my legs, the sounds get high pitched and pleading...its that good to them.They do not inhale it, but rather quickly chomp on it and lick it up in the most joyful of ways. I have to watch them, and make sure the quickest eaters do not finish their plates then got after the slower ones.The food itself is such great quality, I can tell that with my human senses. It looks fresh, it has a smell but its not offensive and nasty. the consistency is not that gummy cheapness that can come with the bargain cans.

The Lightweight litter is SUPER light, with a great handle on the side. That handle is a freaking lifesaver when I have to carry it AND when I pour it. Usually when I do pour the litter, there is a little cloud of dust, not with this stuff. That also helps when our three cats go crazy in the litterbox, this did not stick to them like a film.It clumped easily, and scooped easily and when I had to throw it out, again with the not heavy.

"When I first saw this item I thought ""the possibilities are endless"" I have always wanted to have a ""home theater"" like experience. I have always wanted to be able to host an outdoor screening of horror movies and foreign films. Heck, what is stopping me from watching adult movies on my ceiling now? nothing!The Epson Home Cinema is first of all, very lightweight and compact. I remember having to haul around bulky projectors for school projects back in the day.Out of the box, the set up seems to be easy, even comes with a CD to help you with set up. I am not daunted! (which is a surprise since I have such an issue with electronics) It does not come with a HDMI cable, but those are easy to obtain. For first use purposes I am connecting to our laptop. It has the capabilities to plug into other devices such as a camera, phone, etc. Don't worry , I will not be showing my vacation photos to anyone who is reading this who knows us.We do watch a lot of Hulu plus, and have access to HBO/Showtime online. This is what I suspect I will be projecting the most! Its really easy to just plug in and follow the steps, You just choose what you are connecting too, and go from there. Mine recognized it was on my laptop right off. I am thinking we will have to find a screen to project onto since the walls in our apartment are not smooth and you can see all the imperfections.Even just a sheet might do for now!  it can project to any size you would want, that will come in handy when outside. The picture itself is beautiful, looks a lot better than my ancient TV does! You can adjust for vertical and horizontal. The speaker does fine on its own if you are inside and not in a big big room, but I will have to figure out how to hook up speakers for a more surround sound experience.It does not get too hot either, and it will quickly power off so you can pack it up and be on your way or put it up after you are done with it. I suspect I will be learning a lot more about this creature as I go, but for now I am confident I can use it without stress, and that it is going to be so much fun to have an actual bigger screen to watch than my 13 year old TV does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZ35QFUXE5W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SQG7CHE#wasThisHelpful","R2OZ35QFUXE5W0","A21VGNU5959O85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21VGNU5959O85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:35 MinsThis is a pretty tunic top with bright vibrant colors. The blue really stands out.  I feel like I am at a fiesta somewhere when I wear it. It has flared out sleeves that have a bright green and pink border design. Also the top is very stretchy if you prefer an off the shoulder look. The material is light and on the thin side, but not overly thin. This is cool and comfortable. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can not be used as a dress unless you are very short. I am 5' 5"" and this hangs down to about the bottom of my panties line. It is nice as a shirt though.

" 2:06 MinsThe Back to Bali Tunic Top is a nice light weight material that keeps me cool. It is on the the thin side. The top is built well as far as the overall material and make. Seems pretty sturdy and long lasting. I did think that the neck hole should be a bit larger. If you have a smaller build this may be perfect for you. But for a larger build like myself, the neck was a bit tight. Also the tunic was a bit short too. It is fine as a shirt. But it really doesn't flow down enough to use as a beach cover up for me. Maybe if you are extra short it might. I am 5' 5"" and I don't think it hangs down quite long enough.

"Super thin.....you can see right through these sheets. At this price I had a feeling they may be a bit thinner, but not as much as they are. I wanted to get these for my daughter's bed because she has a tendency to be a little rough on things, so I didn't want to spend a lot. Also I got the twin xl because her mattress is a thicker twin.

"Overall I am pretty happy with this supplement. I really was skeptical as to whether this would work to help boost my metabolism and energy level.  After taking it for over a week, I have to say that I have felt less sluggish and more energetic. The amino acids must be working. I also noticed that along with trying to cut back on food and starting an exercise routine, this supplement  has helped aid in weight loss. I do feel like my metabolism is a little bit better. The pills themselves are a bit large and don't taste too great. I try to swallow them quickly to avoid tasting anything. If you have difficulties with larger pills, this may be too large for you.

" 0:51 Mins This is a really cool, very pretty back pack that is well built and high quality. It is very sturdy and has heavy duty zippers. It also has straps on the back of it that can be used to carry it on the shoulders. It also has a nice strong handle along the top as well. I love the design, I love the color, and I love how well it's made. The only drawback about this is it is a bit small. There are a few compartments and then the main compartment which is a bit narrow. You could hold a few small books or use it as an overnight/travel bag and it would suffice. But this is not made for larger school books. They simply would not fit in this one. Overall, I really do like it quite well. If they made a larger version it would be absolutely perfect.

They fit around the ear perfectly and don't put too much pressure against them. Also the head band part is adjustable which also adds to the comfort level. My husband has sort of a big head and these work very well for him. The sound quality is very excellent. Crystal clear, amazing sound with no hesitation or interference. Outside noises are totally blocked out. I also have used these at night when he goes to bed and I want to watch shows online. The are perfect. We absolutely love them. Great high quality sounds. Top notch product. I definitely recommend them. Also has a built-in mic that works well too.I received these to try at a discount in exchange for an honest product review.

"Not too impressed with this product. The silicone collapsible diffuser was in my opinion very difficult to put on the hair dryer. It kept collapsing and shifting making it tough. And my hair dryer is an xtava and is not the model they list as it not fitting. So I had thought this would go on much easier, but it doesn't. I did finally get it on and was impressed with how well it did for my hair as far as defrizzing and smoothing. It does work. But I am not going to want to use it unless I permanently leave it on the hair dryer because of the difficulty taking it on and off. I generously gave it 3 stars because it does do what it says it does for your hair but I do not recommend taking a chance that it will fit your hair dryer. Not happy with it. I would not personally recommend it.I received this to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review.

" 2:28 MinsThis is the best diffuser ever. I am so super impressed with this that I have been telling everyone about it. I have tried a couple other essential oil diffusers, but this one is the best. So easy to use. The body comes off for simple and quick filling. I add a little water and a few drops of oil and it's ready to go. This fills my whole house with wonderful aromas. The best part is how cool this looks. It changes colors and is beautiful to watch. It is perfect for my home, a nice piece to show off to friends and family.

"I have never really tried any type of mask quite like this before. It has an intense warming sensation after it is mixed and applied to my face. It is suppose to be similar to a spa intensive treatment. The scent is very vibrant and awakening. As soon as you open the product the aroma is amplified. It comes with a small mixing stick because the product does separate a bit which is completely normal. I put on a generous amount and let it sit on my face a few minutes. Then I rinsed well and could still feel my face tingling for a minute afterwards. It really did deep clean and remove the impurities from my skin. This is great for an intense cleansing that removes dead skin cells and cleans out pores. It is fast and easy.

"I have been using this face wash for several days now and I really like the quality and deep cleansing. It has a nice liquid soap feel when you pump it into your hands. The pump works very well and the texture of the product is very smooth. It is just the right amount of thickness, not overly thick though. I add a bit of water to the soap while in the shower and it lathers up pretty well on my face. I can feel it cleaning my skin well. After using I pat try and apply a light moisturizer.

"This smells amazing. The fact that it is undiluted, pure lavender makes it perfect to use in my oil diffuser. This releases a beautiful, very pleasant aroma all through my house. I love the clean fresh scent and that it smells like actual lavender. I tried a couple others ones that just didn't smell right. The scent was off and seemed like it must of had additives in it. This one does not. It is very nice, very sweet and bold. And it smells authentic and wholesome. I also love that even though it's not a huge bottle, this little bottle is very long lasting.

"I was quite excited to get to try these Whey protein weight loss shakes. Everfit Protein Weight Loss Shakes are loaded with protein and they taste good. I also love the other health benefits to these shakes. They give me energy and curb my appetite. I received a case of 15 dark chocolate shakes to try. When they arrived I noticed that they are bottles with powder mix in the bottom of each one. You must add your own room temperature water, shake well, and then you are all set to drink it. Add 6 oz. water and it allows a little room for shaking it in the bottle.These have a nice smell, the aroma is quite pleasant. I anticipated that these would taste good based on the scent. I tried one out and I thought it tasted nice. Very pleasant chocolate taste. The dark chocolate is not overly dark tasting. Just slightly stronger than what a milk chocolate shake would taste like. The texture is just about right. Overall, I am impressed with the product and feel they are pretty great. The only negative thing I would say is that you must shake them extra well in order to totally break down the powder. Otherwise you will get bits of unmixed shake in your drink. I tried mixing it in the bottle vs. mixing it in a shaker bottle with a metal ball and they came out much better mixing them in a shaker bottle. The powder broke up much easier. A very good product. I do recommend them.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review.

"I love this eye product. Just a little dab applied to my under eye area and along the edges of my eyes where I have slight fine lines has helped my eye area look brighter and healthier. I am so impressed at how well this diminished the dark circles under my eyes which has always been a key issue for me. I have only been using this a few days so far but I am already very thrilled with the results. It takes the darkness and puffiness I experience almost everyday completely away. My eyes don't look worn down and tired anymore. They looked refreshed and lively. This goes on really well. It absorbs into my skin completely after just a short time.

"I received this a little over a week ago and my husband hooked it up for me in our backyard. We use this hose frequently to clean off the patio, fill the pool, and water the plants. It is essential that we have a high quality hose that is long lasting and is also compact and convenient to store. This hose is exactly what we were hoping for. I love how it shrinks when we are not using it, making it not take up an excessive amount of space. It is actually a pretty cool hose. Fun and easy to use. It does not tangle up at all either. And at 50 ft long it is certainly plenty long enough to reach all over our backyard.  We have used the hose a few times so far and it works great. No issues at all. I love the brass connector too. It is very heavy duty and built to last. Our last hose had a plastic one and it cracked and leaked in no time. I am really impressed with the strength of this one. Even the material of the hose itself seems pretty sturdy. I believe this will last for quite awhile. This also includes a nice multi-setting spray nozzle. The nozzle works fantastically! We are loving this new hose and nozzle set. It is amazingly easy to set up and use and it works just as I would want it to work. No leaks, no kinks, no problems.

"I received these to try out and they are pretty nice pillows. If you like pillows that are extra soft and fluffy, these are definitely nice. I got the 2 pack and stacked them together providing a medium amount of support. They are not overly thick or firm. These are the type of pillows that are good if you like to kind of shape and conform a pillow however you like it. For me, I enjoy a very soft, not overly firm pillow and so these worked for me. I do feel you need to use both pillows together to get enough support though, otherwise one is just not enough. That is way I gave it only 4 instead of 5 stars. They are comfortable and they have a nice soft feel and texture. But if you like pillows on the firmer side and that are more supportive, then these might not be for you.

"This antiseptic ointment works. My husband is diabetic and he gets cuts and scrapes easily. We have been applying this ointment to the areas on his arms and legs where he gets cut and banged up.

I am happy that it protects against infection as well which is something I definitely want to avoid. The ointment is somewhat thick and has a gel like texture. It is a bit greasy because it is petroleum based. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the scent. It does smell like petroleum. No fragrances have been added to mask that scent. It is not a very strong smell, but I am not crazy about the scent. Otherwise, as far a s quality and how well this product works, it is amazing. Very good product.

I have tried it for the past 10 days and it had helped to make me feel a little less hungry and more satisfied when I eat. I feel like it has given my metabolism a little bit of a boost.

The sound quality is very good on the mic and as well as on the earbuds. I listen to shows and music with crystal clear, high quality, detailed sounds. There has been no static or interruptions. It completely blocks out background noises. I love that is comes in a nice little case that keeps my cord from getting tangled. Very impressed with this product and do recommend it.I received this to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review.

"I have been using this deodorant for several days now. I was somewhat interested in giving a natural deodorant a try since many others I have tried seem to cause skin irritation due to a lot of chemicals and bad ingredients. This goes one smooth and is easy to apply. This is a solid white stick type deodorant. It has not caused itching or irritation in any way. It does not leave any residue or white marks. It is completely fragrance-free. As far as protection against sweat and odors, this works pretty well. The only issue I have with it is that is suppose to last 24 hours. For me I found myself applying it daily. But I do that with all ""24 hour"" deodorants I have used. This one and others just never seem to hold up that long, especially in this FL heat and humidity. Overall a good product though.

"Pretty nice sterile individually wrapped swabs. They work well. I was using these on a wound my husband had and they were fairly good overall. I kind of wished the cotton was a bit thicker though. They really aren't that full on the tips. Also, they have long sticks attached and the sticks aren't very thick or firm.

"Pioneer hit a home run with this one!  I have had countless receivers over the last 15 years and this one ranks as one of the better ones I have used.  Bluetooth function works perfectly and connects instantly, displays the track being played on the display and is easy to pair with your device.  The mic is clear for the caller on the other end and picks up talking in a normal voice.  No yelling necessary like with other mics.  The sound quality of the unit is excellent and pumps out plenty of volume even though it is rated for only 14 watts.  Far superior sound compared to my stock head unit.  The tuning options are EXCELLENT for a low cost product.  Low pass sub crossover includes output (gain) and slope level adjustments at each cutoff frequency.  The high pass filter works great.  There are adjustments for sound leveling, bass boost, loudness, custom EQ settings, and even a sound-retrieval compressed file adjustment.

"This was a major let-down.  Despite having great experiences with Alpine in the past I'm not sure what they were thinking with this receiver.  The bluetooth functionality is terrible.  It's hard to pair, takes minutes to connect when getting in the car each time, and the display doesn't usually have the correct info on the screen for the track playing.  The unit has very few options in terms of EQ, crossovers, display, etc.  The device itself is not very visually appealing in terms of the overall design and display.  It looks cheap and awkward.  The sound is nothing great either and not really an improvement over stock.

"I like this razor a lot.  Finally I can trim my head and beard in the shower instead of making a huge mess in the sink and on the floor!  Great power and does not bog down in wet or dirty hair.  The battery also lasts for many haircuts and will operate plugged in while it is charging if it dies mid trim.  There are a couple of things I don't like about it though.  First the guards are very sharp and hurt my skin compared to other brands.  Second there are fewer teeth than other brands meaning that it leaves more stray hairs when buzzing my head.  I have to run it over many times to get them all.  My old cheapo conair clippers had many more teeth and did not leave so many strays.  The multiple runs required with painful guards make using this a rather unpleasant experience sometimes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRY67BTVFU7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UE7D4Q#wasThisHelpful","RYRY67BTVFU7Z","APFEQMTX550NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APFEQMTX550NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really want to give this drill 5 stars but I just can't.  I probably got a lemon but the gear selector switch gets stuck a lot of the time switching from speed 1 to speed 2.  It gets stuck in-between the gears which leads to an unsettling grinding sound.  If I just leave it in gear 1 it works fine though.

"Great flywheel, identical to stock dual mass flywheel.  Luk is one of, if not the only, OEM manufacter for the 350z flywheels.  If you like the stock flywheel you will not be disappointed with this.  I tried a lightweight single mass flywheel and while it did rev up a little faster it lost way too may RPMs while the clutch was depressed during shifting.  It is hard to shift fast enough with the 350z shifter to keep the RPMs up during shifting.

"Just installed it in my 2006 Nissan 350z and works great so far.  Engages right off the floor firmly with no slipping at all.  Perfect replacement OEM, in fact Valeo is one of the OEM suppliers.  This clutch is identical to the stock clutch and is not a ""stage"" racing clutch or anything.  Great price on a great clutch.  It's worth the extra money vs some of the other cheapo clutches out there.  Much nicer feel than the stage 1 exedy clutch I had before.  The exedy had a very abrupt engagement that made it very difficult to shift smoothly.  It also had an extremely stiff clutch pedal.

This, combined with the metal inner frame means no lateral flex at all. It is also razor sharp out of the box which is nice and it keeps it's edge for ages. The handle is quite large so if you have small hands it might feel too big. Large blade as well, about as big as you will find on any folder it's a full 4"".

People talking about metal shards are correct.  The manual even mentions it - if you go around more than once, it will create these metal shards that can drop into your food.  That's not something I want to be micro-managing!  The fact is that it's difficult to hear, as the manual says, or see when you've gone around more than once.  I followed the directions and that lid just didn't want to come off.  PLUS, I found I had to go around more than once because the dang thing was so hard to use and the lid didn't come off!

If you can get over the higher price tag, it's a wonderful investment.  The battery is still going strong and if I need to replace it, it's user-replaceable and somewhat affordable.  I leave this vacuum out all the time in a corner of my smaller kitchen.  The only thing it lacks is attachments so I kept my giant corded vacuum for that, once every few months.

The Canon SX260 and Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 both fit in this case as I just tried it, but not the Samsung.  I don't know why people were saying the WB800F fit this case in Amazon reviews, as I checked reviews with the model # specifically before purchasing.  Believe me, if you can cram your Samsung in, I'd be worried about the zipper scratching the camera's finish, it's that tight.  It's just a very, very small case compared to others.  Even excluding my camera, I think this case doesn't give you enough flex space for batteries/spare memory cards for the Canon SX260 or the Panasonic named above.  It's just too small!

"We are absolutely thrilled with this case!  We have a 10.1"" Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and it fits just wonderfully.  We love the apple green color that is a little darker in person than the lime shown.  It is SO EASY to spot across the room versus that generic-fitting, black case we had.  This case has the speaker and camera cutouts perfectly aligned!  It stands securely and even has a Velcro tab that you attach once you put the tablet in, to keep it secure.  We had never bought this brand before and I was worried for only $15 it would not be high quality enough; it sure was.  The green is very attractive!

"This fountain was much bigger than I expected.  It's the first time I didn't measure something online so that was my only mistake.Besides that, it was too loud and splashy.  It was not pretty (like the photos) in the least - the copper looking tubes that the water passes through had some kind of very ugly joint glue applied.  It stuck out like a sore thumb.  The basin has a raised section that appeared to be cracking.  It looked more like an outdoor fountain, personally.  When I saw the raised crack in the basin, I emptied it and flipped the entire thing over and saw a massive crack on the bottom of the unit - even though it was packaged pretty well.Even if it wasn't cracked, I still think it was too outdoorsy and the ugly glue joints are unacceptable to me for indoors.  In addition, I think that it was too loud of a noise and too splashy, even though I wanted noise.  I returned it and it was a major hassle at an already busy Christmas time.  It goes to prove sometimes online photos are very deceiving in quality.I'm posting a photo of the ugly glue joints and crack.  Buyer beware.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8IWFYDA4NJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BSDY0E#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8IWFYDA4NJ4","A3LE0UC4D5LWFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LE0UC4D5LWFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost didn't buy this sound machine because of the negative reviews.  But then I thought it looks good, fits my needs, and most people go online to complain when they write reviews, so it was worth a chance.  We are thrilled with it.  It's a nice size, a nice form factor and style, it produces very good, clear sound effects, and my favorite feature is by far the day and date on the unit!  There's nothing like know what day it is when you wake up bleary eyed!  It has a very good selection of clear sounds to choose from.  Previously we were using a fan for white noise, but in cold Chicago winters it was getting way too cold to do that; and it used a lot more electricity.  We laugh every time we hear the fog horn sound noise and wonder who would want that one, but I found the ocean waves and another water one the best for me.  I accidentally had it on the real radio static for a few days and it sounded like one of the sound effects, haha.  It's my favorite alarm clock that I've ever owned and the fact it's a sound machine + day/date just makes it perfect for me!

"My son was 5 when he got this, now he's almost 7 and he absolutely loves it still!  It's highly interesting and it's the most captivating LeapFrog electronic book he has.  It's more durable than most people were saying - maybe other kids are rougher.  It's dual sided and features an electronic game on the back.  I absolutely LOVE what this book has given us.  More than free time for Mom to get chores done around the house, it's given him wonderful knowledge of the solar system.  He'll come to me and excitedly say some amazing space fact regarding a moon I've never heard of, or tell me how many hours a day it is on this planet or moon.

"As someone who has fragrance and goodness-knows-what chemical allergies, I am so thankful I found this dish soap.  I am saved from allergic reactions and massive, painful headaches.  I use it in my entire home: at the kitchen pump for dishes and hand washing and in the bathroom soap pumps for hand washing.  I even squirt a few drops into the toilet and use it as a toilet bowl cleaner.  Regular toilet bowl cleaners with or without bleach are too rough on my lungs; and this cleans just as well so why not?  I use it with a sponge on my granite countertops and I use it on my bathroom vanity.  I also use it on my mop to wash my hardwood and tile floors.  I'm sure Murphy's would leave a better shine, but I can't tolerate the swoon-inducing headaches or allergic reaction I get with stinky Murphy's, so I use this and it makes the floors cleaner.  I honestly didn't know I used it for so much until I typed this whole paragraph.  It's truly amazing!For windows and other applications, I use 7th Gen. all purpose free & clear in a spray bottle!This is a great all around cleaner.

"Sitting on this cushion is really helping my pelvic floor disorder.  I have to keep the weight off my pelvic floor, and this really does the job.  It allows the weight to hit my sit bones versus the pelvic floor.  Normally I would not be able to sit very long, but this cushion allows me to.  It's especially helpful in the car with all the bumps and jolts.  FYI: It's best to put a small hair towel over it because if you're wearing shorts or a dress, your skin will stick and it's painful.  Plus, it leaves a funny design on your skin. :)  I have not re-inflated it yet, and it's been a month plus.  I also keep a towel over the cushion in the car so no one sees it, as much.  I find it's a great value and I just purchased another one.  Amazon's price is cheaper than in the store.  I can imagine it's good for hemorrhoids or post birth too.

This J Fit one is very high quality and is actually better quality and firmer density than what my PT had!  It feels even more stable and solid than hers!  Since I sit on it and I am not a super lightweight, I am glad to have something quality to do my exercises on.  There's no use buying a cheap one to have it break and have to rebuy (as I saw with other reviews on Amazon).I'm using this for female pelvic floor therapy but I am glad to know it can be used for other exercises including readjusting and helping your back and legs.

"I love this product & it cleans my new stainless steel appliances beautifully, but the fragrance is so strong and over the top I have to have my husband use it instead of me.  For my large fridge, dishwasher, oven, and microwave, I end up using 3-4 wipes depending on how dirty the surfaces are.  I have found I've had to ""coat"" the entire surface quickly and then go back and work it in to avoid having a dried out wipe too early/streaks.  The streaks (overabundance of cleaner) go away once you coat the whole surface and come back to polish it in.  For me with my fragrance issues, it's less irritating than an aerosol can getting airborne would be and I don't have the scratchiness of  the paper towel to irritate my stainless surfaces.  This is more of a cloth.I called the company and they state all their stainless products have a mild fragrance.  If you were living in my body right now, you'd agree it's more than mild.

So right now he's in first grade; when this school year ends, I will buy the 2nd grade workbook and the first grade book will be done before he enters 2nd grade.  There's always something for him to do even if homework is not assigned or during a long break from school.  For 302 pages of color activities, I think the price is an exceptional deal.

"Thank you, Almay.  Without this product, I would have to go deodorant less.  I tried everything including Sure ""unscented"" which has a masking fragrance that is far from unscented; I kept getting headaches.  I tried Toms of Maine unscented which smells like moldy towel before even applying and I swear, I felt drier and less smelly wearing no deodorant at all.  This Almay product is *actually* unscented, no masking fragrance, no joking around.  I have really bad fragrance allergies and I don't even have to read the label to know if it's truly unscented - I can tell by smelling it.  I opened ""Dry Idea"" unscented deodorant and got a whiff, instant mini headache.  I opened this Almay and had no reaction.  I looked at the back of Dry Idea and it still stated ""fragrance"" in the ingredients.Somehow Almay works to control the odor and wetness without a masking fragrance and I am thankful.

"We bought this vacuum 2 years ago when it was necessary to suck up an giant puddle of water when a basement leaked.  By giant I mean about 10' x 5' wide.  It worked beautifully!  What I love most about this unit is its quietness.  After having a very old Shop Vac, this one seems no worse than the noise you get from turning on a regular household vacuum - it's even quieter than that.  I used to have to schedule when I would vacuum the cars so as not to annoy neighbors, but with this unit I can vacuum anytime!  My car interiors look great once again!We've used it in the workshop and again late last year when another water problem reared its ugly head!  We were getting our hot water heater preventatively replaced and what happens?  After turning off the water to the house, why the relief valve just broke off spewing 50 gallons of water all over my basement (DURING A FULL KITCHEN REMODEL NO LESS!).  At least it was the unfinished basement side, but it still got some carpet tile wet and risked getting some new drywall wet.  I used this vac with the ""C"" shaped crevice tool and it made an airtight seal against the cement and sucked up everything!  What a great tool!Advice: Read the manual.  We usually do but were in a rush with all these water incidents.  Be sure to take off the filter when sucking water, it will ruin it.  I just bought a new filter off Amazon for $10-11.

It holds paper money well so that I can easily see how much I have, and I can pull the bills out without a struggle.  Sometimes that can be easier said than done, but that is not the case here.  At first the RFID blocking shield made the wallet a bit awkward and stiff, but two weeks of use has broken it in nicely, and I couldn't really tell you that this was any different from a conventional wallet.  And, it looks great!  If you are in the market for a new wallet, this is definitely one to consider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFJVAWVEAFYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ17P84#wasThisHelpful","R3KFJVAWVEAFYX","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife enjoys reading mysteries, but hasn't had an opportunity to read anything by the Kellermans before, so I sent this book her way.  She hasn't read The Golem of Hollywood but says that reading the earlier book is not necessary to appreciate & enjoy this book.  She liked it enough that she is going to go back now and read the earlier book.Even though she doesn't know all of Lev's back story, the writing is such that it doesn't take long to develop sympathy for the character.  As the book progresses many of the characters become better & better developed by the narrative.  A number of loose ends from the first book will be tied up while the mystery of the 2nd book unfolds.My wife had no expectations of this book,  and although she comes across Kellerman in her job at the library, she was expecting to read a pretty basic whodunit.  ""This is the strangest book I have ever read,"" she says, which blurs genres and almost barges into the realm of fantasy.  But she really enjoyed it, and will be recommending it to patrons at the library when they are looking for an out-of-the-ordinary mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LIJGRMNKA4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171738#wasThisHelpful","R4LIJGRMNKA4D","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently started making the transition from Iams to The Nutro Company Grain Free Adult Cat Food with Duck and Potato Formula, 6.5-Pound, as a result of another free review sample, but I always like to try out the premium grain-free foods on our girls.  They certainly were interested in it, more so than any other dry foods we have tried on them.  It was the first time all three of them clustered around the food bowl filled with a new kind of food.  It looked promising.But the initial enthusiasm quickly dissipated, and they returned to the Nutro which seems now to reign supreme. If the Solid Gold only had to compete against the Iams, I think it would probably be no contest.  The list of ingredients looks good and is comparable to the Nutro.  While it sounds like I am damning with faint praise, I think that if you are trying to make the transition to a grain-free cat food, this will work quite nicely. But for our cats at least, it seems to have come up slightly short.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOZ3Z0SSHYPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTP9S#wasThisHelpful","RNOZ3Z0SSHYPW","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't generally have high expectations for headphones in this price range.  Generally, you get what you pay for.  And certainly these ear buds won't be taking the place of the more expensive ones I use on a regular basis.  But for 7 dollars, the quality here was quite surprising to me.  They leave a bit to be desired in the high & mid-range registers, but if you like lots of bass (I don't) then these ear buds deliver satisfactorily.  Interestingly, these fit better in my right ear than a lot of more expensive ear buds do, but in my left ear (rarely a problem) it is a less comfortable fit.  They also don't handle high volume music all that well, and if I were to push my luck in this regard, these ear buds would probably get fried sooner rather than later.  They appear to be well-constructed and sturdy, so I'm not too nervous about durability.  They come in a goofy square case which is more trouble than it is worth, and which I discarded immediately.  If you don't like your ear buds loose, keep this in mind.But in general, I am pretty impressed.

"John Sedgwick is straightforward in his preface to his Author's Notes section, stating that he is not writing a scholarly tome, but assumes that most of the readers of this book will be the general public.  Everything at this book reflects that, from chapters which are 3 pages in length to the complete lack of citations.  More than anything else though, is the strictly linear narrative which takes the reader over some very familiar ground in rather McCullough-esque fashion.Sedgwick is a very good writer, and I am rather tempted to seek out In My Blood: Six Generations of Madness and Desire in an American Family at some future point.  However, even casual students of history who have studied this time period really are not going to find anything new here.  It isn't a bad book, but it's just a story I have already heard far too many times already, with more thorough analysis.  I can imagine only novice readers finding this book to be informative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YUKB6HA3CLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408524#wasThisHelpful","R10YUKB6HA3CLZ","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a fascinating treatment, so far as it goes.  But Arendt is such a polarizing and complicated figure that I don't think it is possible to do a worthwhile analysis of her, and her body of work, even in a book which is supposed to serve as something of an introductory biography.  While there are interesting moments, the narrative moves at such a rapid pace that any chance at an in-depth examination is immediately lost.  This is book which is unlikely to change the minds of anyone reading it, and it certainly won't be of much help to those who haven't formed an opinion on Arendt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VSNAGDCB2TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054445619X#wasThisHelpful","R36VSNAGDCB2TB","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, the short story in literature is the equivalent of the string quartet in classical music.  Those who write them must have mastered their craft, or they risk having their weaknesses exposed.  Little wonder then that most of the great authors of the last century tried their hands at this genre.  And just as I loved playing string quartets (since they also leave the musician as exposed as the composer), so too am I drawn to the short story over any other genre in fiction.And there isn't a dud in the bunch.  This is a spectacular collection, both satisfying and provocative.  It is helpfully arranged by decade, but I found it more fun to skip back and forth between the more recent stories and those which are almost 100 years old now, as it is fascinating to juxtapose the different styles.There are some complaints that the older stories are given short shrift in this collection, but I feel that the emphasis on stories from 1980 onwards is what makes this anthology most worthwhile.  Everyone already knows that Hemingway & O'Connor were great short story writers, and there are collections aplenty available.  Fewer readers are likely to be familiar with Lahiri or Englander, and will now have the exposure & opportunity to seek out these contemporary authors.  Having said all that, this has also left me with the desire to re-read some older short story collections that have been gathering dust on my bookshelves for awhile.This is a hugely rewarding anthology and a wonderful overview of 100 years of ""The Best American Short Stories."" I just wish I could figure out a way to be alive in 2115, so that I could read the next retrospective anthology!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IG43XFX2EGUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547485859#wasThisHelpful","R3IG43XFX2EGUV","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first experience with rotary razors goes back about 30 years, and I wasn't especially impressed with them.  Blades were good enough for me.  However, 30 years have seen a lot of refinement in the basic technology, and it shows in this razor.  It is very comfortable to use & adapts easily to the contours of my face.  It is easy to clean.  It has a good display which shows when it needs to be cleaned or recharged.  It can be charged either through a direct connection or through the docking base.  I have tried both shaving dry & shaving wet, and both ways result in a close shave with minimal irritation.I haven't tried the beard trimmer.  I probably won't try it, since it involves removing the shaving heads and attaching the trimmer.  This is more trouble than it is worth.  Also the trimmer has only 5 settings with no actual measurements on them, which to me seems to be quite the crap shoot.  I already have a good beard trimmer with 19 settings; anyone with a fair amount of facial hair will not be looking to the Norelco for his trimming needs, as there are much better choices out there.The docking bay is ridiculously over-engineered.  It is enormous for what it actually does, and takes up some pretty valuable counter space in the bathroom.  It also will spill liquid if it gets bumped, even a little bit.  It is a nuisance.  I can't help but wonder how much this adds to the overall price of the product, and how many customers might be deterred from paying extra money for a docking base which ultimately will be discarded because it just isn't all that necessary.  I am using it at the moment, but I imagine that it won't be long before it gets tossed aside.  Hopefully, customers have the option of buying the docking base as an accessory only.But the razor itself delivers a good, comfortable shave.

"After a major rules correction from the 1st edition, Kosmos has released a new puzzle game in the American market which might appeal to people who enjoy playing Kosmos - Ubongo and other games requiring spatial reasoning.  One of the especially appealing aspects of this game is that you can scale the difficulty to your liking, placing down additional task cards if you find that a mere six cards is insufficiently challenging.  The only reason I take a star off is that, oftentimes, the task cards are inherently contradictory.  In the rule book, the designer suggest a house rule to get past this problem, but when a house rule has to be put in place to make for a fair game, it tends to annoy me.  However, it remains a game with a lot of challenges and considerable replay value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M4EIKJLNEOMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY3U8#wasThisHelpful","R3M4EIKJLNEOMW","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another one of the Kosmos 2-player line (originally published in the late 1990's) which has seen a recent US reprint.  It has been around for a good long time, and players of board games are likely to love it or hate it, based on a couple of factors which are huge parts of the game.The card draw is totally random, and there isn't much you can do to mitigate this other than count cards.  Not everybody is a good card-counter however, and this can also slow the game to a crawl if someone is trying to do calculations.  As often as not, the final 2 rounds will devolve into a contest of wills, as the players draw one card after another, waiting to unleash a well-timed attack.  Because you can play as many cards as you choose, and because one removed bridge can trigger a domino effect, it is possible for one turn to lay waste to the board and give a player total dominance which will be unchallengeable.If you don't mind the huge, swinging changes in momentum and control, then this can be a pretty fun & decent game, albeit a pretty cutthroat slugfest.  However, it really isn't for everybody.  There is skill involved --- quite a bit actually, because you have to set up the bridges correctly in order to have any chance of achieving the domino effect against your opponent --- but you are still at the mercy of the random draw of the cards, especially in the 3rd round.  A player with a commanding position can simply grab the cards which are most dangerous to him and subsequently discard them (this is where card counting can be useful) while the other player can do nothing to prevent it.  This is a game which my wife and I will occasionally play, but it won't take the place of the many other excellent 2-player games which we already own.This definitely falls into the category of ""your mileage may vary.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C05TJQM4H2BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","R2C05TJQM4H2BL","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the same problems that some of the other reviewers have experienced.  Our 3 cats are not stupid; they camp out in front of a single opening and wait for the feather to emerge.  Once it comes out, they grab on with claws or teeth and don't let go until I force them to release.  You can hear the wimpy motor inside struggling to function under the best of circumstances.  It has no chance against an adult cat with decent hunting skills.The ""mouse"" sound quit literally in the first minute of operation, and has never come back.  Each time we turn it on, the motor sounds weaker & weaker.  For a toy which has a $40 price tag, the engineering here simply is not up to snuff.  It is a great idea, but poorly executed.  It is probably a toy best left to kittens, who haven't yet acquired the hunting skills which will ultimately destroy this toy.

"The best thing I can say about this slow cooker is that it is made by Black & Decker and will probably never wear out.  The other positive is that a 4-quart slow cooker probably will work well for people in smaller households who aren't needing to cook quite as much food.But that's about it.  Even compared to the other 4-quart slow cooker I have, it comes up short.  The traditional crock pot design (even the 4 quart models) have tended to be short and more broad at the base, so that the heating element covers are greater area.  This thing is taller and more narrow; the heating is more uneven, and you're liable to see more scorching at the bottom.On top of that, the dial for the heat settings is a little clunky and has no timed settings.  The metal walls for the cooker are very thin, and as a result, the whole thing can get VERY hot.  Since there is no indicator that the thing is even on, this can be more than a little hazardous.  The lid has no vents in it; it also has no latches to lock the lid in place.""But this is a no-frills slow cooker, you dope!  You can't expect all of the amenities for this price!""  This would be a decent argument, were this a $20 item, but it costs $30.  A cursory glance of slow cookers available on Amazon shows a decent number with the same features (albeit with slightly smaller capacities) for under $20, and several with all the bells & whistles (such as the Hamilton Beach 33969A Set 'n Forget Programmable Slow Cooker, 6-Quart ) which sell for less than $20 more than the Black & Decker.  It is a crowded field, and programmable slow cookers are pretty commonplace now.  It hard to see the advantages that this model brings to the table.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128M0UM98Q1NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5XJ9BK#wasThisHelpful","R128M0UM98Q1NY","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Remini's work, even though I am no fan of Andrew Jackson.  His full-length biographies, for me at least, set the standard by which other biographies should be measured.  Even his shorter works are entertaining to read and are always informative.  So this book, Remini's final offering, comes as something of a disappointment.The narrative is much more straightforward and lacks the polish of earlier works, and the actual subject treatment is rather cursory.  A very complex subject is dealt with in less than 150 pages, and anyone with more than a passing knowledge of the antebellum era will be left none the wiser.

"It is difficult to write a biography when its subject has left almost no trace of his personal life.  This is the challenge Shane White faces with Jeremiah Hamilton.  There are no photos, no diaries, and no letters as far as White can discern.  The sources which are available are found in the court archives & in the contemporary newspapers.  The sources paint an interesting picture, but a rather incomplete one.  As a result, what emerges is more of a social history than a biography.Hamilton was clearly a controversial figure, but only in the short term.  White's biography focuses mostly on the years 1830-1845, because that is when Hamilton was engaging in his most dubious business practices (his career having started with a counterfeiting operation and apparently continuing on to wide-ranging insurance fraud), and as a result, was making enemies and finding himself in court quite frequently.  Once Hamilton had gotten his financial affairs in order, post-bankruptcy, he seems to have followed a less controversial path & was a broker respected for his financial acumen.  He wasn't being excoriated in the press, and he wasn't being sued, so there isn't much for White to write about (aside from the Draft Riots).  The last 30 years of Hamilton's life are covered in a relatively small portion of the book.But despite the paucity of personal details about Hamilton, this is a book worth reading.  At times it is more a history of race relations in New York, and a  history of the press in New York, than it is an actual biography.  For me, this wasn't a problem (I found myself looking the source material regarding the flash press as a result of this book), but for readers who are really looking for a straight-forward biography of a black millionaire, be advised that Hamilton oftentimes is nothing more than a supporting character in a book which is supposed to be his own story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32S29NEPWP2TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070562#wasThisHelpful","R32S29NEPWP2TB","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As soon as I had it put together, our girls (3 sisters) were immediately inspecting it.

My only worry would be over-eating; with three cats it becomes hard simply to put out a finite amount of food, because someone is bound to come up short after a point.  It is too early to see if the cats are gorging themselves or eating only what they need, like they do with the Iams.

"It becomes immediately apparent, from the very first page of the preface, that the target audience of the English edition is British, not American.  More precisely, the book targets Euroskeptics within the UK.  The earlier edition was very much aimed at a German audience and synthesizes a discussion of the recent turmoil with abstract musings about Buber, Heine, and other German philosophers of yore.What does this mean for an American audience?  A subject which, combined with Habermas' rather dense prose, which borders on the impenetrable.  Habermas presupposes the readers' knowledge of the events & controversies of recent years, and makes only passing reference to issues such as speculation against the Euro and Germany's exploitation of interest rates which favor German exports at the expense of debtor nations.  Don't know what any of this means?  This book will make you none the wiser.A thorough understanding of German schools of philosophy and political thought is helpful if you hope to negotiate Part III of the book.  Most my knowledge of Heine comes from Schubert lieder & Schumann's Dichterliebe, so I found myself floundering early and often.  In any case, it is hard to understand the complex nature of the German cultural legacy if one was not raised within it, so I imagine that even British readers will be struggling with this section.The 3-star rating reflects this book's usefulness as it pertains to the American audience.  Readers in the UK and Germany probably have a much different viewpoint.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OR9QST4S4VLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745686826#wasThisHelpful","R3OR9QST4S4VLJ","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Calling this a waffle weave is REALLY stretching it.  It is a not totally flat surface which gives the impression of a waffle weave, but that's about it.  It doesn't look terrible, but I would really hesitate to describe this as having a ""luxury"" appearance.  As another reviewer described it, it is ""stark white,"" and there really is no better way to put it.  That color really isn't for everybody.It also is advertised as a ""shower liner/curtain,"" but as has been pointed out by others, it is not in any way water resistant.  Using this as a liner would be a mistake in my opinion.If a really really white, waffle-esque shower curtain is what appeals to you, then by all means, consider this one.

"The double prong is probably the best feature about these skewers, as the 2nd prong helps keep both veggies and meat just a little bit more stable.  Not being able to put these over direct heat isn't a big deal, as long as you know how to cook properly with indirect heat.  People accustomed to slapping something on a grill over direct heat will need to adjust.  Getting the food off the skewers is very much a two-handed affair, with both hands needing protection against the heat, so be advised.

"I have been using Aurvana earphones for a number of years now.  The Creative Aurvana 2 In-Ear Headphones (Discontinued by Manufacturer) which I received for reviewing worked wonderfully until a co-worker knocked them off my desk and then stepped on them.  I liked them enough to purchase another set.  If this set wears out, I will probably replace it with Creative Aurvana In-Ear2 Plus Ultra-comfortable Noise-isolating In-ear Earphones with In-line Remote and Microphone, although I hope to keep my current set alive for many years to come.So I do like Aurvana products.  Or at least some of them.  When the Creative Aurvana 3 In-Ear Noise-Isolating Headphones became available, I tried those and really didn't care for them at all.  They are uncomfortable, difficult to place in your ears, and don't have the greatest fidelity.  This 3-Plus model is the updated version which has new features the compliment smart phones and other newer devices.So they are new.  Are they improved?  They are slightly more comfortable than the earlier model, but not by a lot.  Just like the earlier version, these earphones get crammed into your ears to the point that the seal they create can cause quite a bit of pressure to build up in your head.As far as fidelity is concerned, there is nothing about these headphones which represent any improvement over the previous model.  The same muted sound exists, same as before.  Another reviewer criticized these as being oriented towards the treble.  I could not disagree more.  I would be delighted if there was a bias towards the higher end of the register, but the truth is that both bass and treble get the same ""blah"" treatment.  Lovers of thumping bass will not be happy with these, but don't look at these as being treble-heavy by any means.Acoustic music is what I mostly listen to, and it is not well served by these headphones.  The sound is muffled and the purity of acoustic instruments is completely lost.  For me, this is a deal-breaker.  Amplified music fares perhaps a little better, but not much.On the positive side, the new cord is an improvement, and the volume adjustment feature (which now seems to be de rigueur on all new headphones) is quite nice.  And they do cancel out most of the background noise quite well.  If this set cost $80, and your main concern is noise cancellation, then it might be worth it.  But for the moment, they cost $150 and I cannot see anyone getting his money's worth at that price.  If you want Aurvana earphones, get the 2-plus model instead, which actually DOES cost around $80 and delivers better sound quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZ2XGV1RNYTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0WUGXO#wasThisHelpful","R2CZ2XGV1RNYTX","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew to expect a smaller machine, but I wasn't really prepared for just how tiny & light it proved to be.  There are small cats which are heavier than this thing, and I do not exaggerate.But as small as it is, this vacuum is a beast.  The suction is astonishing.  I tried this on one of our runners, which is relatively low pile,  and really had to muscle it along because it grabbed so firmly.  I expect that this vacuum would be utterly impossible on a high pile carpet, so keep this in mind.  I expect that we will be using this mostly on our wood floors.  It cleans wood surfaces very thoroughly.Assembly is a piece of cake.  Everything snaps together without any work, and the manual really isn't all that necessary.  It includes a docking station which you can attach to your wall if you like, but I chose to disassemble the machine partially and put the motor on a shelf while it recharges.  It is so small that it does not get in the way, even on a bookshelf.Because it is so small and has such tremendous suction, the canister fills up almost immediately.  This makes anything more than the smallest of jobs a challenge, especially considering that the battery will run down after about 15 minutes of use.  Recharging it will require about 2-3 hours.  So if you have a large area to clean, you may find that using this vacuum would be a rather frustrating experience.But I doubt that this vacuum is intended for 10,000 square mansion.  If you live in a small apartment, where storage space is at a premium, then this vacuum could be a dream come true.  In any other situation, I have a hard time imagining that this would serve as the main vacuum.  But what it does, it does very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208U4XNZ1NQ52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJQ72#wasThisHelpful","R208U4XNZ1NQ52","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Arthur Browne's writing style absolutely drives me crazy.  He shifts from the conventional past tense (when telling Battle's story as a policeman) into the present tense (and even the occasional future tense) as he tells the story of Battle and Langston Hughes.  He is inconsistent about it, and it is distracting to read.  There were points in the book where I had to resist the temptation to skip past the Hughes chapters because of the distracting writing style.I also feel that Browne is a little less objective about his subject than he should be.  Battle certainly was not corrupt, but he sometimes worked for superiors who were corrupt (or at least were brazenly pursuing political agenda), and he seemed not to be bothered by this.  While this is a minor issue overall, it certainly would have made for a more interesting & probing biography, in my opinion.  Browne seems content to present Battle as an uncomplicated hero, by and large, and leaves it at that.But nonetheless, it is a very interesting story which has been overlooked.  It captures, in microcosm,  the story of institutionalized racism in this country, and demonstrates just how many obstacles a talented, ambitious African-American might have to face in order to achieve even a modest degree of success.  I just find myself wishing that the writing could have been more well-crafted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9JSWL3ESGIDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807012602#wasThisHelpful","R9JSWL3ESGIDC","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an engaging & compelling narrative, which provides a fascinating peek into the world of the hotshot.  To a certain degree, it also illustrates how the Granite Mountain Hotshots evolved into the unit they were going into the Yarnell Hill fire.But even as a reader with absolutely no expertise or experience in these matters, I found that the story seemed incredibly incomplete, with significant gaps in the narrative.  Some of the other critical Amazon reviews are much more specific when dealing with inaccuracies in the book.  Some cursory research on my part quickly revealed that the investigation into the Yarnell Hill fire is still ongoing, and that the deposition of Brendan McDonough still has not taken place.  How in the world, with so much still remaining to be investigated, can anyone write a book claiming to be ""definitive?""I enjoy Dickman's writing, and I was moved by the stories being told, but this reminded me more of an expanded magazine article than a carefully-researched book.  The material draws overwhelmingly on interviews instead of any written documentation --- not surprising, considering that the documentation of this tragedy is very much a work in progress.

"Great stories don't necessarily have happy, tidy endings.  This is one of those, as Chatterton & Mattera now find themselves in a legal brawl over the rights to the wreck they discovered.  But the journey they took, which ultimately lead to the discovery of the Golden Fleece, is a compelling one.  These two treasure hunters have personal histories which could persuade me that they were created by a Hollywood scriptwriter, and contain so many defeats and reversals that I found myself shaking my head in amazement.  I certainly would have given up long before either of these guys did,The book also gives a good glimpse into just how tedious it is to do proper salvage work, and why sound research is the best way to yield good results.  While some hunches were played along the way, Chatterton & Mattera both repeatedly returned to the source material for clues as to what they had missed the first time around.Even knowing the outcome of the hunt doesn't detract from how interesting this story is.  Kurson knows how to weave the narratives of past & present together, and also presents some entertaining side stories of some of the treasure hunters of earlier generations.  This is good stuff.

"After a very disappointing experience with the poor engineering of the Sony MDR-NC60 headphones, I have pretty much had a ""once-bitten, twice shy"" attitude towards standard-sized noise-cancelling headphones.  When it comes to noise-cancelling headphones, I have used the in-the-ear variety rather than the traditional cans, so I was curious to see how these would perform.So far, so good.  I have noticed very little distortion in either ear, and the noise cancellation works pretty much as advertised.  I have found that the battery has held up well after almost 2 weeks of continuous use, so I am guessing that Bose's claims of a 35-hour lifetime is fairly accurate.  For spoken word, I generally don't use the noise cancellation as it isn't all that necessary, but for acoustic music, if you don't use the noise cancellation the sound is just awful, as though the musicians were playing in a closet.For me, the balance is good; no overpowering bass, & the treble is serviceable.  If you are wanting booming bass, then these aren't the headphones for you.  Also, if you are looking for headphones for a stereo, it is worth noting that these are designed for handheld devices and computers only, and will not work well with a stereo amplifier.I do have some reservations, and I can see why there are as many 1-star reviews as there are.  The folding design makes me nervous, and the carrying case is just ridiculously small.  If I folded them up the way it is recommended, it wouldn't surprise me if something malfunctioned before too long.  I am using a larger carrying case and treating them carefully.  This is definitely something to consider.Obviously, it is too early to give a fair assessment of how well these headphones will hold up after extended use.  Only time will tell, but for now, I am quite pleased with the performance, which seems commensurate with the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192UXGUUP0SBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VW7U8X4#wasThisHelpful","R192UXGUUP0SBS","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used the smaller At-a-Glance monthly planners for a couple of years now.  They are invaluable, but the space for writing things can be limited.

It helps that the spout is a one-touch, easy-to-use feature.  One press of a button, and the spout is immediately available for use.  Closing the spout is also just as simple.  My daughter's only complaint is that, should the water bottle be full, the spout can sometimes lightly splatter her with liquid when it pops open.So why only 4 stars?  In addition to the mild inconvenience of the splattering spout, the straw comes lose a little more easily than it should.  The straw is also attached by some plastic that looks a little too flimsy for my comfort, and I can see the straw tearing lose before long if we aren't careful.

"These cutters are certainly strong, formidable beasts.  It cut through most every thing I put in front of it.  Unfortunately, the breadth of the handles is such that even people with larger hands (such as myself) will find using these to be more of a chore than should be necessary.  People with smaller hands, or people with arthritis, will find these cutters to be hopelessly inaccessible.  Some reviewers have taken off a star for this; personally, I think this merits a harsher rating.  If you can't actually USE the cutters, it really doesn't matter how strong the blades are.  It feels like the design was intended for 2-handed shears, except that the handles are too short for them be used comfortably with two hands.While the cutters work well enough, the awkward nature of the handles means that I would not be using these on a regular basis.  Definitely, this is one of those items which you shouldn't purchase sight unseen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AENCEUGVNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDT5PL0#wasThisHelpful","R16AENCEUGVNA","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically, shock humor for its own sake.  It takes all of the forced ""humor"" of Apples to Apples and pastes on a gratuitously offensive & crass theme, the novelty of which will wear off very quickly (guaranteeing, of course, a seemingly endless number of expansions).If you asked a group of boys, aged probably 9-13, to design a game they thought was funny, the result would probably be very near to this.  Crude humor can be pretty funny & effective if the delivery is right.  The delivery in this game is so obvious, unsubtle & ham-fisted that what little humor there may be is instantly obliterated with a sledgehammer.And really, some topics are beyond the pale for a very good reason.  Let's just leave it at that.  There are plenty of better party games out there to be played.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X52XPCEPKDM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM#wasThisHelpful","R1X52XPCEPKDM9","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just be advised --- whatever this set may be it is NOT a pétanque set, nor is it even a proper bocce set.  Lacquered wooden balls are what you COULD use for bocce, but they are only 3 inches in diameter, and standard bocce balls are over 4 inches in diameter.But if these are not quite up to the standards for bocce, the balls are in no way whatsoever intended for pétanque and should not be used for it.  Proper pétanque boules are metal & hollow, as another reviewer has already pointed out.It mystifies me why this set would be marketed the way it is.  If you are looking for a decent starter set for pétanque, there are plenty of legitimate sets available.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVTBTKXEJ5MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z6SLD2#wasThisHelpful","RRVTBTKXEJ5MF","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the most part, this mix has worked fairly well.  It hasn't worked as well in some of the shady areas, but this isn't totally surprising.  I have tried it with both the Lawn Repair Soil that Scotts recommends & also with some manure spread out on the ground.  For the most part, the results have been pretty much the same.  For repair on small parts of a lawn, it has definitely worked better for me than simply putting down regular seed.  So if you just have small patches in need of some help, this is a good way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOS3455V0GA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTDGT3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1AOS3455V0GA9","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All three of our cats (three sisters) love these treats.  This is unusual for them, because usually there is at least one of them who ignores the treats that the others like.  The only problem they have, and this is relatively minor, is that the color of the treats is so dark that they sometimes can't spot the treats when I toss them on the floor, and they have to scout them out by scent.  Other than that, these treats have been a big hit, they are healthy, and they are not ruinously expensive.  After looking at the other reviews, I would have to say that our results have not been typical.  It is quite possible that our girls are just a bunch of weirdos --- your mileage may definitely vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCD1ES7ZJJ0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTV8NAA#wasThisHelpful","R1GCD1ES7ZJJ0P","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It almost doesn't look like a women's watch, but it looks lovely on the wrists of both my wife & daughter.  It is just a little bigger than what my wife is used to, but she says that it feels very comfortable & not especially heavy.  The band is especially well-designed and feels quite nice.

"This is a really attractive sofa which should fit nicely in most design schemes.  It is also VERY comfortable, with a leather-like fabric which feels very nice on the skin.  The weather is still cool enough that we noticed that the couch warmed to the touch; I will be interested to see how warm or cool the fabric is once the hot summer months come around.  But for now, we find comfort in this sofa, in every respect.The pillows come with the sofa, and are more of the flat, decorative variety (with a fair amount of embroidery).  If you are looking to take naps on the sofa, these pillows will work in a pinch but aren't ideal.  On the other hand, they aren't so bulky that they will get in the way of anybody.The short legs of the sofa arrive detached, and will need to be screwed in.  3 of the 4 legs were easily attached, but the 4th hole was not properly drilled & required a little extra work on our part.  The seat cushions detach, but the back cushions are attached to the main body of the sofa.  The sofa itself is light enough so that it is possible for a single man of average strength to maneuver it up front stairs, into the house, and into its desired location.  Obviously this isn't the optimal situation, but it can be done if there are no other alternatives.  In any case, getting it into a normal house is not going to be a massive problem for most people.  It is a sturdy couch; there was almost no packing material surrounding it in the cardboard box, but it arrived undamaged and in good condition.If you're looking for a couch, this is definitely one to consider.  It looks as good in person as on the internet, possibly better.  It enhances our living room wonderfully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Q0XIHOW36BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QM2KYU6#wasThisHelpful","R11Q0XIHOW36BM","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott's shade mixes have worked well for me in the past, better than some of the other shade mixes I have tried.  I have always been satisfied with their seed mixes in general.  This particular mix is going in one of the shadiest parts of our north-facing front yard (it gets the minimum amount of sunlight Scott's recommends for this mix, but not much more than that), so germination could be a challenge.  I will update as the season progresses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB98053Y3N4R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PCEMZQ#wasThisHelpful","RB98053Y3N4R8","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Echoing other reviewers here, I immediately could tell that these bags are not airtight, nor do they hold liquid all that well.  I would never want to use these for freezing food or marinating anything.  They'll work well for storing non-perishable items, I suppose, but that really isn't the reason that I purchase storage bags in the first place.  They claim to be stronger than Ziploc, but I am unpersuaded.  Yes, the zipper is more convenient to use than Ziploc's conventional seal, but from my perspective, sacrificing effectiveness for convenience is not a reasonable tradeoff.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JN96RNSQ58WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1JN96RNSQ58WM","A2FS38D943KX12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FS38D943KX12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every since I got this speaker, I instantly feel in love with it. The sound from the speaker is just amazing and it is perfect with the music that I listen to.The speaker is made really durable and feels great. I love the cylinder design of the speaker because I can have the speaker laying horizontally or I can have it standing vertically. Sound comes from one side of the speaker. The design of the speaker is really nice and it has IPX4 WaterProof, so that means it can handle splashes from any direction. In this case, the speaker can not be submerged under water.The controls of the speaker are really easy to use. The power button is on one side of the speaker and it is a huge button. The power button is also used for answer calls and hanging up calls. On the speaker you will find LED indicators that will tell you when the speaker is on and work. Next to the LED Lights you will find 3 buttons. You will find the Play/Pause button as well as the Volume buttons, you can press the +/- buttons to change the volume but if you want to change the track you will have to press and hold for a few seconds and your track will change.I love the grips on the speaker both horizontally and vertically. When I have this on my desk it will not move around at all. The rubber grips keep the speaker in place.The charging port of the speaker is covered on the side of the speaker. When you open the flap of the speaker, you will find the micro USB port as well as an AUX port so if you device does not have Bluetooth capabilities, you can simply just plug a AUX cable in and listen to music.Sound Quality from the speaker is amazing. With two powerful 6W speakers you get a total of 12W. The size of the speakers are 40mm. Sound coming from the speaker is nice and clear and crisp. Speaker has powerful bass and is perfect for all you needs. Treble from the speaker is nice and clear as well. With the speaker running via Bluetooth you can get about 10 meters away from the speaker which is about 33 feet. The speaker also has a built in microphone, I have tested it with a call and it is nice and clear and works like a charm with no problems.When you purchase the speaker, you have an option of either orange or blue, in my case I got the blue one and I love the color of the speaker. You will also get a micro USB cable and a AUX cable. A user manual is also included.If you are looking for a great speaker with amazing sound, this is the one to go for. It is powerful and durable. It is Splash Proof, not Water Proof. Speaker is great for outdoor activities like camping or fishing. Has a 18-month warranty, so if anything happens to the speaker you will be covered by the warranty. Highly recommend speaker for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120820FIQ3N0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZS5YT2C#wasThisHelpful","R120820FIQ3N0L","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I currently use this on my Nexus 6 and I have not had any problems at all yet. It is just simply amazing what it can do. It can also be used as a sync cable to transfer data.Nice and small and easy to carry around. Cable is nicely made and does not tangle up.Looking to watch movies but have no room on your phone? Just buy this and you will be able to watch movies from your flash drive or hard drive. Works on the Nexus 7 as well.

"I have been using many case for my phone since I got the phone and I have to say that this case makes my phone stand out to others because of the Flash ring that goes around the phone when  I get a notification.The case is made out of a plastic material and in the inside of the case you will find a rubber bumper that will go around the phone and then it will go into the plastic part of the case. It protects my phone from drops and scratches. The cut outs of the case are perfect. I have not had any problems with them yet. Installing the case and removing it can be a bit hard at first but I got use to it.The flash on the back of the phone will be covered up so the flash will flash throughout the phone. So if you are looking to take pictures with flash the flash will not be as bright. Great to use the flash in the dark because you will be able to see. Instead of beaming the flash in one direction, with this case you can almost fill up the room.Really nice case overall, I really like the flash ring on the case.

"Really nice Bamboo Cutting board to have in the kitchen. It comes in 3 different sizes so you can use each cutting board with different types of food.The cutting boards are made with Natural Bamboo. The surface of the cutting boards are nice and smooth and made really well. I really like that there are different sizes because I can use it with different types of food and don't want to cross contaminate the bacteria from the food on the cutting board to the other types of food. For examples, you can use the big cutting board for meats and the medium size one just for vegetables.All of the cutting board have a handle to to them so it is a lot easier to store them away when you are not using them. I can simply just hand them some where and when I need to use them, I can just grab them and start cutting. The cutting boards are nice and thick. They have a 3/8 inch thickness which is really nice and durable.The bamboo cutting board has ANTI-MICROBIALS - Microbes can't live in bamboo like they do in other wooden cutting board. It's physically impossible. Therefore, your surface is always free from dangerous things like e. coli or salmonella poisoning.Since I am cooking everyday, it is nice to have more than one cutting board to use with different types of food. They are nice and solid cutting boards so if you are looking for new cutting boards, I highly recommend this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYGOM8A0OJGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCAPEJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1TYGOM8A0OJGC","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cables are simply amazing. They hard made nice and durable and will last you a long time. I am currently using these cables and they have not ripped or anything else.

I have had cables that would easily get cut or ripped because of pulling on them, but these cables will last you a long time.The design of the cable looks really nice.

What I found out is that the micro USB on the cable fits in perfectly and has a nice and secure fit for my phone and tablet.With the braided nylon cable, the cable is tangle free.Overall, the cable is built nice and sturdy and it is very durable.

The case comes in many different color. The cut out of the phone are perfect and I can easily press them with no problems at all. The Sleep/Wake button on the side of the phone is covered while the Volume Buttons are open. The Sleep/Wake button is not hard to press. The Camera cut out is just the perfect size and I have not had any problems with it yet. Comparing the camera cut out to other battery cases that I have seen or used, this one is different because it is cut out more that usual. With the open space on the camera port, you will more likely damaged the phone itself if anything was to drop into there.  I really like the finish of the case. It is a matte finish so it is nice and smooth. I am able to slide my phone in my pocket and remove it from my pocket with no problems at all. Though that the case is black and has a matte finish to it, it does not gather any dust at all.On the back of the case you will find that there is a stand that is built into the case. The stand clips onto the case and when it needs to be used you can just pull it out and use it for movies. The stand is the perfect angle for watching movies. Also located on the back of the case is the Power button and 4 LED Light indicators which tell you how much power is left on the battery of the case. Each LED Light indicator represents 25%.Usually on battery cases they have a Micro USB Port so you can charge the battery in the case but on this power case it does not have one of those but instead it uses the lightning cable. So you think you are getting away from using your lightning cable? Nope, it is still on there. Also the Audio Port for the phone will be harder to access because of the case. You will only be able to use the headphones that came with the phone or other headphones have a small enough jack.The case does not come with anything else at all. All it comes with is just the cases and a little slip of paper giving you instructions on how to use the case. That is the reason why this review is only receiving 4 stars because of the lack of accessories. It would be nice if they included a cable and a audio jack extender cable so you can use any kind of headphones with no problems at all.Overall, this power case is nice and slim and add life to your phone. With the 3500mah battery in the case you will be able to double your battery life. If you are looking for a battery case for your phone. I would recommend this one to anyone who is looking for one.

"This is perfect for the night time or any time during the day when you want to go to sleep and want it to be dark. I currently use this during the night because in my room there is always little light that would bother me when I am sleeping. My alarm clock gives off a light that bothers me when I sleep but now with this Eye Mask I am able to sleep peacefully.The Eye Mask is nice and soft and it is adjustable to the size of your head. It is held together with a Velcro Strap and it stays on during the night. On the side of the Strap there are 2 sports for Ear Plugs. So this is the perfect thing to have when you are traveling or trying to get some nice sleep during the night. Currently I have used the Ear Plugs and they block out all the sound. When you are done with them in the morning or after your nap you can simply just push them back into the side of the Eye Mask for later.Overall, this Eye Mask is really comfortable and adjustable to your head. I was able to get better sleep because of the Eye Mask. I have used other Eye Mask in the past but this one is made a lot better and was able to stay on my head through out the night compared to other ones that I have used that simply go around the head but was not secure.If you are looking for better sleep during the night, I highly recommend this Eye Mask, it is nice and cheap and it will definitely help you get better sleep in the night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SZ3GR8HAXI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQ3IKCQ#wasThisHelpful","R26SZ3GR8HAXI7","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was able to replace my pepper shaker with this one and with this one I am able to grind pepper and salt as well.

On each side of the grinder you will find that it is made out of Stainless Steel. When you need to refill each side, it is very easy, all you need to do is unscrew it and put more Salt or Pepper in. Grinding Pepper and Salt down into smaller pieces is really nice with this grinder, it makes it nice and small. It uses a Ceramic Mechanism to grind down the pepper and salt.Overall, this is a really nice grinder because you are able to save on space.

"This is perfect for your outdoor needs. This comes with 2 bracelets and they are both different colors. One is Black and the other is like a Army Green. I personally have not untied the bracelet yet but it might come in handy in the future.The bracelets are tough and can carry up to 500 Pounds and it is guaranteed that it can carry 350 pounds for sure. On the bracelet you will find the Paracord, the main component of the bracelet. You will also find a Whistle, Flint Fire Starter and a Scarper. The Scarper can be used as a Knife as well. After removing the coating from the Flint Fire Starter I was able to get sparks with the scraper.With one of them around my wrist and the other one in my backpack, I was ready to go in case of an emergency or something were to happen.Overall, the 2 paracord are nice and durable and will help you out if you need them when you are out hiking or even camping.

"This power bank is nice and stylish and looks amazing! First thing out of the box it was really nice looking with no finger prints on it at all but after a while of using it does gather finger prints because it has a glossy finish.Going over the design of the power. It has a box design to the power bank itself. It has some nice weight to the power bank which is really nice. On the front and the back of the power bank it has a glossy finish. Since I got the power bank in a black color it does gather a bit of finger prints compared to other colors. I have used many other power banks and none of them had a digital indicator to tell how much power is left on the battery like this one does. It is really nice to know exactly what percentage of power that I have left on the power bank. Located on the side of the power bank you will find a button you can press to see the digital indicator or battery left on the power bank. On the top of the power bank there are 2 USB Ports so you can charge 2 Devices at once.

"This is just perfect for all my needs, I have been using a normal power strip for my outlets and I would always need an adapter to plug a USB Cable  into the outlet. But now with the Elivebuy Power Center I am able to just plug my USB Cables directly into the power strip.The Power strip is quite small and it fits right under my bed when I need to charge my devices at night. The power strip has a nice matte finish to it and it feels really smooth. The length of the cable is perfect for my needs, I am able to plug it in the outlet in the wall under my bed and bring it all the way to the front of the bed with no problems at all.Comparing the power strip to my old on that I used this one splits the outlets in half instead of having them all in a row. With them being split it is easier to plug an adapter into the power strip without it bother any other adapter. On the end of the power strip there are USB Port so I can simply just plug my Micro USB Cable into the Power Strip and connect it to my phone and I am good to go. There are a total of 6 Outlets and 5 USB Ports. For the USB Ports. 3 of them give out 1 Amp of Power while the other 2 give out 2.4 Amps of Power for a faster Charging.When you are not using the power strip there is a switch on the top where you can use it to turn it off so none of the outlets or the USB Ports will work.Really Nice Power Strip over all because you are able to connect you USB Cable direct to the Port instead of having an adapter going into the outlet. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a Power Strip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143X80GLQ9KYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBBRJYQ#wasThisHelpful","R143X80GLQ9KYQ","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This battery case is by far the best one that I have for my iPhone 6. It is durable and protects my iPhone 6 from getting damaged as well charge my phone at the same time.Going over the design of the case. It is made out of a Plastic material but has a piece of Aluminium on the back of the case to make it look stylish. Going around the battery case itself. Along the side of the case you will find hard pieces of plastic that will protect your phone from getting damaged when the phone drops to the ground. All the buttons are covered up. At first they do feel a bit hard to press but once you get use to it, it is rather easy to press. The Silent switch as well as the camera cut out are perfect. One the bottom of the case the headphone jack is there but it is quite deep so you will not be able to plug in your headphones. They have included an adapter that will fit and you will be able to use any headphones you wish.Installing the phone into the battery case is rather simply. All you need to do is un-clip the 2 locking pieces near the top of the case and remove the piece and slide you phone down into the case. Then attach the piece back to the top and lock it back into place. The locking mechanism on the case is a really nice to keep the phone secure into the case. When the case is installed it will protect your phone on the screen as well because it does have a lay on the table design so if you drop it on the screen it will be protected.This case for the iPhone 6 is really nice and works like a charm, It does add a little bit of bulk and weight to the phone but it does not bother me at all. On the bottom of the case you will find a Micro USB Port where you can charge the case and sync your phone with out removing the case. When I have this case on, it slides into my pocket quite nice, it has a matte finish to it so it feels great in the hand.The battery for this is a 3,500 mAh battery. With that amount of power I was able to get about 2 full charges. You can see how much power is left on the case by pressing the button on the back of the case. I noticed that when there is no phone in the case and you press the button the lights do not come on. In order to see the LED Lights you will need to press and hold the button for a few seconds. When you have your phone installed, you will need to press and hold the button to begin the charging. There are a total of 4 LED lights.1 LED Light - 0%-25% Charge2 LED Lights - 25%-50% Charge3 LED Lights - 50%-75% Charge4 LED Lights - 75%-100% ChargePackage Contents:*iPhone 6 Battery Case*Micro USB Cable*Headphone Extender*User ManualOverall, this is a great case that will charge your phone when you need to charge your phone. It is also a great case for protection as well. If you are looking to charge your phone with protection, this is the one to go with. While some people say it is hard to remove the case, I found it quite easy. If you have a screen protector on you iPhone and when you install the case the screen protector might cause it to have a tighter fit which means harder to remove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C303U76NL4NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLQFDK#wasThisHelpful","R2C303U76NL4NP","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great Sounding Headset. I've been using this for a week now and it is simply amazing. When I am in a phone call the other person on the other side is able to hear me nice and clear and I am able to hear the other person clearly as well.Going over the design of the headset. It is made out of a plastic material and it feel quite nice. When I have it in my ear it nice and comfortable and fits nicely into my ear. The headset has a matte finish to in on the back of the headset while on the front layer it is more of a plastic finish. I really enjoy the way how the heat set looks and feels. Along the side of the headset you will find a button that you can press to change the volume on the headset itself. It is just a single button so it will beep when it is at the loudest setting and the next time you press it, it will go down to the lowest volume. When you press and hold that button it will play the next track. On the front of the headset there is a single button that you can press to Play/Pause the Music. When you hold that button it will turn of the speaker on and Off. When you are getting a call all you need to do is press this button and it will answer the call for you, it is also the button that hangs up the calls.This headset is really nice and has a long battery life to it. I've used this for an entire day listening to music and it works like a charm. On this headset it has 2 microphones so it is really nice because the person on the other side receive the call will be able to hear you nice and clear.

As for continuous music listening I can get up to 6 hours.Paring the headset is quite easy, all you need to do is press and hold the button on the front of the headset for a few seconds after it has powered on and you will see a Blue and Red LED Light flashing. Meaning that the headset is ready to be paired to. All that is left to do is go on your phone and go to your Bluetooth Settings and connect to the head set and you are good to go,The sound quality of the headset is quite nice but it does not have that much bass, which can be expected because it is a headset not a pair of headphones. When listening to other people talk it is nice and clear. Sound on the headset is really nice and sound great. When I have the headset in, it feels like there is nothing there because it is so light and feels great in the ear.If you are looking for a headset for a great price, I would recommend this one because it has 2 microphones instead of one so it will result in a more clear sound for the other person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UWAMQML186G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6YYQDC#wasThisHelpful","R38UWAMQML186G","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 8:23 Mins This Projector is nice and small and can be brought on a Trip or can just be used to watch movies at home. I am currently using it in my room and it works great! Great to use when you want to watch a movie and just lay down to watch it.Going over the design of the projector. It is made out of a plastic material and it is nice and small and portable. On the projector you will find the following ports USB, 3-in-1 AV in, SD card, VGA, 3.5mm earphone. I currently use the projector to watch movies in the dark and the image on the projector is quite nice and clear when the room is dark. When the room is lit the image is still visible just slightly but you won't be able to see it much. Currently in my room, the projector is 10-15 feet away from my wall and the image of the projector is quite large and clear. I am able to see the pixels if I go close up to the wall.On this projector there are 2 ways you can use it. You can use the power cable that is included with the projector or if you don't have access to a wall outlet but have a power bank, you can simply just plug a micro USB cable to the projector and the projector will work like a charm. One thing that I did notice is that the image with a power bank is that the image is a bit darker than using it with a Wall Adapter.The buttons on the Projector are nice and responsive and work every time that I press them. All the controls that are on the projector are also located on the remote that the projector comes with. The Volume on the projector does get loud. I was able to have the projector running in my room and I would lay in my bed and be able to hear it nicely. At some points when the Volume is too loud the sound on the projector does distort.My current setup for the projector is that it is connected to my computer with a HDMI Cable. When it was connected it recognized my computer and started to project the image right away. I have a sound system in my room so instead of the sound coming from the projector, it goes to my sound system.The projector is nice and small but I would not recommend it for presentation for work or anything but I just recommend it for using it at home and watching movies.If you are looking for a nice projector that has great image quality and works great, I highly recommend this projector to anyone that is looking for one.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZX8C2V51YEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBTFIZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3JZX8C2V51YEE","A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZ0LNUC7TTXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Swiss Legend Neptune Force is probably a very capable watch.  Unfortunately, it's not just big but heavy, meaning that it's likely to stay in its case instead of on your wrist.  A star off for the weight and another for the wildly oversized band leave this at 3 stars.Oversized watches have become wildly fashionable, and the Neptune Force fits that category.  In this case, though, it's not just large but heavy, weighing in at over 11 ounces, or nearly 3/4 of a pound, when most competitors end up being about 2/3rds or less of that weight.  It's also far less elegant than the pictures imply, as the large bezel is backed up by an even larger rubber gasket.  In short, it's clunky, and not something you're likely to wear - at least for very long.The other problem here is that the wristband is far too large.  Even with an extremely large wrist you're going to need to remove links - this feels roughly like it's set for someone with 9"" wrists - but the instruction manual doesn't provide instructions on how to do so for end users, and in fact threatens to void your warranty if you do.The one potential use of this is as a backup diving watch; the manual does indicate that it's certified for use except for dives at trimix depths (although since it's theoretically certified to 330m, that shouldn't be an issue).  Most dive watches, however, make sure to have stopwatches and glow in the dark bezels, so it wouldn't necessarily do that well.3 stars.  Bit too bulky for everyday use even with a replacement wristband, and not really what you'd want to use for diving.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U15AU6URWTEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5F72Q#wasThisHelpful","R3U15AU6URWTEG","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"L.E. Modesitt's ""Solar Express"" borrows a little bit from Rendezvous with Rama and a lot more from Modesitt's previous explorations of a post-ecological disaster Earth.  The combination works reasonably well, but it doesn't rise to the levels of his best science fiction as the underlying story takes too long to develop and the worldbuilding isn't as compelling as some of his other work.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.While the prolific Modesitt is best known for his sweeping fantasy sagas, he also has written a substantial amount of science fiction.  It is generally set in a far distant future where the Earth has gone through a series of ecological disasters and wars, painfully come to a more sustainable society, and had survivors spread throughout the galaxy.  Much of it is informally linked with recurring aliens, governments, and cultures.  Solar Express is a little different and largely standalone.  Set only a century ahead, Earth has suffered the effects of global warming and a series of limited but devastating wars, but readers will recognize modern day political conflicts, culture, and science and technology.  The last shouldn't be surprising as this is the second entry in the Tor-NASA partnership of ""NASA-Inspired Works of Fiction"", meaning the science writing here was likely reviewed by Goddard Center staff as part of the project.Into this framework, Modesitt drops a Rama-like event: a probe heading towards the sun that ends up being humanity's first ever contact with aliens.  The entry point is an astronomer who first detects it, followed by a military pilot who ends up being assigned to investigate it.  In between, there are a number of crises involving the remaining superpowers on earth that spill over into space, dangers for the pilot investigating the probe, and a semi-repressed You've-Got-Mail-esque situation brewing between the pilot and the astronomer that's typical of Modesitt's teeth gnashing attempts at romance writing.In general, the plot tends to stutter a bit compared to his better scifi.  Part of this is that the story of the alien craft isn't at Rama-levels, or even Chindi ones. Overall, the stakes of finding the probe don't matter all that much; the world is a lot more focused on potential conflict between superpowers than in shock over proof that aliens exist.  The other issue is that Modesitt's usual strengths don't work as well as they normally do, probably because of the time frame.  The author is usually superb at building future societies, cultures, and militaries which are far more believable than most of his peers.  In this, though, the worldbuilding doesn't feel as solid, probably because modern-day structures still exist but also because some of the edges feel a bit frayed.  For instance, one subplot involving military monitoring of communication between the astronomer and pilot just doesn't feel particularly consistent.All this adds up to a fairly slow moving plot.  By the time Modesitt shows his cards and reveals a couple of true crises and their resolutions, most readers will not be reading for the conclusion to a compelling plot, but simply to finish the book.  This is far from Modesitt's worst effort and this isn't awful science fiction, but it's also not Modesitt's best.  Still worth a quick read, though, so 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRB1GP693NLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765381958#wasThisHelpful","RMRB1GP693NLG","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Along with Lindt and Toblerone, Cailler is one of the three large export-oriented Swiss chocolate companies.  Their milk chocolate bar is thus about average Swiss chocolate - very good, certainly much better than the more sugary American equivalent, but nothing remarkable or exotic.Owned by Nestle since 1929, this is basically generic milk chocolate of the sort that you'd find if you walked into a European supermarket - except at about 2 times the price.  Even on Amazon with shipping built in, it's still a good 20% over the price of what you can order it for online over there.On the whole, you're probably better off going to Pier One or such and browsing their chocolate selection.

"Robert Norrell's ""Alex Haley: And the Books That Changed a Nation"" provides a thorough accounting of the development and publishing of Malcolm X, Roots, and the Roots miniseries.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide nearly as deep a set of insights into the rest of Haley’s life, and Norrell’s choice not to pursue his own primary source research takes away from the overall richness of the book.  While it’s still worth reading, 3.5 stars rounded to 3 for the latter.Robert Norrell, a professor at Tennessee-Knoxville who has written extensively on race relations, the South, and Booker T. Washington, is the first established biographer to attempt to explain Haley.  It’s a more difficult challenge than most, partially because he’s competing directly with the several hours of sanitized autobiography Haley presented to audiences in Roots: the Next Generations.Unsurprisingly, Haley’s life was far more complex.  Norrell is on firmest ground when he describes the long process of how Haley produced The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Roots.  For the former, Haley established himself as a fairly proficient freelance writer, took on an incredibly difficult subject, and then spent far too much time writing the book while chasing many side projects thanks to financial difficulties generated from his divorce and the contract he signed for Malcolm X.  On the other hand, those difficulties led him to the lecture circuit, on which he not only survived for a number of years as a brilliant and lucrative speaker but also provided him with some of the insights and motivation to write Roots (and primed the market for its eventual release, having told the story of his history to a large audience for years before it came out.)Roots eventually produced almost as many problems for Haley as it did success; Haley was inclined to research – for which he was not trained, and in the process of which he was likely bamboozled – rather than write, eventually requiring a virtual co-author to finally finish the project.  Unfortunately, between his ever-firmer decision to market Roots as literal history rather than Herman Wouk-ish historical fiction along with accepting disastrous advice to settle questionable litigation (partially thanks to a vastly biased judge who probably would have had many of his rulings overturned on appeal), Haley’s reputation went to tatters following its release.  Norrell does a workman’s job in rehabilitating it; Haley made a lot of mistakes (“a likeable narcissist”), but they were generally not malicious and his overall contribution remains significant.Why 3 stars, then?  The biggest issue with the book is that it is mostly based off of a 6 year set of interviews with Haley that were intended for use in an authorized biography but never published due to the deaths of both the interviewer and subject.  An examination of the footnotes reveals that Norrell did very little primary source research of his own despite many of the principals still being alive.  Save for a handful of contacts surrounding the court cases, it does not appear that the author made any effort to reach out to those familiar with aspects of Haley's life; James Earl Jones, a close friend and one time tenant of Haley, would have been one prominent but obvious choice.This presents problems throughout the book, but where it becomes most noticeable is during the single short chapter on the quarter of Haley’s life that was spent in the Coast Guard.  Notwithstanding the publisher's carelessness on the blurb, “it was in the Navy that Haley discovered himself as a writer"", there are a number of contextual misunderstandings.  Race relations in the Coast Guard during Haley’s era are generally regarded by military historians as better than the other services – the Coast Guard commissioned its first African American officers before the Navy, and further back had a legendary commander – and a little bit of research would have revealed that Haley’s mentor in the Coast Guard not only taught him journalistic writing but selected him as the first African American ever to be nominated to attend the Coast Guard academy.  Later, there’s a reference that in 1972 “(Haley found) a berth on a wooden ship Eagle…so that he might know the feeling of sailing…like Kunta Kinte.”  Even the tiniest bit of interviewing would have showed this as the steel hulled Coast Guard barque cutter Eagle, on which his former service granted a famous former chief a few weeks sojourn to write without distraction.  His picture from this time on board apparently remains in the wardroom, where he wrote several chapters of Roots.  While the former story might have been more difficult to track down, the latter almost certainly has a prominent paper trail, and both hint that the author leaned far too strongly on existing papers housed near his campus than doing even pedestrian original research of his own.All this leads to the feeling that there’s more to the story that could have been told had Norrell been more thorough, and that’s a shame as the people who could have enriched it will likely not be around if and when someone else tackles the topic.  3.5 stars rounded down to 3, but still worth a read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABPLO278OHFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279605#wasThisHelpful","RABPLO278OHFY","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Woods 041456 surge protector is basically a cheap, generic 6 outlet power strip.  As such, it's priced appropriately.However, two things lead to three stars.  First, in general coaxial cable is something you don't want to attach to a surge protector, especially a cheap one.  It tends to cause all sorts of problems with digital signals with significant signal loss, most cable into a house is grounded, and in general unless you hook it up to a high end UPS with a line conditioner it's not going to do much good for protecting high end video equipment.Second, and more importantly, the attached picture shows the other problem with this.  The surge protector on the right is an older Belkin model which uses standard spacing between outlets.  On the left is the Woods 041456.  Like other Woods surge protectors, it uses much narrower than average spacing.  While you can actually plug two larger block units into the 6 outlets as the power switch is on the side, it's likely you won't be able to use all 6 with standard grounded plugs given the narrow spacing.3 stars.

"The Woods 041708 surge protector is a nice concept that gets slightly undermined by a few design flaws.  3 stars.The selling point on this unit is that you can use a master outlet that will turn off 4 other devices if the device attached to the master outlet is off.  It's a bit limited in practice.First, unless you have a reason to want all five devices to be turned on simultaneously, this isn't for you.  Second, for some bizarre reason the manufacturer decided to put the master control circuit on one of the six very narrow regular outlets.  (Basically, if you've got a device with a larger plug, you'll be losing one of the the 3 non-controlled outlets, and those are far slimmer than you'd ordinarily see.)  Furthermore, the warranty on this is a bit worrisome and the power switch is oddly on the side of the unit, rendering it vulnerable to feet and such despite being slightly recessed.The concept is far better executed by Belkin on one of their remote control 10 outlet adapters, where you can turn off 8 separate outlets and leave two others on at all times.  3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208IPBA373ZL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZY07UG#wasThisHelpful","R208IPBA373ZL0","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's been a lot already written about the Trendnet TEW-805UB, so just two points.The upside is that the latest PC drivers (dated September 2015) seem to have fixed most compatibility issues.  The adapter installed relatively easily.  Granted, this does not solve any of the potential manufacturing issues that have been long noted, but in this batch at least the stick worked fine.  It's also worth noting that the utility download is supposed to include a user's guide and a few other items and it didn't.  (It did include a wireless monitoring program that shows RFID channels without attempting to take over your wireless connection like so many others do.)The downside is that the adapter is relatively meh in what it actually should be doing - increasing range and speed.  50 feet from router using an -ac connection showed 72 MB/s and three bars; that's weaker than all but one adapter I've tested, and it never got above 300 MB/s even when close up.As such, three stars.

"As a biography, Harlow Unger’s “Henry Clay: America’s Greatest Statesman” doesn’t break much, if any, new ground on Clay.  However, where it proves unexpectedly superb is as a powerfully deep primer on pre-Civil War history and politics, with one of the clearest explanations of regional, partisan, and personal conflicts that ended up bringing the country to the brink.  3.5 stars for Clay and 5 for the primer place this at 4 stars.Unger’s writing on Clay is not particularly controversial; there is little revisionist grist.  Clay ended up being on the right side of history in most of his positions, and Unger doesn’t spend much time on the two most obvious areas in which he wasn’t, the War of 1812 and the strengthening of the Fugitive Slave Act.  Nor does Unger spend much time either praising or criticizing Clay; that is left to frequent quotes from Abraham Lincoln, who as a Clay supporter in his formative years waxes effusive.  Instead, Unger’s main focus is on integrating Clay and his positions into the political currents of the era, and in that he does a superb job.Unger presents Clay as a brilliant mediator, policy visionary, and proto-Beltway insider who often had the popular political instincts of a blind elephant charging into a china shop.  With this, Clay’s oft-quoted “I would rather be right than be President” takes on a different tone here, as many of his worst missteps were self-inflected.  From 1824, when his naive lack of comprehension of what becoming Secretary of State would do to both his reputation and to his relationship with Andrew Jackson, to 1839, when his failure to do any political groundwork prior to the Whig convention led to the eventual ascension of the utterly disastrous Tyler presidency, Clay’s political strategy often failed miserably.  While Unger doesn’t argue this and generally lauds his subject, there's enough here that a different writer might actually make a case that Clay’s ineptitude outside legislative chambers at times almost offset his contributions within them.As such, it’s hard to view this as a groundbreaking biography of Clay, since most of the material is neither new nor supports the title’s thesis.  Even with extensive coverage of the horrible tragedies to befall his children, Clay tends to fade into the page save for a few moments - the willingness to take on Aaron Burr as a pro bono client against Jefferson's crusade is one - and his repeated absences from Congress usually end with a sentence or two about the interregnum ending without any detail on what prompted him to accept a return.  However, this is more than offset by Unger’s integration of the entire political context of the pre-Civil War era by using Clay as the prism of it.  Clay’s fingers were on nearly every policy debate from the War of 1812 to the Compromise of 1850, and Unger’s simple and clear explanations of how history developed around this are very much worth reading even for those familiar with the time.  Anyone looking to understand how the United States evolved from the Revolutionary Era to the Civil War will benefit from this book.4 stars, and very much worth a read for anyone interested in the development of American democracy.Disclosure: This impartial review was made possible by the publisher providing a copy of the ARC of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0GDIYLHIT9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306823918#wasThisHelpful","R2N0GDIYLHIT9K","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bushnell's Rubicon Micro Lantern is a nifty niche product largely designed for camping.  However, its best use is likely reading maps or charts at night.  A few omissions leave this at 4 stars.There's been a lot already said about this, but to reiterate, this has about 2 hours of battery life at the highest intensity setting (close to a flashlight) and up to 18 hours at the lowest (roughly candlelight).  A USB rechargeable battery that's relatively low drain means a solar pack and this would get along pretty well.However, the most interesting aspect of this is the red mode, lasting 9 hours and using a separate set of 6 LEDs.  It's a very bright but authentic (not filtered) red, and should work fairly well for reading charts at night on a boat without losing night vision.A star off as the USB cable really should have a place to be stored under the unit, along with no ability to lock the unit out from being turned on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5RK6I4ZCNUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9N1HDI#wasThisHelpful","RU5RK6I4ZCNUC","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Denon's AHGC20 Globe Cruiser headphones are essentially a jack of all trades piece of equipment; they are competent at most things you'd look for in a set of headphones, but nothing about them is spectacular.  With some curious decisions in sound balance, accessories, and a high end price tag, this warrants 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 as overall, they're competent - just probably not worth what you're spending on them.Denon's entry into the high end active noise reduction category seems to have been designed by engineers with a checklist.  Good ANC without hiss?  Check.  Bluetooth functionality and fairly decent battery life (around 18 hours)?  Check.  Relatively lightweight and compact (10 oz for the headphones, 7 ounces for the case)?  Check.The result is a set of headphones that feels more like it's supposed to do a lot things fairly well than become best in class; in other words, it's kind of like most American cars in the 1990s, where they proved perfectly fine to drive - just not terribly exciting.  To begin, those with larger ears may find the ear coverings uncomfortable, as they're 4 cm by 6 cm.  While you can fit your ears between them and the speakers, after a few hours it tends to get a bit cramped.Frequency response is simply awful without ANC, with bass being so prevalent to outright distort any media to the point where it's not listenable.  With ANC, it's somewhat more balanced, but still very bass heavy.  This isn't uncommon on many noise reduced closed air units, but the AHGC20 takes this to new levels.  Compared to something like the Shure SRH1440, the difference is night and day.  It's not entirely a fair comparison given the open air/closed air headset, but it's extreme.As far as the ANC goes, it's very good.  Engine plane noise is down significantly, and you could theoretically wear these in any situation involving screaming children and come out somewhat sane at the end.  Unlike the first and second generation ANC sets, there is no hiss whatsoever.  However, that being said, in direct comparison to the Bose QC 25, the noise reduction on the latter is notably more significant.  For far superior sound quality with good passive noise reduction, the Etymotic Research ER4P-T's would be a better choice.Bluetooth functionality here is certainly useful, and a step ahead of the Beats Studio Wireless with several more functions and a much more robust integration with phone controls, including taking and speaking on calls.  However, in one of the more strange decisions made in this design, the included manual does not describe all Bluetooth functionality; you have to get to a website to learn such basic features as how to actually turn off both Bluetooth and the headphones.Finally, Denon makes a very strange decision to include only a 1 1/2' USB cable (most are 3') and a 4 1/2' wired cable (most are 7').All in all, these are decent enough headphones to haul around for everyday use, but if you're looking for a concert on a plane, try the Etymotics.  If you want true noise reduction, try the Boses.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GE9FPXAB00SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXQH1FC#wasThisHelpful","R1GE9FPXAB00SY","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About halfway through Joe Abercrombie's conclusion to the Shattered Sea trilogy, ""Half a War,"" a chapter titled ""Too Many Ministers"" pops up.  It's neither a long nor an important one, but it inadvertently describes many of the problems Abercrombie has written himself into here.  Too many new main and supporting characters get introduced, previous ones who have been clearly defined and been the major focus are reduced to near cameos, and in general the narrative isn't compelling.  Some readers may be satisfied given Abercrombie's typical grit, but perhaps the most appropriate comparison is the controversial conclusion to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, A Memory of Light.  3 stars.Abercrombie's first book of the series, Half a King, was one of the very best young hero journeys of recent years, with flawed characters making bad decisions and paying for them in a very brutal world.  The second, Half the World, took significant creative risks in bringing in an entirely new set of main characters but also ran into some problems, in part by following typical YA tropes and some questionable plot decisions.Half a War continues the same creative risks of Half the World as it introduces yet another set of new characters, but with only 400 pages left along with layering in characters from not one but two previous books, this turns out to be less risk and more mess.  Even if Abercrombie had done this perfectly, structural problems inherent in trying to introduce and grow a number of new characters while severely rationing stage time for others who have received hundreds of pages of development would make most writers and editors wary of this route.Abercrombie compounds this with his G.R.R. Martin-eqsue love of routinely killing off significant characters.  While this is usually a strong positive for his gritty and dark writing, here it backfires.  There's nothing at all wrong with killing off characters that readers have invested in, especially in a conclusion to a series, and Abercrombie does try to give some of the more significant ones a decent sendoff.  However, when their actions and deaths appear largely expedient to either swiftly wrap up inconvenient threads or create new, rushed ones for recently introduced characters, not just their deaths but their plot lines feel shortchanged.  There's an uncomfortable similarity to the conclusion of the Wheel of Time here; while the combination of frenetic mop ups and new characters don't quite reach the same bipolar pace that they do in A Memory of Light, it does have much the same feel.The final blow is that the main protagonist, Skara, sadly shares a lot more with Thorn than Yarvi.  She's incredibly talented for a teenager, she almost never makes a mistake, she's got few flaws, she's never in any real danger, and despite all her youth she's capable of outwitting almost everyone from the beginning of the novel.  She brings in allies, turns them to her cause, and in general runs over her problems rather than growing from her mistakes.  With Half a War largely consisting of battles, strategy, and their aftermath, her role is played largely from the sidelines - problematic for a main character.  Add in that the  largest movement in the plot comes from deus ex superweapons, and between the two, it's a bit frustrating.How does all of this add up to even a three star novel, then?  Two reasons.  First, the world and elf culture get revealed a bit more.  Second, Abercrombie is still good at moving the plot along with showing just a nasty world these folks live in, and that counts for something.  Still, it's a real shame that what was one of the most promising series in a while ends up with a whimper rather than a bang.  Three stars, and it's good that it's over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358YVCZ88VPDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178453#wasThisHelpful","R358YVCZ88VPDI","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike most recent entries into the dystopian sweepstakes, Claire Vaye Watkins' debut novel, ""Gold Fame Citrus"", contains some of the more impressive prose of any genre in recent memory.  Unfortunately, Watkins appears far more intent on demonstrating her technical prowess than composing a readable novel, with characters, background, and plot lines seemingly far less important than attempting to overwhelm the reader with just how powerfully she can write a scene.  The result is a hot mess not dissimilar to that of the second season of True Detective.  5 stars for the prose and 1 star for the plot average this out at 3 stars.Watkins can write.  The author has has won all sorts of awards and plaudits for her short stories, and most relevantly for this novel, has a far better understanding of some of the underlying social factors of the West than most of today's authors.  Thus, a prolonged, cataclysmic drought that has destroyed California, good parts of the Southwest, and upended society should be a good starting point for her first novel.  On some levels it is: salt overwhelms the Central Valley, states refuse to help other states and refugees, government is impotent, a preacher appears in the desert, there's a dowser, and so forth.Watkins' inability to tie any of this together, though, proves a fatal flaw and starts from nearly the first page with the main character, Luz.  It's not just that her protagonist is not particularly sympathetic; it's that Watkins spends significant effort in establishing her as the incarnation of governmental impotence and futility (quite literally, the poster child of conservation gone wrong) and then never does anything with it for the rest of the book.  The poster child theme is just the first of a plethora of different ones which get duly started and then proceed to absolutely nowhere.  Watkins delights in creating background that never develops, and the effect is much like looking at a technically gorgeous tapestry, that, when viewed from a bit close up, has sloppy strands and loops sticking out all over the place.Luz and her boyfriend adopt a child, flee from LA, and don't really do very much while Watkins briefly brings various characters and scenarios in and out.  None of this matters much for where the book meanders, let alone concludes, and Watkins compounds her problems by throwing in all sorts of useless material - a government application for work, a fauna description, third person narratives - that just don't seem relevant while they're introduced.  This isn't uncommon for the current vein of literature that disdains plot, but it's disappointing for a writer of her caliber and it's curious that the editorial process didn't clean up much of the frippery.The result of all this for many readers will be an effect that is oddly similar to watching True Detective's second season: recognition that it is technically inspiring, appreciation for a deep understanding of California's background and underside, and guffaws at a plot and characters that only the writer and a few fans can take seriously.  Watkins will undoubtedly get some literary plaudits for this, but on the whole this is best reserved for those looking to learn a little bit about technical writing.  Otherwise, it should be avoided by those interested in reading a coherent novel.  3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGTEBZCUON6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634238#wasThisHelpful","R1IGTEBZCUON6C","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is gum, so there's not too much profound wisdom to be shared about it.Spearmint and peppermint have three packs; sweet mint and wintermint two.  Sweet mint is perhaps the best of the bunch but its flavor will expire within a few minutes.  Peppermint is quite strong and can last in the range of ten.  This does contain xylitol, which kills bacteria in the mouth and means the various flavors are not a bad choice for after snacking, as many dentists recommend xylitol gum for periodontal purposes.  (Keep it away from dogs and cats, however, as small doses can kill them.)  The sticks are somewhat larger than those found in Trident boxes, although they do go bad fairly quickly.Why 3 stars?

"Adam Makos' ""Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice"" tells two tales: a heroic effort by a couple of pilots, and a longer tale of how the pilots got there.  While the main incident is well told, Makos has some difficulty with the background and B-stories required to stretch it to book length.  The result is a book that is still very much worth reading but not at the level of his previous work.  4 stars.Makos gained well deserved notoriety with his previous book A Higher Call, one of the better untold tales of World War II that came to light in the twilight years of the men who fought it.  That book worked on many levels; while the escort of the damaged bomber by a Luftwaffe pilot was itself remarkable, the biography of that pilot, Franz Stigler, was even better.Devotion follows the model of the previous book, where hundreds of pages of background take place before the incident involving Jesse Brown and Tom Hudner - where one pilot gets shot down and the other makes a heroic choice.  The incident and the followup to it take up about 75 pages and 4 chapters, and is well done.  The problem becomes the other 325 pages, where Makos' back story doesn't work as well.There are a few reasons for this; among the first is that Makos makes a number of  curious editorial decisions, not the least of which is hiding the results of the incident until late in the book.  This is also Makos' first exposure to the Korean War, and while the bibliography and interviews show a good deal of research, it's also pretty clear that he's not on the same firm ground as he was in Higher Call with years of study.In turn, that shows up in how he sets up the background here.  While the childhood history of the pilots makes sense, especially for Brown, the first African American to serve as a Naval aviator, the two years before in between their naval service and the advent of the Korean War aren't particularly compelling.  Brown's encounters with racism are quite interesting (the casual hatred he received from other African Americans in the Navy, along with a notable scene where he's refused service in a bar not in the South but in San Diego), but otherwise the backstory is more or less a Med cruise with the highlight being a bunch of sailors and Marines from the Leyte hanging out with a young Liz Taylor.  That Makos chooses to focus on this rather than things like the move by the Navy to jets and the resulting politics along with the events that led up to the Korean War is a problem.In turn, this means that when Makos does get to Korea the story doesn't have the heft it deserves.  The battle at the Chosin Reservoir was described by S.L.A. Marshall as ""the most violent small unit fighting in the history of American warfare"", yet Makos recounts only a few incidents with Marines that were attached to it, and of those he doesn't weave them compellingly.  A incident he describes that was heroic enough so that a Medal of Honor was later rewarded receives little coverage, Army units receive short shrift, and foreign units receive no attention at all.While this certainly focuses attention on Brown and Hudner, there are a lot of incredible stories from Chosin, and the workmanlike telling of the battle (and backstories prior to their involvement) means the book feels like it's missing a couple of cylinders.  It's not a bad book by any means, and the story of Brown and Hudner is worth retelling.  However, other books have told the individual stories better - a number of books have been published on Chosin, and there's been one by the Naval Institute on Brown and Hudner - and Makos could have weaved a better tale here.In sum, worth a read and it's great to see this story getting wider coverage after 60 years, but Makos doesn't cover much new ground here.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0W8NL5AY71M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176582#wasThisHelpful","R2W0W8NL5AY71M","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nisid Hajari's ""Midnight Furies"" is a frightening look at the ethnic cleansings and boneheaded politics that helped create modern day India and Pakistan.  While most modern writers on both sides concentrate solely on the Kashmir, Hajari goes further into the conflict by including the bloodbaths that occurred in the Punjab and bringing the political background that made this possible.  A star off for bringing in minor players that overtly complicate the book and for not providing a bit more background on historic Muslim-Hindu-Sikh relationships before World War I, but overall a disturbing but important book.  4 stars.As Hajari notes, save for the uplifting story of Gandhi most Westerners know little about India's evolution from vassal to independent state.  Unfortunately, there is good reason for this: the story of the birth of Pakistan and India is not one that most of its participants would like told, as it involved ethnic cleansing and mass murder that can only be compared to Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, or any number of countries following World War I.How did this happen?  The political leadership on both sides initially presented fairly firm positions but by all accounts were capable and interested in compromise, but after several incidents, those positions hardened from political posturing to outright hatred.  That gave cover for tolerance and, at times, direct encouragement for lower class proxies in the battle to encourage those who weren't coreligionists to flee, by fire, brutal violence, or simply outright murder.What started in the Punjab (Delhi was once an strongly integrated city, for instance) spread throughout the border regions, and the result was horrific.  Muslims attacked Hindus, Hindus attacked Muslims, Muslims attacked Sikhs, Sikhs attacked Muslims, and essentially, no governmental or religious organization made an effort to stop them, and it's questionable that once the genie got out the bottle if any had the power to do so.  Gandhi, for instance, was assassinated by a radical Hindu organization that felt he betrayed all Hindus by going on a hunger strike to force India to live up to its agreement to release part of its reserves to a starving post-partition Pakistan.  The sad irony is that following Gandhi's murder, Pakistan promptly used those newly released reserves for arms purchases instead of food.Besides the failure of Nehru and Jinnah, the political leadership of Britain bears particular blame as well.  While some of Britain's mistakes came from severe budgetary pressures - it's worth remembering that Britain's simultaneous withdrawal from Palestine was as much financial as much as it was the realization it couldn't govern the region any more - others were not.  Churchill's hatred for Indian independence leaders knew no bounds; while out of power, he met with Jinnah and offered his promise of unwavering support for the new Pakistan as long as they would offer their army to support the Commonwealth and continue to swear allegiance to King and Crown.  In turn, Attlee's government wasn't any better in their full voiced support for Nehru.There was more than just support, however.  Most notable was the incredibly stupid decision by Mountbatten to massively accelerate the removal of British control without any corresponding governmental plans - quite literally, borders were being drawn up by a Brit in the last week before independence - meaning governmental organization on independence was non-existent.  Moving from unbelievable to outright stupid is that in the case of Kashmir, the British-run Pakistan army had its British commander in chief planning to go to war against India's army, run by, of course, another British general.  Both armies were intended as bulwarks against the Soviet Union; instead, they promptly began killing each other instead.There are two major drawbacks to the book.  First, Hajari brings up such detailed political analysis that readers will often simply get lost in names that show up once or twice and then disappear into the woodwork without much understanding of how they related to the greater story.  Second, what would have helped significantly is a chapter or two on the historic fights over the Indian subcontinent, as while the author hints at some of the conflicts over princely states, it would have been very useful to go back a few centuries into the historical conflict between Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs.Still, an important if disturbing book.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35JXYS1VOWRHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547669216#wasThisHelpful","R35JXYS1VOWRHC","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Longerich's ""Goebbels: A Biography"" breaks new ground.  Using the recently published complete set of the Goebbels diaries, Longerich reveals a narcissistic and fawning academic who vastly overestimated his own talents and contributions, had no deepset political beliefs, and was often completely out of his depth.  While this will be a reference for years to come, 1.5 stars off as it is also a distinctly ponderous German academic work that often unnecessarily veers into psychobiography.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 to represent the importance of this work.With the 1992 discovery of the microfilmed Goebbels diaries in an archive in Russia and the resultant publishing of a massive, 29 volume German language edition finally concluding in 2009, Goebbels is the one Nazi figure well overdue for reevaluation thanks to the introduction of this significant new material.  Longerich, a German history professor at the University of London known for his work on the Holocaust and a superb biography of Heinrich Himmler, is the first academic to fully utilize Goebbels' writings to analyze the man in a way not available to past historians.This has both benefits and drawbacks. While the diaries are often a conscious attempt by Goebbels to inflate his role for the future historians of the thousand year Reich (at least until he became convinced defeat was inevitable by late 1944), when combined with Longerich's thorough review of the scattered alternative sources, they also inadvertently reveal the conflict between Goebbels' opinion of himself against that of his peers, superiors, and the historical record.That, more than anything else, is the focus of the book.  Goebbels and many of his prior biographers cultivated an image of an icy political and public relations genius who was intricately involved in Reich policy.  Longerich destroys this myth.  While Goebbels was free to experiment with public opinion, he was was largely ineffective as a politician, often marginalized by Hitler with opinions that were ignored by the leadership, and in general his greatest value to the party was that he was the best of the Nazi public speakers and could routinely draw and captivate a crowd.While the early years present some problems as the diaries do not commence in full until 1926, enough nuggets survive to reveal an interesting sketch.  Goebbels was a essentially a failed PhD with a club foot that held him back socially, got a marginal job at a newspaper, editorialized for the party, and then through luck and circumstance was introduced to party figures early on and slavishly promoted his master's ideology as his own.  Goebbels came from the left side of the NSDAP and advocated a far closer relationship with Russia until realizing Hitler was not in agreement, and without much in the way of second thoughts did a complete 180 to align himself with whatever Hitler wanted, something he continued for the rest of his life.Longerich uses these discrepancies and anecdotes to argue that the main driving force behind Goebbels' career was a desperate narcissistic craving for recognition.  While he is probably right, compared to other outright psychobiographies like The Immortal Ataturk: A Psychobiography, the analysis here often feels a bit armchair as it's not Longerich's specialty.  On the other hand, it does reveal many of the negative traits that crippled the man; it's hard to argue that Goebbels' own insecurities didn't help lead him into philandering (which Goebbels did aplenty, although perhaps the most interesting tidbit is the speculation about Hitler's interest in Magda Goebbels corresponding with the timing of his half-niece's suicide) and seeking security and patronage wherever he could find it.  Overall, though, Longerich is often better off when he narrates events than psychoanalyzing his subject.The other weakness of the book is that despite what is likely a masterful and thorough translation and editing job (apparently 3 separate translators worked on this over 5 years - the book was published in a German edition all the way back in 2010), this is very much a ponderous academic tomb in the German tradition.  This isn't unexpected given the writer and source material, but readers used to more accessible English language, non-academic biographies will find this ponderous at best.While this is not nearly as accessible as other biographies on inner circle Nazi leaders and may turn off lay readers with its depth, it is a groundbreaking academic work that should be on the shelf of anyone concerned with Nazi leadership.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.Disclosure: This impartial review was made possible by the publisher providing a copy of the ARC of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OD1NTMPFRBWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067510#wasThisHelpful","R2OD1NTMPFRBWB","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Black & Decker HF100WD is a decent enough specialized convection oven.  It does a good job on frozen fried food, an ok job on fresh food when oiled, and a so-so job on fresh food when not oiled.  4 stars despite the labeling.It's not apparent from many of the reviews, but B&D is late into the 'air fryer' game.  Philips created the concept in the UK five or so years ago - a convection oven that has a pull out drawer in the form of a fry basket.  This got Philips into a whole lot of trouble with the UK agency that deals with advertising claims, as Philips went on and on about the health benefits of 'air frying' when all they were doing was selling a convection oven with the fans slightly different.  This may have been why it took several years more to get the same models into the US.B&D's entry operates largely the same as Philips with a few less electronic controls; indeed, the timer on this is manual, so that if you unplug the HF100WD early, it'll still tick off until you hit the bell signifying that time is up.  Given that it is about half the price, this is well worth the tradeoff.These are actually quite good at preparing store bought frozen junk food, which generally contains a decent amount of oil in the package.  The only downside is that things that can drip - think mozzarella sticks, or burgers - you're likely to end up with a bit of a mess to clean up, although the non stick basket and barrel are actually quite easy to clean.  A general rule of thumb is that cooking time on a convection oven is about 75% that of a conventional oven which seems to apply here to things like onion rings (which turned out well), but seems a bit longer for things that require baking all the way through like egg rolls (which also turned out far better than in a microwave or conventional oven.)  Other items that turned out well included chicken wings and tater tots.This isn't quite as good with home made french fries coated in olive oil, mostly because the basket is too small to line more than half a portion up evenly.  (In fact, B&D points out that you need to shake the basket with any French Fries.)  It worked well on turkey and chicken burgers with a little oil, but you're likely better off using other methods to cook salmon and baked potatoes.4 stars.  Most of what you'll cook in here you probably shouldn't be eating anyway, but it's marginally better than going to a fast food place, and if you're creative you can come up with healthier fare.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27S0B9JFN0ROX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJW2A#wasThisHelpful","R27S0B9JFN0ROX","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hershey's Kisses don't need much of a product review besides, perhaps, ""burp.""  (That, and that this bag has 9200 calories in it.)Writing a review extolling Hershey's versus Cadbury versus Ghiradelli is kind of irrelevant as you already know which chocolate you like.  You're not going to be buying 4 lbs of chocolate if you've made it to the point where you've a. got a credit card and b. have somehow navigated your life to that level of financial responsibility without having sampled Hershey's before.The only notable comparison here, then, is the pricing.  That's more interesting since it works out to $0.073 per Kiss for each of the 464 Kisses in the bag.  About 10 seconds of work online will show you that you can get a 40 ounce bag that works out to $0.03 per Kiss, or a 12 ounce bag that works out to about $0.048 per Kiss, both available from large box stores without membership requirements.Both of those are far better deals than this, so a 3 star rating is appropriate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JII6N6CB3YBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3WWWXI#wasThisHelpful","R2JII6N6CB3YBQ","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Maytex Thermal Shield Kaylee Panel sells at a premium for its effectiveness.  In general, you'll be better off buying sew-on light blocking fabric.Based on previous reviews, it's not clear that many reviewers are familiar with light blocking fabric, which is routinely available at most craft stores.  It's a fairly heavy blend with two or three layers in white, and it blocks heat and light extremely effectively.In contrast, the Maytex panel is quite lightweight with a single greyish - not white - layer that covers about 90% of the back of the burgundy fabric, excepting the top.  This means that there is significant light seepage from the top of the panel regardless of how it's mounted.  There are velcro attachments at the side of the panel, but they are spaced about 2 feet apart so there will likely be both heat and light seepage from that as well.As other reviewers have noted, a 50"" x 84"" panel is not enough to provide coverage for most windows, so you'll need two panels that have something like 3-4"" of overlap.3 stars.

"Bissell's SpotClean ProHeat Cleaner is really more of a cleaning solution applicator than a true spot cleaner.  While it's appropriately priced for the functionality, you're probably better off either spending significantly more on a true steam cleaner or renting one if you need to deep clean surfaces more frequently.  3 stars.There's been a lot written on this so far, so just a few points.  The most important one is that despite the ProHeat name, this basically just takes the warm (but not hot) temperature water you've put in the unit and uses it to dilute and wash the cleaner you've added.  It also doesn't have any attachments that loosen dirt or stains by beating the surface.  Basically, you're just shampooing with rather expensive Bissell cleaning solutions; unsurprisingly, Bissell isn't going to market this as a shampoo applicator.Compared to an older freestanding Bissell vacuum/cleaning model, this isn't bad, since it does about 80% of the same cleaning in about 1/4 the package.  Compared to a true steam cleaner like the wildly expensive but incredibly powerful Ladybug line, though, the difference is night and day.  As such, it's not the worst thing to have in your arsenal, but there are probably better values out there.  3 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCM7ONRZWXI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBA5N26#wasThisHelpful","R3NCM7ONRZWXI8","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Miele C2 is a decent canister vacuum, but compared to a top tier model like the S658i Blue Moon it's definitely entry level.  While the unit has plenty of power at 1200 watts, a star off as the included STB 205-3 isn't one of Miele's better attachments and suffers in comparison to the high end versions.  4 stars, however, as the parquet cleaner is good and as nearly the least expensive of the compact canisters, it's a very good base if you'd like to upgrade.If you're reading this review, you are likely familiar with Miele's well deserved reputation for great vacuums.  Within the Miele lines, though, there are definite differences.  Among them is that the C2 is the compact version of the canister models and is about 2 lbs lighter than the latest version of the traditional canisters like the C1 or the higher end C3.  (It also uses a smaller dust bag, the FJM series.)This isn't to say that this isn't a decent enough vacuum as is.  The 1200 watts here is equivalent to what Miele had on its highest end vacuums a decade ago, and compared to a Hoover or Electrolux or such it does a better job.  However, when compared head-to-head against one of those highest end models, the legendary Blue Moon, carpeting just didn't quite feel as clean.The blame here probably lies in the compact STB 205-3 Turbo Plus rotating roller brush attachment.  It just doesn't seem like it gets deep into the carpet the way the Blue Moon's venerable SEB 217-B does.  Nor does this include a HEPA filter, which those with dust mite allergies will find is essential.  On the other hand, the Miele Parquett Twister SBB 300-3 is a good bare floor accessory, and the VarioClip attachment holder is a nice upgrade over leaving small brushes sitting around.Where this has true potential is to use it as a base to get a true high end Miele.  You can buy your own HEPA filter, the SF-HA 50 HEPA 13, replace the STB 205-3 with the higher end SEB 236 Powerbrush found on the top end C3s, and swap out the SBB 300-3 with the larger Miele SBB 400-3 Parquet Twister XL.  Sell off the original parts for a reasonable amount, and for about $100-150 more than the list here you end up with a vacuum which has almost all the capabilities of the highest end C3, the C3 Brilliant at about half the price and 3/4 of the weight.Experienced Miele owners know that if you're looking for a relative bargain in a wildly expensive brand you're generally better off buying a lower end unit and upgrading it.  In a nutshell, that's exactly why the Miele C2 is an interesting vacuum.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KNLVNYX842G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGW2#wasThisHelpful","R5KNLVNYX842G","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer is one of those devices that you'd think should show up on a late night paid TV spot to theoretically solve a problem that you didn't know you had before you bought it, gave up after 5 minutes and threw it out, and several months later discovered it cost a lot more than $14.99 as your credit card number been stolen.  Instead, it unexpectedly does an effective job in efficiently trimming hair inside the nose.  Doesn't do the other marketed tricks, though, so 4 stars.There's a classic scene in About Last Night where Demi Moore is sleeplessly rummaging around in Rob Lowe's stuff, finds a weird device that she can't figure out, and Lowe wakes up to explain to her that it's a nose hair clipper.  Things have progressed in 30 years from the days of brass clippers, with a number of manufacturers producing battery operated trimmers.  Most of them don't work terribly well, since if you end up being off at all, they pull and pinch.  And hurt.  A lot.The NT3155/60 has a big blurb on the box about how its trimmer doesn't do that.  Surprisingly, you can press it up into the nasal cavity, it'll slice off hair, and it doesn't pull it at all.  It can take a little while to do it with the single AA battery powering it, but that's fine.  Easy to clean as well, since you just toss it under some warm water.The eyebrow attachment is marginally useless; the trimmer just doesn't have enough power if you've got any sort of length, and a traditional blade trimmer plus comb is far more efficient even if you don't.  You can theoretically stick this into your ear canal and trim hair there too, but any physician worth their while would advise against putting stuff in your ears.4 stars.

"Richard Rhodes' ""Hell and Good Company"" offers a different take on the Spanish Civil War.  Rather than delving into the political, social, or military aspects of the war, Rhodes provides an overview and then layers in some of the technological and medical advances along with a few cultural tales.  While many of these anecdotes are fascinating, the narrative would have been served by going into a bit more depth.  Even those quite familiar with the war will learn something, though, so 4 stars.Best known for the groundbreaking The Making of the Atomic Bomb and its sequels, Rhodes is one of the premier nonfiction and technical writers of his generation.  Among his gifts are the ability to make complex and densely layered subjects understandable to the lay reader while still satisfying the professional.  That type of writing requires significant primary source research, and in the case of the Spanish Civil War meant Rhodes turned to some of the writings by English speaking doctors, nurses, and writers.From that research, Rhodes can make an effective argument that the war shaped the world, or at least the next war, in a few areas.  Blood transfusion, storage, and several surgery techniques were largely refined during this period, and it is somewhat startling to see how far behind Spanish medicine was in comparison, particularly areas like disinfection and nursing.  The same goes for several military advances, and the author does make a good point on how the war introduced widespread civilian terror bombing to the Western world, along with the brutal practice of targeting medical providers.The rest of the military overview is a bit more spartan.  There are some interesting insights - most notably that the later truth that the republicans were badly outgunned was actually the opposite during the early part of the war thanks to Stalin's more modern weaponry - but in general this is an area in which additional depth would have helped significantly.  The numerous battles and fronts along with the oft-ignored Italian contribution are capably described albeit with great brevity, but the puzzling omission of maps in a book that at its base is about multiple military campaigns means readers will likely be lost more often than not.The political and social observations aren't quite as striking.  Hitler's motivations for aiding the nationalists are explored well (obtaining a base of supply of pyrites and distracting France and England while he rearmed Germany among them), but Stalin's goals are essentially absent, and the rancorous political debate outside Spain receives minimal coverage.  It's also a little disappointing to not see an author of Rhodes' talents at least attempt to untangle some of the confusing internecine struggles of left and right that drove large parts of the war, as those conflicts are still very much relevant even in 21st century Spain.  Rhodes does some exploration of how the war affected the work of Picasso and Miŕo, but much like the military overview readers familiar with the subject will likely be left wanting more.Like Rhodes' other works, this is extremely accessible and insightful where the author has interest, but unlike the rest of his writing it leaves the reader wanting more.

"Bad experience with this one, unfortunately.  Short review of the negatives:1. Never got -ac speeds with this; maxxed out around 180 MB/s, and did check to make sure adapter and router were properly set up.  Considering other USB adapter worked fine with -ac, unlikely it was on router or PC end.2. The clip that can potentially hold the adapter on the back of a laptop screen only works with an extremely narrow screen; a 1/4"" one proved too large, so you'd need an extremely thin bezel to attach it.  This is a shame, because the adapter is close to 2"" long and does stick out significantly if you attach it to the back of a laptop.3. After about a month of use, stopped working entirely and was returned.Second star is that it was a decent value for the money and it installed easily enough.

"""American Sniper"" has created a firestorm among viewers on both ends of the political spectrum.  Some will rank it 5 stars based on their views of the implied politics; others may rank it 1 for the stories it does not tell and the lack of subtlety in what it does.  My rank of 5 stars is based off of neither ideology nor its Oscar worthiness.  Instead, it is based off of how it addresses topics that will be very familiar to veterans - and deserves watching as a worthy entry point to those who aren't.A recent Washington Post wonkblog piece on successful war movies pulled up 36 since the late 1950s.  Many of those, however, have found lackluster support among active and retired service members and their families.  Fury, Inglorious Bastards, Hart's War, Behind Enemy Lines, Pearl Harbor and even Hurt Locker were movies that proved hits but rang hollow to those familiar with how the military actually works.In fact, of the 36 films listed, only 5 received generally good reviews from both veterans and critics:  Blackhawk Down, Bridge on the River Kwai, Full Metal Jacket, Das Boot, and Saving Private Ryan.  Of war movies that weren't part of the original 36, I would add We Were Soldiers and the the oft-ignored but successful Courage Under Fire.Include three great recent miniseries (Band of Brothers, Generation Kill, and the Pacific), save space for a few more movies that are a bit less universally praised (Platoon and Lone Survivor could fall in this group among several others), throw in some top down narratives (Patton, The Longest Day), and finally consider a couple great but limited release films like the tiny independent Fort Bliss and Taking Chance, the latter of which has received new life on Amazon Prime instant video.The math would suggest that even if this omits a few films and series, only 20 or perhaps 25 well reviewed and realistic military movies have been produced over the last 40-50 years.  I'd argue that this is a huge reason why American Sniper has been such a success, because it is a worthy addition to this list despite its numerous flaws in plot and character.What are those?  Some haven't been discussed much - at least one scene with the Marine Corps will likely irritate members of that service - but the ones that have been cited the most are that the Chris Kyle and the story he tells from the bestselling book are toned down, simplified, and cleaned up significantly.That brings up an an interesting point, as it's likely many of us wouldn't have much liked the real life Chief Kyle of the book and stories had we served with him.  Pretty much everyone who has been in invariably ran across his type at some point during their career.  They'd often described as just a bit too Hooah: cocky, a braggadocio, and someone who saw the world in black and white and could never be convinced that it might be otherwise - but who was also supremely talented in their skill set, and even if you couldn't stand their personality you'd respect them for it.The more complex Kyle isn't presented here, but part of the reason the movie works with even the stripped down version is that it brings home a truth of how the military has always been structured.  It wasn't that important to like or agree with someone and hang out with them or their teams.  What did matter is that you relied on them to do their job with the same competence that you did yours.  As long as you both respected that, the mission got done, and you could go home at the end of the day.  That was what mattered, and for most, always will.Beneath everything else here is that story of survival and its costs.  Much like the lead character, the plot doesn't explore subtleties, nor does the world it presents show up in shades of grey.  That part of the narrative ends up a fairly simple tale of us-versus-them, and in the hands of many directors and screenwriters could have been reduced to something awful like Red Dawn.Where Eastwood is to be commended is his enrichment of the story by bringing a complexity of a different sort to the film.  American Sniper presents viewers three critical aspects of military service which very few movies get right: that the generally accurate military culture in it is quite different than that in civilian life, that the effects of deployment in that culture means that life for spouses and dependents are dramatically affected in a way that most civilians aren't exposed to until they've seen a movie like this, and that the gap between the civilian and military world over the last three or four decades has grown tremendously and is extraordinarily concerning to anyone who has put on a uniform or lived with those who have.In other words, it succeeds in bringing up the big issues that service members deeply care about and that the rest of society outside of veterans doesn't usually want to discuss.  Despite its flaws, getting that part right during a very watchable film makes this at least a good movie, if not a great one.  As such, it's one that should be seen by as many Americans who want to begin to gain some understanding of the issues that concern every member of the military today, regardless of their political affiliation or their view on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.Finally, what's been lost here is there's some irony in the debate over whether or not this is high art and if it deserves Oscars.  In the end, where it ranks among the best films of the year isn't as relevant as that it qualifies as one of the most important.  That's why it's worth a watch or purchase.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANDU1I8HZR4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHVCFI#wasThisHelpful","RANDU1I8HZR4L","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bruce Hoffman's ""Anonymous Soldiers"" is an worthwhile analysis of the terror operations undertaken by Jewish partisans and the corresponding countermeasures by the British prior to their withdrawal in 1948.  In short, Hoffman concludes that terrorism worked to effectively undermine British control and effectively spread their targeted message well beyond the confines of Palestine.  The book bogs down as it gets into the minutiae of the 1944-1947 period, though, and and probably will turn off readers looking for a more general history on the region.  However, this will still likely serve as a reference for those looking to understand what was the most politically effective terror campaign in history and will be a staple on academic reading lists for some time to come.  4 stars.There's been a lot of history written on Israel's birth, but the British role in administering the Mandate has not received as much attention, partially because documentation of that side of the struggle was locked away for 50 years.  Having finally received access to the British archives, ""Anonymous Soldiers"" - the title comes from a partisan poem - recounts a more balanced view of the struggles than in the past.The first 150 pages tell the story of the Mandate from 1917 to 1944, and there are some startling revelations thanks to the newly uncovered British records.  Besides immigration quotas being unfilled in the early years before they were lowered in an attempt to appease the Arab population, a remarkable statistic is that between 1927 and 1929 Jewish emigration from Palestine actually exceeded immigration.  The story of the Arab revolts starting with the incident at the Western Wall in 1929 is well known, but the narrative would have been helped by some explanation of the history of just how the British ended up with the mess of the Mandate in the first place.  A more generally oriented book like Lawrence in Arabia is almost essential reading to understand how the situation evolved, and important topics like the initial attempts to partition Palestine by the British (not to mention the complex internecine politics of the era) are barely addressed.Once he gets to 1944, though, Hoffman slows down and spends the remaining 350 or pages of the book going through the intricate details of Jewish partisan operations - mainly Irgun, which generally targeted property and the smaller Lehi, which conducted assassinations, with the Haganah largely being left out of the narrative - and the inept British response.  Hoffman deconstructs many of the myths of the terror campaign, and one in particular, the bombing of the King David hotel by Irgun, is done in such a way that advocates for the traditional narrative will find themselves squirming.On the British side, what jumps out is just how underfunded and understaffed the police force and the military were for most of the Mandate until the very end when it did little good.  10% of the entire British army and 3% of the budget (a remarkable 1 solider for every 18 residents and 20 for every one of the estimated terrorists) proved remarkably ineffective by the time Britain finally attempted a more robust but ultimately futile response.  Just as interesting is the role of international pressure on the British, especially from Americans.  Most discussion of America and Israel starts in 1948 with Truman's decision to recognize the nascent state, but Hoffman provides some valuable context in the immense financial and political pressure brought to bear prior to that; among other things, examining the 1944-1947 period explains Marshall's position far more thoroughly than has been done by other historians.Despite the flaws, this will be the reference guide on the subject for years, and it's no coincidence that a copy of Begin's history of Irgun, The Revolt was found on the shelf of an Al-Qaeda training facility in Afghanistan in 2001.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KM3L2RZNHZW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594718#wasThisHelpful","R3KM3L2RZNHZW5","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Price's ""The Whites"" is an engaging, deep, and complex tale of seriously flawed characters careening from one tragedy to another in a New York far more reminiscent of the 1990s than today.  While it takes a while to figure out where the author is taking the main plot, it's offset by a marvelous job of slowly dribbling out the secrets that drive the characters.  The one weakness here is the mess of too many supporting characters driving subplots that ultimately do nothing for the conclusion, but this is still largely worthy of the buzz.  4 stars.After his previous novels and writing for The Wire, Richard Price doesn't really need to prove that he could write an intricate procedural, let alone under a sort-of-but-not pen name.  (In a recent interview, the author provided a more practical reason: he had contractual obligations to Farrar Straus under his real name.)  The blurbs for this book are from some of the top writers around, largely because Price has created many professional fans by showing he knows how to write deep characters and how they interact with the gritty world around them.That's what he does here.  The main plot takes a while to get going as he builds up one supporting character after another, but a good hint is the title.  ""Whites"" refers to the most egregious murder suspect a cop could never bust, and the members of the old Wild Geese anti-crime unit each have one.  Now disbanded with most members off the force, the unit's history (and the history of other characters) begin to encroach on their current lives.This is a bit of a hard book to characterize.  It's not a cop thriller, nor a psychological study, nor a tragedy.  It's probably best described as a book about how damaged people - some with badges, some without - deal with an imperfect world.  What makes the book a challenge at times is these aren't characters for whom you'll wholeheartedly root; they've all done some pretty sketchy things, and there's no moral compass besides survival and, for some, trying not to do worse than they already have.  One note is that thanks to the focus on past events, this feels much more like the gritty New York of the early 1990s than today.  Most of the characters from Girls would run screaming to Long Island or New Jersey after encountering a chapter or two of the world here, but drop in someone from Homicide and they'd feel right at home despite being a few hundred miles up the coast and 20 years out of date.The one drawback is that Price's love of secondary characters is at times a drag.  He can't be content to draw brief outlines, which slows pacing.  In one longer arc, this results in a subplot that really doesn't have much purpose besides stalling out things while the main plot meanders to catch up.  Better editing could have eliminated this and probably made this a 5 star read, but it's still a cut above most procedurals.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUCDJ3YPKGHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805093990#wasThisHelpful","R1OUCDJ3YPKGHK","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Linksys WRT1900AC Dual Band router is a high end router that lives up to much of the potential of the 802.11ac standard.  It's got great speed at very good range, which is the entire reason to purchase it.  It does miss on a few fronts - some of the options in the software are problematic - but it's really one of the first routers that shows what 802.11ac can do.  4 stars.For those unfamiliar with it, 802.11ac is a fairly new standard - keep in mind that you will likely have to buy a $50+ USB adapter for most pre-2014 devices - that offers substantially better range and somewhat better throughput in the 5 GHz range, where dual band routers really are worth the money.  The problem with previous generation 5 GHz routers is that they offer fantastic speed within 25-30 feet of the router and drop off massively the farther out you get.That's not the case with the WRT1900AC.  As expected, within 10 feet of the router this was good, topping 250 MB/s.  But a good 50' away from the router, through two walls, this did far better than expected, coming in over 100 MB/s, well ahead of the two other -ac routers I have tested.  There are some other neat features, like being able to name your own guest networks, but the best of them is that the USB 3.0 and combo ESATA/USB 2.0 adapters are genuinely fast - 65 MB/s write, 80 MB/s read - which means this actually is worth considering as an inexpensive NAS server with a couple of cheap hard drives attached.What's not as helpful is the firmware.  The biggest issue is that there are too few options for a high end device; you can't, for instance, play with the channel widths, which matter a lot if you're in an area that has a whole bunch of other routers.  More annoying is that you can't configure this for OpenVPN, and most aggravating of all is that the main workaround for dealing with locked down firmware - flashing this with OpenWRT - seems to be made rather difficult by Linksys.Still, it's a worthy high end router, if a bit expensive.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQLVRKBSNDL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEK4Q5Q#wasThisHelpful","R1FQLVRKBSNDL6","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HP 8 1401 is an 8"" budget tablet that shows the penny pinching with a feature set that's straight out of 2010.  At this price point, you're better off buying any number of other tablets that are more capable.  2 stars.Leave it to HP to enter the 8"" tablet market while other manufacturers - Lenovo for one - are exiting it because demand just isn't there, but the 1401 is HP's budget entry that isn't much of a bargain even compared to HP's other products.  The $10 more expensive 7"" HP S7-4200US has a better Tegra 3.0 processor, a 1280x800 screen, and a 5 MP rear camera versus the 1401's dated 2 MP.  At 8"", the $60 more expensive Slate 8 Pro has a very crisp 1600x1200 screen, a much better Tegra 4.0 processor, an 8 MP rear camera, and a battery that holds nearly a 50% higher charge.That's not to say this isn't somewhat capable.  In use, apps ran relatively well thanks to the quad core processor, although by using the older Jelly Bean instead of Kit Kat there was one that crashed repeatedly.  Battery life under light use was 8 hours, but with normal use ran only about 6, unsurprising with the smaller battery here.  The biggest drawback is the 1024x768 screen, which is relatively crisp but is just too low resolution for this size. The similarly sized IPad Mini has precisely double the resolution of this, and while bright and responsive, apps and video just don't look right when you're accustomed to more modern screens.Besides the HP products mentioned, the identically priced Asus MeMo Pad 7 has a 1280x800 screen and a faster Intel Atom processor, and for $50 more you can get the 8"" version.  If you don't mind hacking a bit and still being largely locked down, as of this writing the Kindle Fire 7"" is $20 cheaper but with a far more capable processor, much better 1280x800 screen, and significant content.  Finally, the refurbished 9"" Nook HD+ is now actually cheaper but has one of the best 1920x1080 screens on the market even almost 2 years after release.  Try all those instead of this model.2 stars.

"Hampton Sides' ""In the Kingdom of Ice"" tells three tales.  First is a portrait of the two men behind the journey, and the second is the confluence of both events and the Gilded Age that made such a folly not just possible but inevitable.  While worthwhile, Sides meanders a bit with those two, but moves from interesting to gripping when coming to the long-forgotten and disastrous journey by the Jeanette to find the mythical North Pole of legend.  The combination of all three stories is a solid read.  4 stars.The late 19th century and early 20th century's obsession with getting to the Poles is one of those cultural phenomenons that seems both archaic and even for the time, rather strange.  Most modern readers will know about it tangentially from the setup to Lansing's story of Shackleton, Endurance, but starting in the 1870s, there was a 40 year period where an astounding amount of treasure and lives were lost in pursuit of it.  More than anything else, ""In the Kingdom of the Ice"" details exactly how the beginnings of this folly started.The thinking behind why one needed to go to the Poles were outright bizarre, with some roots in mythology.  The Greeks proposed the eternal spring of Hyperborea, the Vikings a drainage pool called Ultima Thule, Jules Verne popularized the myth of a hollow earth with a warm vent in the Arctic in Journey to the Center of the Earth, and a number of psuedo- and real scientists somehow thought there might be a warm water sea at each Pole.With eight countries either proposing or running expeditions, the post-Civil War United States was ripe to join them, and the confluence of events that prompted this is the focus of two parts of the tale here.  The new technology and culture of the Gilded Age meant the United States had to make the trip or be left behind.  One driving force behind this was a young naval officer, George Washington De Long, looking to get back to the Arctic after an unsuccessful journey, make a name for himself in history, and almost as importantly, beat the Army before they could mount an expedition.  The second was the incredibly and eccentric wealthy New York Herald owner James Gordon, who both liked boats and simply wanted to sell more papers with stories either real or fabricated.  The third was the world's leading cartographer, August Petermann, who despite all evidence to the contrary from his armchair was convinced a trip to the North Pole would be not just worthwhile but easy - and in a variety of ways, more than anyone else contributed to the disaster.The result of all this was command by De Long of the USS Jeannette, a converted yacht that was well equipped for the disaster of the journey north.  The Jeanette ran into some simply astounding bad luck - had certain events transpired only a few weeks earlier, for instance, the crew would have been far better informed as to what they were about to run into - but to discuss the journey in detail would be to ruin the story here.  About the only reveal that isn't a spoiler is that a major naval award is named after a prominent crewmember, and that naming is well deserved.Suffice it to say, though, that Shackleton at least had an idea of what awaited him.  De Long and the rest of the crew of the Jeanette didn't until far too late on their voyage, and their journey marked the end of the Open Polar Sea myth.4 stars.  A worthwhile remembrance of a forgotten folly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHW2XCR2JPC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535376#wasThisHelpful","RYHW2XCR2JPC7","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Epson's VS330 isn't a bad projector for business use and is really aimed at  slideshow presentations.  It's lacking a couple of things that imply some cheapness in the manufacturing process, though, and there are both better resolution models that don't omit those features and ultraportable models from other manufacturers available at its price point.  3 stars.The ""VS"" denotes Epson's ""Value Series"", and there are definite design decisions here that reflect that.  The lack of 3D, some connectivity options and no carrying case aren't terrifically important but do imply some corners being cut.  What is more significant is the sound issues here, with a 1W speaker, a 37 db fan that sounds louder and can overwhelm the speaker, and the baffling lack of an audio output line.  All of these would have been extremely cheap to correct, and in practice almost entirely eliminates this for watching video except for short stints.Thus, this is basically a slideshow projector for business use, and it's fine for it.  The image quality is ok but not spectacular, with colors being bright but with a slight bit of tinting.  It's not awful by any means, but is more or less what you should expect from a lower cost projector.  2700 lumens does mean this will work in less than fully dark rooms, but the nominal rating of 25' from screen is a bit much; this is best used somewhere around 8-10'.While it's a decent enough business projector, the real issue is what else is available at this price point.  If you're looking for a portable business projector, the ViewSonic PJD5533W is a better value.  Video quality is roughly similar (not awful, not spectacular) but offers 1280x720 resolution versus the VS330's 1024x768, which tends to help perceived video quality significantly if your source is originally in 16:9 or 10 format versus 4:3.  The speaker is only slightly better (2W), but it does have an audio output, is a full pound lighter, and even includes 3D capability.If you're looking for a truly portable business projector, there have been a number of pricey ultraportables that have come out over the last year or two.  However, Infocus has just released two new LED projectors, the Infocus IN1142 and InFocus IN1146, that are priced almost identically to the VS line.  Like most LED projectors, they're significantly dimmer at 700 and 1000 lumens respectively.  However, at under 2 lbs, if you're traveling a lot they make a lot more sense than the VS330.All that said, this isn't a bad projector.  It's just that the competition has surpassed it, and while it's inexpensive the value isn't compelling at this point. 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3A6G7PSH6R0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMGDH38#wasThisHelpful","R3B3A6G7PSH6R0","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Zhivago Affair"" is an unusual book, combining a literary biography with elements of a political thriller.  Using extensive archival research, Washington Post national security editor Peter Finn and writer/translator Petra Couvee have produced what is best described as a robust biography of Doctor Zhivago author Boris Pasternak along with a vivid description of the intrigue unintentionally launched by the book.  While much of the buzz on the book focuses on new revelations on the CIA's involvement, the far meatier part is an examination of the intense pressure put on Pasternak by the Soviet government.  A star off for not following a couple of trails that would have made this a truly gripping book leave this at 4 stars.There had been rumors for years regarding whether or not the political storm raised by Doctor Zhivago had been fueled for political purposes.  In 1999, Petra Couvee received the first semi-official acknowledgment that there had been some tricks played, namely that the Dutch intelligence service had been involved in printing the book.  In 2007, Peter Finn wrote an article on the first major attempt to tie in the CIA to the book.  Ivan Tolstoy's ""The Laundered Novel"", a Russian language monograph, apparently claimed the CIA was behind the Nobel Prize campaign and speculated on a number of other Cold War contributions.  Becoming fascinated, Finn went to work on getting relevant material declassified and working his intelligence sources, and with an introduction to Couvee began the book.The result ends up really being more of a story about Pasternak and his incredible naivety than it is about the CIA.  Pasternak was one of the very few intellectuals that had been spared in Stalin's purges - Stalin apparently liked his poetry and told the KGB to lay off him as his ""head was in the clouds"" - and as a result, somehow didn't foresee any problem writing a book that could easily be taken as a direct challenge to the 1917 Revolution.  Unable to get the book published in the Soviet Union, Pasternak began trying to get it published in the West with varying success.Meanwhile, in 1956 the CIA had started a program (quite literally, a publishing house) to get Western books into the hands of Soviet citizens.  In 1957 a British MI6 officer purloined a copy of the manuscript, and a year later the CIA decided it wanted to publish the book for Russian consumption.  Having been warned against showing any sort of direct involvement, the Agency went through a series of elaborate maneuvers to publish a Russian edition for the 1958's World's Fair in Belgium.  After one disastrous attempt involving an American who tried to steal the book and print it in the United States for his own profit, with the help of the Dutch intelligence service the CIA eventually settled on an anti-communist Dutch group to publish around 1000 copies.The timing was propitious.  Without the CIA's involvement, Pasternak had won the Nobel Prize for literature.  The resulting storm is the focus of the rest of the book, where the full weight of the Soviet state fell on Pasternak for a book that almost none of them had read.  (Indeed, when Khrushchev eventually did so, he wondered why it had raised such a fuss.)  One of the great mysteries not really answered by the book is why Pasternak didn't pursue the opportunity he was given to leave Russia; had he done so, he would have been a very wealthy man and his family would have been away from the harassment that continued after his early death from cancer in 1960.All this is worth a read, but what's a bit unsatisfying about the book is that it doesn't pursue two of the most interesting aspects of the story: what else did the CIA do in the cultural Cold War if it published a million books in fifteen years, and what happened to the money?  Zhivago apparently made a number of people a fortune, but the author wasn't among them and about the only reference made to this is a brief comment about long standing litigation by the author's heirs.  Perhaps it is a dry tale full of lawyers, but one suspects that the untold story of how Zhivago's publishers got away with it might have been a compelling tale and certainly was worth a chapter to end the book.4 stars.  Not quite a Cold War thriller, but worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFVJG660F865/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908003#wasThisHelpful","R2QFVJG660F865","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cyador's Heirs"" consists of a young protagonist tale that L.E. Modesitt has told many times before in his Saga of Recluce.  It's neither original nor awful; mostly, it's like welcoming back an old friend who regales you with a good yarn for the umpteenth and perhaps once-too-many time. It's probably best enjoyed by those who already have a significant investment in the series.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for sentimentality.""Cyador's Heirs"" marks Modesitt's 17th entry in the Saga of Recluce.  It is his first since 2010's Arms-Commander and as the first of two planned volumes marks the first time since 2007's Natural Ordermage and 2008's Mage-Guard of Hamor that he has written extensively in this world.While Modesitt had largely exhausted the ""young ethical mage from a well placed family grows into his powers and becomes the most powerful wielder of magic and a competent military commander while crushing enemies foreign and domestic despite a peaceful outlook on life while paying a price for their actions"" template years back, what made the last three books palatable were their departures from this formula.  A mature feminist protagonist fighting a brutally patriarchal society provided a significant twist to Arms-Commander, and a less well birthed and strongly flawed hero attempting to overcome his mistakes and survive in a brutal environment made Natural Ordermage one of the top books in the series.Cyador's Heirs doesn't have that.  What it does have is a second-in-line to a throne who learns about his powers, gets some guidance from a tutor in magic and a tutor in military affairs, learns about politics, gets thrown into a big military conflict, and learns how to command troops and grow his powers without killing himself.The nominal twist here is minor: watching exiles from an advanced civilization try to cling on to some of the remaining remnants of it.  This makes for at least a few interesting moments, as thanks to previous entries in the series the reader will know more about that civilization than do the characters.  It's also been long enough since Modesitt has used the original template so that it's not as numbingly repetitive as it was when he wrote one of these every year, and it's not the worst of the series by any means.That said, Recluce fans will probably enjoy this rewrite of a story that Modesitt has told many times before, but the Imager series provides a more creative take on this motif than do most of the later Recluce books. Those not deeply invested in this series will likely enjoy the first few Imager books more.3.5 stars rounded up to 4, mostly because it's good to see more of the interesting world that Modesitt created 25 years ago even if his most recent entry is of middling quality.  It's nice to be back in Recluce, but given Modesitt has previously demonstrated he's capable of breathing new life into an old series, it's probably fair to have hoped for something more original here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7SI2WL65DSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJ04GU#wasThisHelpful","R2W7SI2WL65DSO","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Seagate Backup Plus series really is an improvement over Seagate's previous models, with the most helpful aspect being casing that ventilates a bit better.  The software is nothing special, but the drives have been reliable and fast.  4 stars.Having used previous Backup Plus models in 1, 2, and 3 TB sizing, the 4 TB version is more or less identical, with the internal drive being slightly faster - 145MB read/write on average, versus the mid to high 130s for the 3 TB model.  This also has a 64 MB cache, which on sustained transfers doesn't help but on smaller read/writes should.The major differences between this and the previous Backup Plus model is slightly better ventilation and a solid case rather than a removable and swappable interface.  This latter change isn't entirely welcome, since one of the nice benefits of the removable interface was to be able to hook up bare drives to a USB 3.0 port along with the option of hooking up a drive to a Firewire connector if required.As is the norm for Seagate, the software is nothing special; you're better off just backing up things wholesale.The only difference between the PC and Mac versions is the packaging and drive formatting; the PC comes in black, the Mac in grey.  Unsurprisingly, the Mac version sells at a premium that has nothing to do with the costs of the product ($10-15 as of this writing) so with even minimal computer knowledge you're better off spending 15 minutes of your time buying the cheaper model and reformatting.4 stars.

"The Presonus Eris E4.5 monitors are remarkable little speakers with great imaging and outstanding response for their size.

One example: the 4.5 is the only one of their monitors that has a 1/8"" jack for easy connection to a standalone MP3 player.Having used Magneplanar and Dahlquists, these are not quite in their imaging range but rather remarkable for a small set of computer speakers and far above what you'll find with other brands.  The 25 W goes a long way here.  Rated to 70 Hz, these are probably best paired with a subwoofer as they do have a low cut option below 80 or 100 Hz, and even a generic powered one helps; the PreSonus Temblor T10 is probably overkill.The only downside here is that these are good enough so that they will reveal source material limitations.  You're not going to want to listen to MP3s through them unless they're at least 320 kbps, and you will become very aware of the audio encoding on streaming material.  That's more a function of finally putting good speakers on a computer rather than a hit against the speakers themselves.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCSU6RO6IEEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ1VAMC#wasThisHelpful","R2OCSU6RO6IEEG","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Acer C720 is really one of the first fully functional Chromebooks, where it achieves about 90% of what users need out of a laptop.  With significant hardware upgrades over previous models, it's probably not going to be your primary PC, but it does a better job than its major competition - tablets - at a far superior price.  A star off for a bit of hardware lockdown leaves this at 4 stars.There's been a lot written about the Acer C720 and Chromebooks.  The best advice that doesn't seem to be commonplace but is common sense is that you can and should try Google's applications first via another platform.  If you can stand them, they will be your primary software on the Chromebook.  For instance, Google Drive's word processor and spreadsheet are very impressive for a free cloud based app, but those with more complicated work will soon recognize they're still a bit raw in places - especially if you're used to Word or Excel.  The biggest drawback is actually printing, as USB printing is basically a no-go on Chrome with virtually no drivers; you're stuck with cloud based printing instead.If you can get past this, then the Chromebook is priced competitively for what it offers: Haswell architecture for really nifty battery life (stated 8 hours, but I've seen it run up to 10), a 16 GB SSD for offline storage, and a 1366x768 screen that isn't spectacular - especially in the days of 1920x1080 tablets - but isn't mediocre either.  Best uses of this include streaming videos from the web to a TV (it handles 1080p quite well, and has an HDMI port) along with plenty of web browsing.  Battery life and lightness here - it's really not much heavier than a tablet at under 3 lbs - makes this more or less a perfect laptop to bring along to a coffee shop for light work or play.  Fortunately, Chrome does have VPN support built in for insecure Wifi connections, although it doesn't support SSL VPN.Being priced like a smartphone or locked down tablet like the Kindle or Nook, the true value here may be to hack this and install Linux - specifically the Crouton distribution - for far superior functionality, with easy dual boot capability.  A few caveats, though.  First, you'll probably want to upgrade the hardware as while Linux will run on a 16 GB drive and 2 GB RAM, you'll feel massively limited especially with storage.  Unfortunately, it's not that easy to get into the machine, and doing so will void your warranty.Second, even if you do get into the machine, the RAM is soldered in and can't be replaced.  Moreover, the SSD can be replaced but uses the new NGFF form factor, which means that it's smaller than even an mSATA card and largely unavailable.  The good news is that there is one NGFF SSD available on Amazon - the My Digital SSD - and people have had success putting it in the C720 and dual booting.  You can also add an external hard drive, but a mechanical drive will definitely limit your battery life.Just keep in mind, thought, that once you spend to upgrade this, you're looking at a $300+ laptop - in which case, you're probably better off buying a used laptop of your choice for more juice.  However, if you've got a 128 GB drive and Linux installed on the C720, it's quite functional.Hence, for $199 or even $299 with an upgraded SSD, not the worst deal in the world, especially compared to tablets around this price.  Basically, you're trading the screen of a tablet for significantly better hardware and a keyboard.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273URHTF63ZDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNPD1OY#wasThisHelpful","R273URHTF63ZDI","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack Cheevers' ""Act of War"" is an important entry in naval and intelligence history: a careful examination of the leadup to, capture of, and aftermath of the USS Pueblo incident in 1968.  A star off for a couple of aspects that could have used a bit more coverage leaves this at 4 stars, but still a highly recommended read.While it has been nearly forgotten now outside of North (and, to a lesser extent South) Korea, the seizure of the USS Pueblo was one of the more traumatic incidents in one of the worst years of American history, 1968.  Sailing in international waters, the Pueblo was captured by North Korea in a brazen violation of international law that essentially was an act of war.  The resulting imprisonment and torture of her crew was horrific; the intelligence loss devastating, and the blow to the projection of American power essentially equivalent to the effects of the similarly timed and far better remembered Tet offensive.Cheevers deserves significant praise for his reconstruction of the causes of the incident, beginning with the horribly planned mission and marginal equipment, continuing with the lack of promised support, and finishing with the ineptness of any coordination by the Navy with the Pueblo, including failing to tell the Pueblo of the (even more) forgotten and massively dangerous situation on the ground, where the North had sent in a hit squad to assassinate South Korea's president.Cheevers' detailing of the torture the crew of the Pueblo is difficult reading along with the American efforts (or lack thereof) to get the crew rescued, although in fairness, the North Koreans were not at all interested in releasing the crew until they got what they wanted, which was a perceived humiliation of the United States.  The followup to the crew's release is also interesting, with only a politically savvy Secretary of the Navy saving his service from further damage to itself after much of the utterly stupid command decisions were revealed while the brass attempted to put full blame on Commander Bucher.Why 4 stars rather than 5?  It's mostly because Cheevers gets close to writing the definitive account of the incident but misses on a few fronts, notwithstanding his attempt to get a North Korean commentary that wouldn't have provided much value.First, while his linking of the Tet offensive and the Pueblo is valuable, Cheevers essentially drops the Vietnam side of the equation in the American response; there is very little exploration of military recommendations and strengths at the time as it related to the chaotic situation in Vietnam.  Second, while it is eyeopening to see just how worried the United States was about South Korea looking for an excuse to go to war with the North in 1968, Cheevers doesn't seem to have incorporated much of the South Korean perspective.Finally, Cheevers could use a professional military perspective in his analysis, particularly when it comes to Bucher.  It is hard not to admire the man for his outstanding conduct as a POW, and in fairness, much, if not most, of criticism of Bucher seems wrong.  Bucher was handed a ship that really wasn't ready to undertake a mission that was disastrously planned, when he was attacked he couldn't have put up much of a fight, and his treatment by many of his fellow Naval officers and command following his release was rather awful.That said, though, Bucher made a number of serious command mistakes prior to the capture that Cheevers given his non-military background doesn't follow up on, most notably in not preparing for a worst case scenario of having to scuttle his ship.  Even with the Navy's negligence in preparing and supporting the Pueblo, Bucher could have likely mitigated the disastrous intelligence damage with a little preparation, creativity, and drills.  That perspective - along with an explanation of the career suicide Cheevers would have faced for refusing to get the Pueblo underway until it was prepared - would have been valuable, and it is very difficult to believe that there's not been at least some helpful professional military literature written on the subject.Still, this is an important book on something that hasn't received nearly enough attention. 4 stars, and worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R380PA1N6H1274/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451466195#wasThisHelpful","R380PA1N6H1274","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian Staveley's ""The Emperor's Blades"" is a solid debut fantasy.  It's action filled, has an interesting world, and enough plot twists to be worth a read.  It does seem to tick off every standard requirement to write a fantasy novel, though, and between that and a bit of uneven plot distribution one star off.  4 stars total, and it's promising enough that the inevitable sequels should improve as Staveley hones his craft.It's refreshing to have many newcomers in fantasy using George R. R. Martin's template for a world; people trying for power in a screwed up world makes far more interesting reading than princesses, knights, and wizards.  ""The Emperor's Blades"" follows that path, with a dead king, conspiracies galore, an ancient and modern danger, and three heirs discovering that the rich world in which they live in is not quite what they had anticipated.Other reviewers have focused on the plot and the characters; in summary, it's not bad.  The problem is that it feels a bit like Staveley had a list of boxes to check for Martinesque fantasy plot inclusion, which makes things a bit more formulaic.  Ancient evil?  Check.  Eastern-style monks who know about this evil and all sorts of lore?  Check.  Generic megalomaniac jerk characters as antagonists?  Check.  Brutal training that doesn't exactly fit well in the world's structure?  Check.  Ambiguous gender roles in a semi medieval world?  Check.  Likeable sidekicks?  Check.This isn't to say ""The Emperor's Blades"" is bad fantasy at all; it's just that it's less original than something like The Name of the Wind, which used most of the above checkboxes but in a much more creative fashion.  As far as plot, the only major weakness in the writing is the third point of view character, Princess Adele, who receives far less stage time than her brother - although despite her limited participation, she's still responsible for a major revelation that provides more to plot advancement than several hundred pages from her brothers.With more experience, there's promise that Staveley will up his game a bit in the inevitable sequels.  Worth a read, and 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZH2H1W81FRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCQQCX6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZH2H1W81FRP","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Con Coughlin's ""Churchill's First War"" brings a little covered area of the vastly mined life of Churchill to light: his brief sojourn in British India as a junior Army officer, and a nasty campaign in today's Afghanistan to introduce him to war being less glorious than he'd thought.  4 stars.Churchill has probably received more biography (including his own!) than any leader save Lincoln, and as such most of his life is well covered.  Coughlin takes an interesting approach, however, in focusing distinctly on his very first posting and engagement, which both Churchill and his biographers tend to skip.  Essentially, needing money to pay for his cavalry ambitions, Churchill began his writing career as a foreign war correspondent in Cuba.  Through mining an awful lot of family connections, he managed to be posted to British India.  Through more connections, ended up as a colorful war correspondent and volunteer junior officer dispatched to Malakand for what turned out to be a brutal six week campaign against the forebears of the Taliban.Given the short length of the posting, the focus is partially on a couple very specific battles - Churchill could have easily been killed - but mostly on the parallels of the problems Western forces have faced over the last decade in the exact same region.  Nothing much has changed there in over 100 years, and Coughlin makes a compelling point about the careless demarcation of Indian and Afghani territory slicing directly through tribal lines (largely for static defense purposes that were never needed) as a direct source of the conflict.As such, this is more a book about the region than it is about Churchill, but still worth a read.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM34SDBWGT9QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043042#wasThisHelpful","RM34SDBWGT9QS","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Ridley's ""The Heir Apparent"" is the definitive work on Edward VII.  Meticulously researched with vast access to primary materials that have never before seen the light of day, this does two things that every biographer wishes.  First, it redefines the subject and will likely serve as the stand alone book on him for decades to come, and second, it is academic writing that is equally gripping as a novel.  5 stars.Edward VII's place in British history is controversial.  He was certainly a product of the peak of the wanton Gilded Age: a womanizer who serially seduced other men's wives, a spendthrift who cared nothing about bankrupting his friends through his demands on them when he would visit (his hunting forays were simply extraordinary), and for the first 50 years of his life, someone who contributed very little to the world besides being at the peak of society as a playboy.  This view wasn't helped by his numerous political enemies following his death; his contributions were dramatically rewritten, and his playboy tendencies offset his reign.Ridley began the book aligned with the general consensus on ""Bertie"" as she calls him, but through lengthy and often incredibly difficult research - the work of finding letters back and forth between the various players in foreign, uncatalogued sources is jawdropping, along with decoding his appointment book - she reaches a different and compelling conclusion.  Edward wasn't much as a heir to the throne, but once on it, he was a surprisingly effective and popular monarch.Other reviewers have covered many of the topics raised by Ridley in the book, but there are a few that remain that are noteworthy.  First, Victoria comes across as simply insane: marrying a domineering man, venerating his memory as a saint, becoming involved with other men who surpassed Albert's model of abusiveness, and generally having what could be only called as a disastrous effect on the throne when she interfered with her ministers.  Second, Edward VII was the last British monarch to exercise real political power (of which he gave up plenty during his reign to ministers who often fought him tooth and nail), but the source of that power is fascinating given Ridley's portrait of Victoria.Bertie's power in foreign relations - the Entente Cordiale prime among them - came from continental Europe's misunderstanding of his power at home, where monarchs there actually did have real political power and where Bertie, in turn, simply acted like he did when he'd go overseas and then ministers at home would have to figure out how to merge his actions with their own goals.  Ultimately, Victoria's pet project of marrying off relations to improve foreign relations failed miserably, but the 10 years of Edward VII's reign were as close as she ever got.The only caveat is that it's recommended to read something like MacMillan's The War That Ended Peace to provide appropriate background to the complex world of European relations; given Ridley's focus on Edward, many of the other players make far more sense with a bit more detail.5 stars.

"Howard Blum's ""Dark Invasion"" brings to light a long lost series of attacks by Imperial Germany on the US during World War I, most notably a series of bombings and an anthrax poisoning.  A half star off for slightly breezy writing and another half star off for skipping a proper conclusion leaves this at 4 stars.While there's a plethora of books coming out to mark the 100th anniversary of World War I, ""Dark Invasion"" covers a niche that has largely been lost to history's dustbin: the covert operations of Germany against the United States prior to 1917.  Remarkably, despite having the largest spy network in the world, in 1914 Germany had all of one agent in the United States.  Through a crash course of recruiting, Germany's patched-together network proved remarkably able to create havoc well beyond their weight over the next two years.Blum's focus is on the men who conducted these operations along with Tom Tunney, the head of the NYPD bomb squad, whose agency was responsible for the vast majority of captures.  Of note are a Harvard professor who murdered his wife, escaped to find a new identity, and then bombed the US Capitol and nearly killed JP Morgan (whose financiering saved the Allies), a devilishly clever chemical cigar fire bomb that, thanks to non German allies, sunk innumerable transport ships, and a largely unknown anthrax attack designed to kill horses that appears to have killed quite a few people.  Tunney's work is remarkable, especially given the jurisdictional limitations that faced him through working for the NYPD versus the federal government; an interesting point is that Wilson was made well aware of the intelligence on the German spy network but that it did not appear to factor into his decisions.Three quibbles.  First, Blum uses on a breezy writing style that seems more appropriate for the movie to come.  Second, there is almost no original research here as Blum is reliant on the numerous literature about covert German activities that appeared at the end of World War I and were promptly forgotten.  (One of the greatest financial disasters in movie history at the time, for instance, was the 10 hour ""The Eagle's Eye"" which covers much of the material in Dark Invasion.)  Finally, and most frustrating of all, Blum concludes the book without a chapter on the fates of the various players here.Still, a decent read on the first terrorist attacks on the United States.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPZ5TX38I8Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006230755X#wasThisHelpful","R2DPZ5TX38I8Z1","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oral-B Precision 7000 is a great toothbrush.  Unfortunately, there is almost nothing to justify a $60 price differential between this and the previous generation Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 and current generation Triaction 5000 besides being priced 50% above those models.  3 stars.Oral-B makes very good toothbrushes, and it's worth getting one.  Unfortunately, their marketing leaves something to be desired; usually, you end up having some neater features on the higher end models.  That's not the case here.  About the only real advantage this may have over the lower end models is (supposedly) a slightly stronger battery.  The batteries on the Oral B brushes tend to really take a hit after a couple years of use, so how helpful this is remains to be seen.  (The travel case is certainly pretty and somewhat sturdy, but it's so bulky that it's hard to call it an advantage.)Unfortunately, Oral B has done this before, introducing the Triaction 5000 with a different brush and initially charging 25% more than the previous generation Precision 5000.  This is now priced at a 50% premium to the Triaction 5000 with essentially identical features, and the same open charger that tends to collect nasty crud.Unless you really want a black toothbrush in your bathroom as a fashion statement, this isn't worth the premium over the lower priced models.

"Margaret MacMillan's ""The War That Ended Peace"" is a worthwhile followup to her masterpiece Paris 1919, offering the same intricate reexamination of history.  In this case, however, the book is slightly less effective as it reads more densely; indeed, it could (and will probably) be used as required reading for upper level international relations courses.  Still, it's tremendously insightful, worth 4 stars, and will stand out as among the best of the 100th anniversary literature.In a sentence, one of MacMillan's conclusions is that Europe's La Belle Epoque was was not quite as good as it seemed.  There was peace, wealth, culture - but there was also tremendous nationalism, utterly incompetent governance, and without the work of a few able statesmen Europe would have flared into conflict long before 1914.  (One particularly interesting observation was of every French cadet being brought to see what hill they'd have to charge down once war was finally declared on Germany - starting the better part of 40 years before the Great War.)MacMillan takes a very in-depth look at the complicated pre-war relations between the great powers, and one other conclusion that's worth noting is her comment in the introduction that there were a long series of actions that slowly led to less and less choices for all involved.  Those actions are the meat of the 600 pages of the book, and at times it gets a bit dense and hard to keep track of the many players involved.  This isn't a popular history; it's a intricately detailed, dense analysis of the decisions and, at times, random bad luck that precipitated the war.  MacMillan lays much of the impetus of the war at the foot of bizarre foreign policy and naval buildup propagated by the Kaiser along with the economic backing of Russia that drew them into the French orbit (with France's own interests well ahead of Russia's), but there's certainly more than enough blame to go around.The other minor weakness of the book is MacMillan's occasional editorial comment on how countries then translate into countries today.  These tend to be very short blurbs, and don't fit with the rest of the massively researched analysis.  The author may in fact be right on her commentary, but a better fit would have been to dedicate a final, more detailed chapter to her conclusions.4 stars.  Very much worth a read, just not quite the masterpiece that Paris 1919 was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUGK522Z1IXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006855X#wasThisHelpful","RRUGK522Z1IXH","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Braun CoolTec razor is likely to be under the Christmas tree in many households that have a gadget-loving partner that needs to shave, as the CoolTec bar really is pretty neat.  Unfortunately, the bottom line is that it's not a particularly good razor.  3 stars.Basically, CoolTec throws in a bar - likely a Peltier cooler - that is supposed to make shaving with an electric razor less irritable to skin.  It does certainly provide a chill when shaving, and it's a neat innovation.  However, veterans of electric shaving are unlikely to notice much difference, and there have always been a few alcohol based pre-shave products which work just as well to make shaving more comfortable.The problem is that the CoolTec bar is wide enough so that the two blades on the razor turn into  essentially single blade models, and this presents a major problem when going over the chin, jawbone, and mustache areas.  The third blade, the long hair clipper, is especially ineffective; I'd find long hairs I'd missed a day later.It's a neat toy and may get those who've avoided shaving with electric razors into that camp, but there are far better razors at this price point.  3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEHS6C9JANWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFZJMFM#wasThisHelpful","RIEHS6C9JANWO","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE: As sometimes happens, Amazon and third party sellers seem to have combined several different products under one listing.  The product reviewed is part of the STBD1000x series and is 5400 rpm.  The newer Momentus XT is 7200 rpm.  See comments for details.Seagate's hybrid STBD1000400 drive is both priced and positioned rather oddly for the drive market.  It is about $40 more expensive than comparable 1 TB laptop drives, only slightly less expensive than far faster 256 GB SSD drives, and doesn't really have enough cache to really take advantage of its nominal hybrid functionality.  If you're really looking for a single hard drive for a laptop and are on a strict budget, this isn't a great choice, but it's not awful either.Intel hit upon the hybrid concept a couple years back for desktops with their Smart Response Technology, where you could combine a small SSD drive with a mechanical drive and reap the benefits of both size and speed for frequently accessed data.  (Back in those days, a small SSD made far more sense economically; even a 256 GB SSD was price prohibitive.)  With less space for drives, laptops are a bit different; you're frequently stuck with a single drive, and so it makes sense for a drive manufacturer to create a hybrid drive.Unfortunately, with 8 GB of SSD cache, this does one thing and only one thing well, which is to access and write smaller amounts of data - as in, starting up programs.  Realistically, you'd need somewhere between 32-64 GB of SSD capacity to really notice sustained transfer speed improvement along with fairly sophisticated disk management software to keep frequently accessed programs in the SSD cache.What's particularly strange about this drive is that SSD storage has gotten cheap yet Seagate has placed a $40 price premium on the drive over comparable 5400 rpm drives for what's probably $5-10 at most of cache memory.  The result is a relatively quick 5400 rpm drive, but one that doesn't make a ton of sense from a value perspective.  Most users would be better off buying a 256 GB drive (often found on sale for around $150) as a main drive and using an $80 USB 3.0 enabled 1 TB external drive for larger files like video.It's not that this is an awful drive; Crystal Mark shows 105 MB/s read and 115 MB/s write, which is quite good for a 5400 rpm drive.  It's just that the value proposition here doesn't make much sense, nor does the performance jump out at you either.3 stars.

"About the only real quibble with Scott Anderson's ""Lawrence in Arabia"" is that it is slightly mistitled.  Its subtitle of ""Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East"" more accurately reflects the book's focus, as it brilliantly describes exactly how the British - and to a lesser degree, the French, Germans, and Ottoman Empire - bungled the birth of nations in the Middle East to such a degree that their mistakes still haunt the world 90 years later.  Using primary source research, much of which seems to have been skipped by other authors, this account surpasses Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace as the single best reference on the subject and stands alongside MacMillan's Paris 1919 as a must read on how the modern world was created.  5 stars.Much of the story of the arrogance and blunders that created the modern Middle East is well known.  Sykes-Picot, the disaster of the negotiations at Versailles in 1919, and the British campaigns in Palestine and Iraq have all received substantial attention by scholars.  Anderson frames the conflict with a focus on 4 players that neatly represent their countries' interests.  T. E. Lawrence is well-known, of course, but the three other players are not: William Yale, a Standard Oil employee assigned to buy petroleum leases in Palestine who by 1918 ended up becoming the United States' ""expert"" on the region, Aaron Aaronsohn, a Jewish agronomist who founded an anti-Ottoman spy ring and viciously battled with Chaim Weizmann and other Zionists, and Curt Prüfer, a brilliant German spy who was among the first to see the potential of using Arab liberation as a weapon against current rulers and who, incredibly, recruited Weizmann's sister as his lover and one of his spies.  By interweaving their stories and other players like Sykes, French Colonel Edouard Bremond, Sharif Hussein and his sons, Dejmal Pasha, and the British military and intelligence establishment, Anderson constructs an extremely accessible history.At the center of this tale is Lawrence, and Anderson provides enough valuable insights on his character and actions to make this book be worth a read for that alone.  What is well-known about Lawrence is that his rise to prominence came almost as an accident and that his autobiography - which was originally intended as a very limited release for his friends - exaggerates much and muddles up more.  What is not is that Lawrence's leadership in the Arab revolt was quite personal and risky - Lawrence seemed to be outright seeking death on a number of occasions - yet arguably didn't have as much impact as his two great strategic observations.  Despite lacking any military training, Lawrence deduced the vulnerability of Alexandretta and the impact of isolating Ottoman troops in Medina long before anyone on the British staff did.  The second played a central role in British strategy, and if his advice on the first had been taken the Ottoman Empire might have collapsed as early as 1915 with the arrogant disaster of Gallipoli avoided.By the end of the book, Lawrence is more pitiful than heroic.  A five minute conversation between Lloyd George and Clemenceau at Versailles superseded 4 years of fighting and hundreds of thousands of deaths in the Middle East, and directly contributed to the mess that has existed there for the last 90 years.  Lawrence's observation on ibn-Saud and Wahabism proved remarkably prescient, and the rivalry between British Egypt and British India military and political staffs that helped create the mess is almost unbelievable.  About the only thing missing here is the postwar chaos and look at the Cairo Conference and the work in 1921 by Lawrence and Winston Churchill to provide a temporary fix to the mess made of the region, which Fromkin covers effectively.There's a lot more that can be said for the topics covered in this book, but the strongest recommendation is simply that even readers quite familiar with the region and history will learn something new here.  5 stars, and a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RT0FROMXMVW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553292X#wasThisHelpful","R1RT0FROMXMVW1","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper is a good, rechargeable hair clipper with a cleverly designed removable guard for different lengths.  4 stars.Most reviews of this product along with the manufacturer's description seem to miss that this is basically just a solid 1 1/2"" trimmer with a removable guard.  As such, it's perfectly fine for trimming sideburns or such with the guard off.  It's just about the right weight for a clipper - lighter clippers are a bit hard to go through thick hair - with the only real drawback being that as a rechargeable it's definitely not as powerful as comparable Oster or Wahl corded models.  If you're going to be doing a lot of hair cutting, it's worth spending the extra $20 or so for a plug in model.The one really neat feature of this is the removable guard.  It offers 8 settings of 3 mm increments between 3 mm and 24 mm with a single attachment, which is certainly unique.  It's a little disappointing that standard barber shop clipper blade guard sizes aren't marked off as well - there certainly is room for them on one side of the guard - but since they both vary by clipper brand and are measured in inches rather than millimeters it's understandable why Braun didn't do so.The lack of a charging stand and a travel case are the primary seasons why this is 4 stars rather than 5.  Something lightweight like this begs for being put in a travel bag as a slightly less powerful but still very effective clipper when you're on the road, but sadly Braun didn't include one.  Still, an effective rechargeable clipper.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNW0KC06HTEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI0N61K#wasThisHelpful","RSNW0KC06HTEP","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Berg's ""Wilson"" is a immensely readable and captivating biography of Woodrow Wilson.  Perhaps because of his access to two new archival sources - letters to Wilson's second daughter and the records of Admiral Grayson, Wilson's physician and close aide - ""Wilson"" does a superb job of revealing the man behind the many myths.  It falls a little short, though, when it comes to his administration.  4 stars.As Berg rightly points out, everything about Woodrow Wilson is arguable.  This is likely one reason why most modern biographers have generally skipped him as a subject; John Milton Cooper's Woodrow Wilson is the only recent attempt to try to interpret Wilson for the modern age, and that biography concentrates far more on Wilson's political achievements and failures than it does trying to illuminate the complexities of one of the most brilliant yet fallible men to ever occupy the Presidency.Berg's addition is welcome precisely because he shows Wilson's gifts and weaknesses.  Wilson has probably been subjected to more psychological assessment than any President besides Lincoln or Jefferson - Freud's tar and feathering of him in Psychological Analysis comes to mind, a book which Berg deftly discredits - but no one has really examined the details of Wilson's early life in the way that Berg does.  Berg's portrait is of a man who was equal parts brilliant and arrogant; Wilson was almost always the smartest person in the room but required continuous acknowledgment of his brilliance.Where Berg provides a unique biography is that Wilson's contributions outside the White House receive significant and detailed exploration in a way that few if any biographies have ever covered.  It's hard to overestimate the effect that Wilson had on undergraduate education as many of his reforms at Princeton were adopted by virtually every school in the country soon thereafter.  Berg does one better than most biographers, though, as he reveals just how much of the genesis of these reforms came from Wilson's total impatience with his own education, how he basically decided to invent his own course of study of political theory, and how he effectively became one of the first academics to publish or perish.While Berg does an admirable job exploring Wilson's administration and reveals some startling new insights - most noticeably, that Wilson likely was suffering from mental incapacity during part of his time at Versailles, and just how much the death of his first wife and courting of his second distracted him from the Presidency - the book falls slightly short here.  There are a couple reasons.  First, Berg doesn't incorporate much of the plentiful political analysis by other scholars about Wilson.  Wilson's great accomplishments as a Progressive were done with a largely friendly Congress, but Berg largely skips exactly how Wilson got much of his legislation through besides frequent visits to Capitol Hill and the President's Room, uplifting but not condescending oratory, and trading away the rights of African Americans in exchange for other legislative goals.  Bringing in some of the other scholarship here would have helped; there were a lot of political crosswinds blowing at the time, and Berg doesn't really mention them except in passing.Second, Berg's decision to provide extremely limited editorial commentary does the author a disservice.  Berg doesn't shy away from what he describes as Wilson's ""genteel racism"" but unlike a biographer like Jean Edward Smith doesn't call out his subject for his failings either.  There has been a lot written on Wilson's problems over the years, and Berg's exploration of Wilson's personality would have been a masterful way to incorporate them; a good summary of Berg's conclusions is that Wilson often took advice from no one but himself.  In doing so it made him perhaps both the best political theorist since Madison to occupy the White House - and also among the worst practical politicians to ever do so.Definitely worth a read, though, as it provides insight on one of the most consequential administrations in American history.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDCS979TUVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159215#wasThisHelpful","RUDCS979TUVP2","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Scotch tape is a very thin tape that is fairly adhesive but doesn't have a whole lot of tensile strength - it's akin to some of the really flimsy packing tape you'll find for $1 a roll.As such, it's not really something you should be using to tape up a box.  It's best used on top of an already existing seal, or as a replacement for a label that just says ""fragile.""

"The thinkThin bars are decent if not perfect protein bar meal substitutes.  There are definitely worse bars out there - some of the MetRX bars come to mind - and probably some that are better.  What's been really striking to me about other reviews, though, is that they don't acknowledge that different flavors may find different takers.For instance, I find the chunky peanut butter one of the best bars out there.  It's got enough texture so that it offsets the slight mush flavor of the large amount of protein found in any protein bar.  On the other hand, the creamy peanut butter bar doesn't have this, and is generally pretty nasty to eat.For a those not interested in a full serving of protein, the thinkThin snack bars like the Mixed Nuts are really quite good and deserve a try if you're looking for a quick and relatively healthy meal substitute.  Granted, a can of garbanzo beans has more fiber, more protein, and with a little seasoning more taste than any of these bars, but if you're in a rush, thinkThin bars are worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9KE45MHP0DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDINP4#wasThisHelpful","RX9KE45MHP0DJ","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Abaddon's Gate"" by the writing team of James S. A. Corey continues the Expanse series in page turning fashion with action galore.  The book isn't quite as sharp as the first two as the expansion on-the-fly of the series weighs a bit on the plot and structure.  Still, a fun summer read.  4 stars.It's hard to find good modern space opera - likely since most people who are capable of writing it probably end up doing screenplays instead as the payoff is far more lucrative - but Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck really brought a breath of fresh air to the genre with Leviathan Wakes and Caliban's War.  Their mix of modern characters, reasonable science along with the fiction, plentiful action, and multiple plot twists resulted in two very good books and the expansion by the publisher of what was supposed to be a trilogy into a six book saga.As ""Abbadon's Gate"" starts, all three major powers are at a standoff as to how to deal with the events of the cliffhanger ending of Caliban's War, where the original threat of the protomolecule has evolved into something larger - the gate of the book's title.  Meanwhile, James Holden is still haunted by another cliffhanger, who turns out to be not just non-corporeal but nonsensical, and is generally enjoying life.  However, the political events of the first two books inspire a conspiracy to jolt both the powers and Holden out of their complacency and deal with all the Gate represents, and the book takes off from there.It's hard to provide commentary on a page turner like this without ruining things, but there are a few points.  A bunch of major characters in the first two books don't appear in this one, and the vast majority of the action has the main protagonists of the Rocinante involved but off to the side.  Most of the newer characters are generally well written and their stories interesting, but a couple of the supporting cast arcs aren't as well done.  One major plot twist that sets up the last third of the book seems slightly forced as well, and overall the book doesn't feel as tight as the first two in the series.All this fits with the series being expanded on-the-fly by the publisher, where what was originally supposed to be a conclusion ends up being a middle book.  It's not badly done by any means and this is a still a fun read, but it just feels like the two authors bolted on a bunch of material onto what would have been the previous ending to the series in a way that would allow more books.Still, it's a great summer read, and the best news is that the new characters and expansion of the storyline here means that the sequels should be fun too.  Definitely should read the first two books before this, though.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R564QC69MUP19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2DZMYE#wasThisHelpful","R564QC69MUP19","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Energizer 180W Cup inverter is a useful little gadget for powering a whole bunch of electronic devices on the go.  It's important to be aware of its limitations, but 5 stars for the price and functionality.There have been a bunch of reviews about how this works day-to-day, but since no one has yet discussed the technical aspects of the inverter it's worthwhile reviewing them instead.First, while there's nothing in the documentation regarding how many amps this puts out, as this is rated 180W it presumably can supply up to 15A between the USB ports and the AC adapter.  That's an important number, as most cigarette lighter fuses aren't rated above 15A.  This means that this a. won't blow out your car fusebox and b. does have reasonable limits as to what devices can draw from it.  However, the AC outlet has enough juice to successfully run most electronics short of something like a laser printer.  This also includes a second adapter with direct-to-battery alligator clips if you're so inclined to bypass the cigarette lighter.Second, the 2.1A draw for the USB ports is shared between all four ports.  A 2.1A output on a single port will charge nearly anything quite quickly.  However, if you have 4 devices plugged in, you're going to be running at 525 mA per device, which is actually not awful and more or less what USB 2.0 is rated at - there are a bunch of nominal 'quick charger' adapters that provide this output.  (Keep in mind that some older devices may require trickle charging at 200 mA, which this can't do.)  Bottom line is that this will keep most modern devices at fairly stable charge levels while they're plugged in, but if you've drained the battery on 4 separate devices and plug them all in to recharge, it may take a while.Third, this is a modified sine wave inverter, which at this price point is expected.  (Pure sine inverters start at $200 and up.)  For almost everything you'll likely plug into this device modified sine wave power is ok; you can't use something like an alarm clock or a drill, and you definitely wouldn't want to plug in very sensitive electronic equipment or an expensive stereo.Finally, what's important to note about any DC-to-AC inverter with most 12V car batteries is that this is not something that you'll want to run with the engine off if you're going to use it for more than an hour or so.  A standard 12V car battery isn't designed to repeatedly discharge to low levels, and doing so will dramatically shorten its life.  If you really want to run an inverter off a 12V battery for extended periods of time, you're much better off replacing your lead acid battery with a deep cycle model that's designed to fully discharge.  Otherwise, this is best either used for brief periods of time or when your engine is running.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GY5UYTMJOQQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATXEPQI#wasThisHelpful","R3GY5UYTMJOQQI","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"L. E. Modesitt's ""Antiagon Fire"" is a solid entry in the prequel series of the Imager Portfolio.  Modesitt hews to his standard narrative of a superpowered protagonist who is struggling to be ethical, which means the plot unfolds in Modesitt's typical progression: lots of politics, some action, and some philosophy.  While this is a step up from the military march of Imager's Battalion, it falls slightly flat in an area that is usually one of Modesitt's strengths - forcing characters to confront the moral consequences of their decisions.  Still, a good read.  4 stars.""Antiagon Fire"" picks up immediately from the end of the previous book, and protagonist Quaeryt faces most of the same problems he did before; he has an army to lead but he's not overtly in command, he has people equal or senior to him looking to undermine him, and he's tasked with both diplomatic and military responsibilities.  In this case, those responsibilities are less clear cut than before; instead of being expected to defeat large armies through his growing powers, Quaeryt has a more subtle task, to complete Lord Bhayar's consolidation wars with less direct methods.  However, Quaeryt quickly discovers that he has a loophole to do more than he thought, and the book proceeds to follow his missions to finish the consolidation of the continent.Why is this a slightly weaker book than it should be?  A few reasons.  First, the loophole almost feels like an out for Modesitt to let his character not have to deal with the machinations that many of Modesitt's previous characters have faced when their preferred path gets blocked by bureaucratic enemies; Quaeryt largely has free reign over his actions without consequence (at least in this book; Rex Regis has the potential of being very interesting should Modesitt choose to follow up this thread.)  On a related note, Modesitt also continues to have problems with writing Quaeryt's superior Lord Bhayar; this may be the first competent boss Modesitt has ever come up with in his many books who isn't one of the main protagonists and doesn't die immediately.  Modesitt seems so used to writing scheming, incompetent leaders that presenting one that is merely self-interested presents some difficulty.Second, what's a bit more disappointing is that several of Quaeryt's actions bring up some serious questions regarding ethical leadership and politics, and for once Modesitt doesn't explore them deeply.  It's hard to explain this without providing spoilers, but one example is that Modesitt often negotiates around potentially controversial decisions by Quaeryt with the plot device of having Pharsi foresight guide his path.  Despite this, the Pharsi legends are still not fully explored; perhaps Modesitt will do so in the final book in the series.All this said, this isn't a bad book by any means, and it's better than ""Imager's Battalion.""  It's just that had Modesitt done his normal philosophical pondering, this would probably have been far more difficult to write but also have had the potential to be one of his better novels in a long time.  Perhaps that's nitpicking a bit as it's still worth a read.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZT4HQVDGZJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQMJX90#wasThisHelpful","R1WZT4HQVDGZJ2","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canon's P-208 document scanner is a nice piece of hardware for those who need to scan while on the road.  It includes duplex scanning, a TWAIN driver, and has a functional Automatic Document Feeder (ADF).  However, the bundled software doesn't use the full functionality of the scanner, and as such it's nowhere near to a desktop replacement.  A star off for this leaves it at 4 stars, but if you've already got the software or don't mind spending a bunch of money to buy some it's worth looking at.The last few years have seen the arrival of a plethora of travel-oriented scanners.  Wand scanners like the VuPoint Magic Wand are great if you're scanning books in a library but for document scanning are slow and tedious.  For USB-powered scanners, Fujitsu's ScanSnap 1100 is a fantastic ultraportable scanner at under 1 lb but lacks an ADF and is simplex only, HP's Scanjet 1000 is duplex but also is missing an ADF, and Brother's DS700D is duplex but also doesn't have an ADF and is quite a bit heavier at almost 3 lbs.  About the only two portable scanners that are true desktop replacements are the Scansnap 1300i and Canon's own P-215, but they're both also heavier at 3 and 2 lbs, respectively.Enter the P-208, which uses a single USB-to-mini B cable, has a size point that is small (1 1/2""x12 1/4""x2 1/4"") and light (1 1/4 lbs), has a unique but functional 10 page ADF that works for documents up to 8.5""x14"" and as small as a business card, color duplexes at around 8 ppm, and has a TWAIN driver so that you can use it with most scanning software and amend existing PDF files.  While the included case is mesh and doesn't really provide much protection, you can buy a more robust one, and if you buy the WU10 battery and wireless adapter, you can even use this with an Android device and skip the PC or Mac entirely.Canon has also done something unique in figuring out a way to make this almost completely plug-and-play.  By putting a ""Lite"" version of CaptureOn Touch onboard the scanner's internal memory, it can be run simply by plugging it into a USB port on most anything running Windows 7.  That version does a yeoman job scanning.What's the catch?  The rest of the bundled software.Unfortunately, the nominally more comprehensive full version of CaptureOn Touch included on the install CD doesn't take full advantage of the P-208's capabilities as it doesn't allow access to the TWAIN driver.  (Evernote and BizCard 6 OCR contact management software are also included, but they're not the main scanning programs.)  CaptureOn Touch saves in a variety of file formats, but none above 300x300 dpi despite the scanner being rated at up to 600x600 at 24 bit depth.  It allows only very minor editing of any captured images, not even allowing for skew correction - important if you use the ADF, which can easily do so if you've got more than a handful of pages - and is otherwise a generally mediocre program.  Finally, it ran into problems distinguishing dark text on dark background at 300 dpi, which meant that image wasn't even included in the capture.The good news is that because this has a TWAIN driver it can be used with more robust scanning software, and once you access device settings through the driver far more features become available.  The bad news is that you'll have to buy new software outright or use leftover software from another scanner to do so, and overall this still isn't a one-stop solution for a scanner.  You're far better off with something like the ScanSnap ix500 for routine use.For travel, though, this really hits a size and price point that's unique - it's actually smaller than a dedicated card scanner like the CardScan Executive with a whole lot more functionality, and might be an ideal scanner for the road.  It's easy to imagine scanning receipts, business cards, and miscellaneous documents on an airplane or hotel room with this; combine this with NeatReceipts and ABBYY Finereader and you've got a true portable scanner for the road.  The only problem is finding software that can take full advantage of the hardware here, and that's why this is 4 stars and not 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2W53JYUCNBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APEGA4G#wasThisHelpful","R2S2W53JYUCNBO","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Frigidaire FAD704DWD is a good, solid humidifier that restarts automatically when it loses power and allows a hose to be connected for continuous drainage.  By and large, it doesn't seem much different than its predecessor, the Frigidaire FAD704DUD, and in operation it seems essentially indistinguishable.  4 stars, as Frigidaire humidifiers are still basically hit and miss when it comes to reliability.Those who've purchased humidifiers tend to understand that humidifier reliability is often a random walk even for the nominally 'good' brands, and Frigidaire isn't any different.  I've had two good Frigidaires and a good Comfort Aire and two bad ones of both brands.By and large, the -DWD doesn't appear any different than the -DUD.  There are a couple minor differences in the specs, but the power consumption as measured by a Kill A Watt appears roughly the same, the case appears identical, the sensor reads the same humidity, and the noise level is indistinguishable.  About the only major design flaw with the -DUD that wasn't catastrophic (like the coils failing) but did plague some users was that the continuous drain port would often have problems directing water out.  According to customer service, about half the units required an adapter to function properly; to get one you simply had to call them and they'd send it for free.In limited usage, the continuous drain here works fine.  It's entirely possible that might be the difference between the two models.  Finally, for the record, you don't need a pump if this is placed within a foot or two of a drain, but do if there's any length of hose required.  If that's the case, the Little Giant VCMX-20ULST works well up to about 25 feet.4 stars.

"The Oral-B Triaction 5000 is a good, top-of-the-line toothbrush.  However, the many features that make it so are also largely unchanged from the previous top-of-the-line Oral-B Professional Precision 5000, save for a $20 price increase and a fancy new brush that many people won't use.  3 stars; it's a good brush but most people will find the older model to be a better value proposition.Oral-B makes very good toothbrushes, but their marketing leaves a bit to be desired; this is far from a breakthrough.  You'll get a very good cleaning from this one, but is it any better than what you'd have gotten from their previous top-of-the-line model?  Iffy.  The main differences between the two are that the newer model has a more clearly marked button to switch between the 5 cleaning modes, stops and chimes every thirty seconds instead of simply vibrating, has a green plastic backing instead of a blue one, has a green LED instead of an LCD to show battery charge, and uses the older version of the charging stand with a dimple in the middle instead of the newer ring one.  The last is probably not a good thing, as the older version was a gunk magnet and required near-constant cleaning.Other than that, they're pretty much identical: 40000 pulsations/minute, 8800 oscillations/minute, a sensor that presumably warns you if you're pressing too hard, nominal 10 day battery life (which is a little bit lower under field conditions, and there's a noticeable difference between a new battery and an older one for both life and strength of brushing) , and a wireless SmartGuide that you'll probably throw in a drawer and ignore.That leaves the new brush head, which twists and turns as well as rotating, as the only real difference between the two.  Of course, you can simply go out and buy a pack of the new brush heads and put them on the older model if you'd like; both use the exact same stem.  It's probably not advisable to do so, though, as most dentists recommend gentle bristles for electric toothbrushes and the new brush head definitely doesn't qualify.It's a good toothbrush, but it's not worth $20 more than the previous year's version unless for some reason you either really like the older base stand or have fallen in love with the new brush head.  If the price differential vanishes, I'll raise the rating as it's a very good toothbrush.  For now, though, 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYOKXDDSK1S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARTK95A#wasThisHelpful","R1PYOKXDDSK1S8","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Microsoft's Office Home & Business 2013 isn't a particularly noticeable upgrade over 2010 unless you're either a Windows 8 or cloud computing fan.  After a customer revolt, they fortunately fixed most of the draconian licensing issues that would have made this a complete fiasco.  4 stars; it's a good product with a few useful new features, although probably not worth an upgrade if you've already got 2010 unless your needs are very specific.There's not a lot to be said about Office that hasn't already been written; you either need it or you don't, and while they've come a long way, there are still going to be things that most of the cloud based solutions can't offer that various Office programs do.  Home and Student doesn't include Outlook (a big deal a decade ago, but for most not terribly important nowadays), Professional and Professional Plus include Publisher and Access, and all three versions include Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and OneNote.Unless you spend a substantial amount of time working on multiple devices at multiple locations, Office 2010's value proposition is better for most users compared to Office 365's $10 a month, which includes 20 GB extra of Skydrive space, some Skype time, and installation on up to 5 devices.  Initially, Microsoft made an utterly boneheaded attempt to differentiate Office 2013 and 365 by offering 2013 as a once-ever install for almost all versions, much as they did with some of the digital versions of Office 2010.  The customer revolt was meaningful and swift, as something as innocuous as upgrading your hard drive would have cost users the entire retail price.  Fortunately, Microsoft backed down and a reinstall is now permitted once every 90 days.As far as new features, the PDF editing in Word is a small plus.  It matches fonts nicely, is better than several other third party solutions, and is definitely superior to the freeware PDF editors currently available.  Unfortunately, it also requires conversion from and reconversion to PDF format, and in doing so for more complex PDFs it often will ruin formatting.  Given ABBYY Finereader's plugin currently crashes Office 2013, this is particularly annoying.  Outlook now syncs with web-based email far better than its predecessors, Powerpoint is a little more intuitive, and Excel seems largely unchanged for most power users.  The biggest change is that Microsoft is definitely pushing cloud based solutions; saving locally is a bit of a pain without having to go through hoops or changing defaults.  On the bright side, should you wish to use Dropbox or Google Drive, those apps integrate far easier with Office 2013 than with any other version.4 stars.  Microsoft nearly shot itself in the foot with the licensing policy here, the relative value of upgrading from 2010 is iffy, but overall Office 2013 is as solid as ever if you really need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUT3PGX216CML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPWJ98#wasThisHelpful","RUT3PGX216CML","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mitchell Zuckoff's ""Frozen In Time"" is a remarkable story of search and rescue gone wrong and survival in the one harshest environments on the planet during World War II.  It is also a story of negotiating government bureaucracy to put a fitting end to this saga.  While it's a compelling tale, there are a few weaknesses that should normally leave this at 4 stars, but it's worth rounding up to 5 given both the subject matter and the author's willingness to put himself on the line to try to write a proper conclusion.Greenland's geographical importance to the Allies during World War II for both weather prediction and as a waystation for transporting aircraft came at a significant human cost; the weather conditions there often made flying incredibly hazardous, and the glaciers and ice on Greenland made rescuing survivors even more so.  In late 1942, disaster hit as a plane went down, and every search-and-rescue (SAR) command's worst nightmare came to pass: not just one but two of the rescuers went down as well.""Frozen In Time"" tells the story of all three planes, the story of the survivors during the winter of 1942-1943, and the incredible effort the United States military - and especially the United States Coast Guard - made to get these people out and back.  The story here is one of the great survival tales of the Second World War and the eventual resolution of it reached the highest levels of the military and government and headlined national news.  Having been largely forgotten outside the Coast Guard aviation community it's well past time someone of Zuckoff's caliber brings it back to life.The second story here is the 2012 search put on for one of the planes, which is mostly about the persistence of a few people in and out of government fighting against bureaucracy, budgets, and impassivity to do the right thing, along with some semi-hairy times during the actual search.As a book, there are a few weaknesses.  The editorial decision to interweave the 2012 story with the 1942 one ruins much of the suspense and is largely unnecessary from a narrative standpoint; the stories could easily have been told chronologically.  There's a weak spot in the telling of the behind the scenes story of the amazing persistence of the 50+ sorties run by a single pilot on a single plane, but there's no examination of the logistics and support for it.  Finally, it's a bit disappointing there is no analysis of how a series of bad decisions abetted bad luck here; it would be very surprising if there's not been a decent amount written about the lessons the SAR community learned from this incident.All that said, considering Zuckoff put his credit card, house, and reputation on the line to get this book written, it's a bit unfair to give this the 4 stars that would otherwise be appropriate.  5 stars, and well worth a read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRO01CP1Y9Q0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062133438#wasThisHelpful","RRO01CP1Y9Q0Z","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raymond Feist's ""Magician's End"" wraps up the Riftwar saga with a surprisingly decent read.  It's not Feist's best book, but it's far from his worst.  4 stars.With the Riftwar series, the prolific Feist accomplished a feat that very few others have achieved: on average, he managed to crank out a sequel once a year for pretty much thirty years running.  As long time readers know - about the only people who might remotely consider buying ""Magician's End"" by now - the quality has varied dramatically.  Especially considering Feist expanded the framework on the fly to fit everything in, some entries were quite good.  Others weren't.The good news is that ""Magician's End"" ranks towards the upper end of the later books, even if it's nowhere close to the earlier books in the series.  That's largely because Feist figures out a way to bring back a bunch of series favorites in a way that isn't totally unreasonable.  The plot isn't anything to write home about - the B-story here isn't all that compelling, for instance, which is somewhat disappointing given the work he put in on some of the characters over the last few books - but Feist recovers by pulling back the curtains to reveal more of the secrets of the universe in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of A Darkness at Sethanon, and that along with the old friends coming back make this one of the better entries in a while.The standard disclaimers towards Feist apply, of course; if you don't like his books, this isn't going to change your mind.  However, as a presumed long-overdue series wrap-up - arguably, Feist might have left himself an out if he wants to write more in this realm - it works well enough.  4 stars, and not a bad way to go out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWOG1TPSYX3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061468436#wasThisHelpful","RFWOG1TPSYX3S","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Rubin's ""The Last of the Doughboys"" achieves something uncommon for a history book written by someone who doesn't specialize in the era: it truly transports readers back to the world of the Great War.  More impressively, it does so without requiring expertise in the relevant military history or sociology.  5 stars, as it is a remarkable book especially considering what Rubin had for source material.While there are a plethora of oral histories of American World War II veterans, the same cannot be said for their Great War counterparts.  This is particularly disappointing considering that other countries didn't follow America's disinterest; for instance, the Imperial War Museum has thousands of hours of interviews of World War I veterans, resulting in books like Forgotten Voices of the Great War and many of Peter Hart's books that break down various fronts of the war.Enter Richard Rubin, who in 2003 decided to see if he could track down the few living American survivors of World War I - all centenarians by then - and interview them about their service.  His method was ingenious; unable to find them through the Veterans Administration, he used the French government's awarding of Legion d'Honneurs to those few veterans still alive in 1998 guide him to the even fewer left 5 years later.  By what was often sheer force of will, Rubin conducted a noble, often quixotic effort to track down and interview the last survivors.The result is not precisely military history.  One reason for this is that the lives and lifestyles of anyone who has won the genetic lottery and become a centenarian is almost worthy of a book itself, and Rubin spends some time exploring those ramifications.  The other reason that isn't mentioned, though, is that there were no officers or NCOs left for him to interview because they were five or ten years older during the war and had passed away before he began his research.  Rubin's source material is thus entirely composed of junior enlisted types, and as such their experiences aren't necessarily central to the combat experience of the Great War.  With the exception of George Briant and Frank Buckles, most of the interviews he conducted provide only the beginnings of a story than anything else.Instead, Rubin wisely writes a book that is just as much about the America of the Great War period as it is about the experiences of the veterans in France and elsewhere.  Eugene V. Debs, Jim Crow, and the vagaries of the Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge administrations make appearances, and the wider focus lets readers unfamiliar with the social and political history of the time comprehend the America that embraced the Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1918.  Rubin then weaves in the wartime experiences of the veterans to introduce other firsthand accounts on the Great War, many lost in dusty obscurity since they achieved popular success 80 years ago and then subsequently vanished.  By tying together his interviews, the first hand accounts, and other literature, Rubin creates an accessible ground level history of the American experience on the ground in France.  Remarkably, Rubin incorporates not just well known battles like Belleau Wood, but tracks down the very last survivors of the AEF Siberia detachment and colored regiments.  This allows him to tell stories that readers simply weren't interested in back in the 1920s, and Rubin should be commended for bringing this to the forefront of the American experience.It's not a great oral history book, nor a great military history, nor a great social and political history of the 1910s and 1920s.  Readers wanting more depth and detail in each of these fields can find plentiful books on the subject elsewhere.  That doesn't detract from ""The Last of the Doughboys"" at all, though.  It combines all of the above and is a remarkable achievement in how it uses the final living threads of history to reconstruct a world long gone.5 stars, and very much worth a read for those at all interested in America's role in the conflict that shaped the modern world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R244H5W9V7LYCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547554435#wasThisHelpful","R244H5W9V7LYCF","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Nolan's ""Is China Buying The World?"" is a useful collection of facts and assertions that point out that much of the fear of Chinese business dominance is overdone.  A star off for his almost-near omission of some of the most salient points of the discussion of Chinese domestic and international markets, however, makes this brief book a little less convincing than it should be, and a half-star off for producing what at times feels like a data dump leaves this 3.5 stars rounded down to 3.Nolan, a professor of Chinese development at Cambridge, has been a one of the more insightful and productive academic writers on the complicated relationship between China and the West.  His basic argument here isn't particularly complex and should be familiar to anyone generally aware of the Chinese market.  For reasons of history and government, China has lagged badly in international development since the days prior to Western interference, when it possessed 33% of world industrial capacity versus 18% in the West.  Much of the resulting attempts at growth over the last decade are an attempt to catch up on a per capita basis; China remains brutally poor in many areas (although he does not discuss the particularly dramatic rural-urban split), lags in R&D, lags in overseas opportunities, lags in strategic resources, has massive foreign reserves partially because of the dramatic Asian crisis in 1997-1998, and overall has accepted far more foreign direct investment than it has returned.Many of these are fair points, and this is a somewhat effective response to many of the Chinese-taking-over-the-world arguments which are made for local political consumption.However, where the book falls short is in what he leaves out.  The biggest omission is on foreign investment in China, where he paints a much rosier picture of the climate than what most Western executives report.  China has certainly welcomed foreign investment, but extracts a price that no other country on the planet requires: not only Chinese majority ownership of forced joint ventures, but also technology transfer to Chinese companies as a basis to be allowed to sell to the Chinese domestic market.  It is true that Western firms have a massive R&D advantage on China, but the lack of respect for intellectual property has narrowed this gap tremendously.  Furthermore, there isn't a discussion of Chinese fiscal policy, which while it has received some unfair political pandering does possess some genuinely disturbing tendencies and also creates issues for companies selling to the Chinese internal market.The book also suffers from what can best be described a tendency towards data dumping of largely irrelevant factoids.  Some of this comes from the source material of the book being an expansion of a white paper Nolan gave to the US-China Business Council in 2011, with a target audience likely expecting reams of data whether or not it's relevant to the overall thesis.  However, the value of including such tidbits of information like ""In 2003-2004 GE engines powered more than 80% of coalition aircraft during Operation Iraqi Freedom"" is dubious and often gives the impression that Nolan is looking to outright overwhelm readers with data instead of convince them with arguments.Still, it's a useful primer for those who aren't that familiar with Chinese development over the last few decades.  3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FDXCEXNSJR2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745660789#wasThisHelpful","R2FDXCEXNSJR2B","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main point of Donna Freitas' ""The End of Sex"" is entirely reasonable: that the hookup culture on some campuses isn't particularly healthy for college students.  In the process of trying to support this, though, Freitas runs into some major problems, butchering the methodology of her survey and providing an overall analysis that is both flawed and and impractical.  2 stars, as credit needs to be given to the author for at least doing some serious thinking and passionate writing about this phenomenon.Freitas' conclusion about the hookup culture - that it ""silences, shames, isolates, and disempowers students, quashing their ethics, desires, and differences, their need for respect and connection, and their need to be treated with bodily dignity, to express emotion, and the experience of pleasure"" - is going to alienate some readers even before they crack open her book.  Even if readers don't agree, though, there is an objective argument to be made about the consequences for this generation once they begin attempting to settle down and form long term relationships without the benefit of learning from the dating mistakes everyone makes in their teens and twenties.  Not surprisingly, the most compelling portion of the book comes when Freitas discusses Kerry Cronin's work on the challenges and benefits of actually getting students to try dating rather than hooking up, since Ms. Cronin is one of the few people who've taken practical steps to address this gap.Unfortunately, that is one of the few highlights.First, the methodology for many of her arguments is simply atrocious.  ""The End of Sex"" is largely composed of a quantitative analysis of the data set of Freitas' earlier book, Sex and the Soul, which received high praise from someone as distinguished as Harvey Mansfield for her qualitative approach as a ""welcome change from the neutral questions and narrow statistics"" of quantitative social science.  While the in-depth interviews in ""Sex and the Soul"" certainly provided some interesting insights, Freitas - a professor of religion who is familiar with the classics but not qualitative methods - outsourced the data analysis after she completed her survey.  Unfortunately, her decision to not seek the same assistance in setting up the survey proves fatal here.While Freitas has gathered a sample of 2500 students in 7 undergraduate settings to discuss their habits, many of the answers received from this data set don't correspond to other research that's available, probably because there are some fairly obvious holes in how she collected and sorted the data.  Among them is her bewildering decision to frequently categorize her results by the respondents' choice of college; about the only meaningful correlation suggested by this is the unsurprising revelation that evangelical college students have somewhat different values than their peers elsewhere.In addition, much of her application of this data is equally questionable.  One of the more eye-popping arguments she tries to form is that since 75% of her respondents disagreed with the question ""sex is primarily the taking of pleasure from another person"" it follows that that the same 75% therefore disagree with ""the notion of hookup sex as a purely physical experience.""  A full dissection of the problems here would take several pages, but suffice it to say that Freitas is on far more solid ground reviewing philosophy than reviewing data.A major concern in both books is that Freitas is largely silent on what might be a happy medium for young adults between the extremes of abstinence projects like Anscombe at Princeton (which she admires save for their problems with LGBT students) and the hookup raunch she condemns.  The role of and health of sex as a part of a committed relationship is entirely omitted besides a suggestion that ""(for) committed student couples...press(ing) pause on (their) sex life can be empowering.""  It's possible this might work for a small group of students, but overall this is not substantially more helpful than her belief that reading Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, St. Augustine's Confessions, and Plato's Symposium can serve a significant role in helping students not succumb to the temptation of hookups.  Freitas is probably on to something when she suggests that colleges should consider spending resources to help students think about dating and relationships, and there is certainly a valued place within academia for the use of classics to help students grow into ethical and moral adulthood.  However, it's not clear that her reading list would discourage hookup culture outside of the occasional philosophy department.Finally, despite including panel discussions with with sociologist Mark Regnerus and incorporating his earlier comments on the same subject, it is particularly odd that Freitas does not address his more recent work on premarital sex among young adults.  Consistent with other sociologists who have done work on this area, Regnerus' analysis suggests that the prevalence of the hookup culture is exaggerated, that it occurs far more at elite universities than the vast majority of other colleges, and that college student behavior in aggregate shows a lot more diversity than is claimed by media reports.  Ironically, during her lecture tour for ""Sex and the Soul"" Freitas admitted that in interviewing students on a larger campus she found them participating in more traditional relationships and believed that the size of campuses might make a difference, but unfortunately that observation doesn't make it into this book.2 stars; Freitas' heart is in the right place and she's done a lot of thinking, but this isn't an effective book.  For a more balanced and statistically robust look at this issue, try Regnerus and Uecker's Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think about Marrying instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SXOAHZ144PRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465002153#wasThisHelpful","R2SXOAHZ144PRR","A3R56AWX8PRQLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R56AWX8PRQLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The PS4, PS3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One controllers are many times better than this. Also, this is very expensive considering how lightweight and cheaply made it is.

"Alright, the original Sphero isn't much fun and this is no different. BB-8 does not make any sounds, everything comes from your phone which is very silly. This is controlled by an app which is not very accurate and the droid/head will sometimes make wild turns due to the way the mechanism works. The ball is, of course, plastic and roughly the size of a tennis/baseball. It's unfortunate they didn't make it a bit bigger but I guess they just wanted to be able to just Skin a Sphero instead of making a completely new product.Some people are saying it's amazing just because it's Star Wars and while that does make it cool, it doesn't make it cool enough to be worth the money. Odds are that after a few times of playing with it you will rarely use it again and just keep it on your desk since it looks sweet. If you're thinking of getting it... I say skip it. You will see many blogs and media personalities saying this product is awesome and worth it but lots of them were sent the product and did not pay the $150 that you might. This doesn't mean people don't really like it, I am just saying that you should not let your decision be guided by the media.I find a replica saber that I got for under $150 to be much cooler and more worth the money for a Star Wars fan. Just wait for a nice model BB-8 you can put on a desk or something that has more functionality than this, or until BedBathBeyond and others allow customers to use coupons on this item.

Make sure you don't pay more than the actual retail price which is $30 so I recommend waiting for it to be back in stock or just getting it from Lego or elsewhere.

I recommend putting a little bit of mounting putty under the stand to prevent it from slipping, this goes for nearly all Apple Watch stands out there too.

"This is a collection of three short stories, each of which contains one fanciful premise, none of which I can disclose without spoiling. The set-ups for the stories are very good, and the reader gets easily drawn into them. Further, they are short, and it does not take very long to get through them. For me, there was a problem in that while the start was very good, the endings appeared premature, and for me there was no bite at the end. Thus there were descriptions of something unexpected happening, if not impossible, but at the end all I was left with was a description of the event. The third one was even stranger, because it was a short story within a short story. ""I"" sat down on a park bench, met strangers, and told the story that really needed more at the end, while the outer story had no ending at all that was, in my view, worth including. In short, for me the stories were to some extent unfinished. One could assume the author intends the reader to see things at a greater depth, but in my opinion, if so such interpretations could go almost anywhere. To achieve that, there has to be a firmer foundation on which to build the interpretation. Good starts, interesting premises, but for me, an empty feeling at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R253UKMHEEOWZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VETGVAE#wasThisHelpful","R253UKMHEEOWZM","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Soaring is a spiritual book that aims to show people how to reach their maximum potential. It is clearly written, and any reader should have little difficulty in understanding the messages. Therefore the utility of the book depends on whether it works. Does it help? The book has a deeply religious undertow, so the answer to that depends in part on whether you are religious. If so, the steps like ""pray"" will probably help significantly. If you are not religious, there is still plenty there that may well help, but this may have to be teased out. Also, I am not quite sure that all the advice will help.  One of the chapters suggests the person visualize/dream of the end success. From experience of having watched others, this is bad advice. Rather than focusing on what success will be like, it is much better to focus on the means to reach that end. (In fairness, the author does mention that later, but the e4xample of taking very little from a house threatened with fire on the basis that with a positive attitude the house will not burn is not good advice.) The book also gives frequent lists of things to do, and I an reasonably confident this will help some people. The religious overtones will probably not be acceptable to some.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LKC2DMVZUB4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0YUD3G#wasThisHelpful","R2LKC2DMVZUB4F","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is in the horror genre, and is set in Queensboro, a small town (I think) in one of the Carolinas. There are a large number of characters, and these are quite well depicted. Additionally, the atmosphere of the place is described outstandingly. The reader should be readily able to picture the place, and the people in it. (Whether it a fair representation of people in that part of the world is another matter, though.) If you are looking for writing that shows characterization and setting, you cannot go past this, and it would be five + stars.For me, however, there were basic flaws that annoyed me. The first was grossly excessive backstory that was irrelevant to the story, except to further portray the characters in situations quite different from what they were facing in the story. Yes, that helps describe what sort of people they were, but for me, the author won this battle maybe fifty times, at the expense of the war. Worse, all this good work with the characters became undone when the horror arrived. Suppose you saw someone, and it appeared there were worms or something working their way underneath the person's skin, what would you do? Generally speaking, these characters do nothing. They are not horrified, so neither was I. Which gets me to my main gripe: for a book to portray horror, apart from the horrible agent, the rest has to be credible. A larger worm with wings picks up a person and flies off. From the description, this is aerodynamically impossible (It would have to be shaped more like a Pterodactyl) but OK, we can leave this aside. So what do the locals do? They charge off to the forest, where they all get attacked and killed by said worm or worms. This is told more or less like that; it is statistics, not horror. Additionally, why were they not armed? Or if they were, why did they not use said arms? Even a machete or a knife would help. But no, they apparently stood there and got sucked dry. There were a number of scenes where I did not really understand the outcome. There was an obvious one, but something else should have happened. Either I am not ""with it"" or the writing was confused; I know what I think. Then there was another problem. There is an action scene, we get near a climax, and . . . oops no backstory for a few pages so yes, let's have some more. For me, suspense is not achieved by simply stopping and introducing filler. The actual relevant story is rather short, and in my opinion, very excessively padded. I also found the action scenes to be rather poorly written because again the behavior of the characters lacked credibility. There are also a lot of references to a drug, but what does it do? How is it relevant? The worms attack people, just once. Why stop? Where are they now? Too many irrelevancies for me, and too many questions unanswered. I was just not horrified, or even concerned, but merely puzzled.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBRL0LVBN6B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692411275#wasThisHelpful","R3MBRL0LVBN6B4","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is a biography of Marcus Porcius Cato, a stoic, and as described on the cover, ""mortal enemy of Caesar"". However, it is also an account of the death of the Roman Republic, it shows why it died, and it paints Cato as the last citizen to try and prevent its death. It was also an exercise in futility. Cato stood for ""what was right"" at a time when corruption, bribery and the use of brute force prevailed. In principle, the law provided justice, but in practice, trials could be bought. Getting something done in the political atmosphere of Rome required a lot of support. Cato was essentially isolated because he felt virtue itself would bring all to his point of view, and when it obviously did not, he felt that he had at least tried. The book brilliantly portrays a man whose stubbornness means he must refuse to compromise, and his refusal to compromise inevitably meant that he achieved very little. Additionally, he was somewhat less than pure when it came to his own family. The book also shows how Cato's refusal to play politics led to admiration from those who were unimportant, and the inability to save Rome. The book almost ends with a quote from Lucan: the lost cause was dear to Cato. If you want to know about the end of the real Res Publica, but do not want full academic depth, the research behind this book makes it extremely desirable reading.I cannot judge the accuracy of the work, and nor, I suspect, can anyone else. The ancient sources are notorious for reflecting more the character of the author than of the subject, and in some ways, Cato the person is difficult to find in this account. Personally, I prefer this because basically we don't know, and I would rather the person be a somewhat ghostly person than a fabricated one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFS97E8VQPVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085UD4A0#wasThisHelpful","R2KFS97E8VQPVN","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
". . .  in which ""I"" reviews his life (or doesn't, depending on your view), seeks the meaning of life (although not with excessive effort) and eventually concludes (maybe) that it is all summed up in a Mick Jagger song line. Not that the line has deep meaning. Maybe it has no meaning. Who knows? For that matter, who cares? The book is a mind-hopping ramble involving a stream of consciousness (assuming he is conscious) in which every thought is thrashed to death without getting anywhere in particular. However, it is done with a certain flair and charm. The events in his life that we know about are he was born, he did a milk run as a child, his parents died (It happens, sooner or later, but we do not know whether it was sooner or alter) he had a school interview, he went to University, he took LSD (not that we find out what he saw), and he thought about life, well, sort of. Few details are given. For the school interview, he sees a door that is shut, he knocks, it is opened. That is all, and it takes a chapter to tell that. Did I say it was a ramble? Maybe I did. Can I do his style? Nowhere nearly as well, it seems. Well, maybe a little.I have never seen a book quite like this before. If you are looking for plot, or deep philosophy, or even interesting descriptions, you won't get them, and this would rate as one star. If you want an inconsequential verbal ramble with charm and some inner psychological thoughts to contemplate, this is about as good as it gets, and would warrant five stars. I have averaged these extremes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163BAUK4GWNMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2C9VLS#wasThisHelpful","R163BAUK4GWNMU","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those books that does not fit easily in any genre. The time is sometime in the future (I think) when humanity has been spread through at least part of the galaxy. There is a major alien race called Xenons, there is a Hell-planet that once was Earth, and humanity is ruled by King Talus and at least at the start, five children, the youngest of which, 12 year old Prince Victor, is on the planet Pax, which is the intellectual centre. However, it turns out that the children, who each sub-rule a sector, are squabbling, and Ramsey kills Jason and acquires his territory. Victor is taken from Pax, nominally by people who oppose Ramsey, but eventually they are under siege. Victor descends in an escape pod to Earth (Hell), acquires some supernatural powers, and also takes on the name Lucifer, which apparently means, the bringer of light. The rest of the story involves the attempts to right the wrongs, good versus evil, etc, with Lucifer on the side of good. As an added bonus, there are quotes from Machiavelli at the start of every chapter.On the technical side, the writing is good, and it is easy to read. Unfortunately, for me there were structural flaws. The first one is logic. Twelve-year old Victor is put in an unguided unpowered escape pod and sent to Hell, where he is asked to stay alive for a day or so, dressed only in his pyjamas. Some others will go to some escape vehicle, join another ship, then they will go down to Hell and rescue Victor. This beggars belief as a plausible plan. Why don't they take him with them? If they do not make it, he will not either because he cannot survive on his own (or so they believe), there is no reason to believe he will survive an unpowered crash, and the crash could be anywhere. Then there is the supernatural power. It is used once to devastating effect, except that the incident has no impact on the overall story, and later, when it would be useful, it is ignored. The story is starting to become interesting, but if you start wondering where it is going, we are suddenly introduced to four soldiers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which, coupled with a Michael and a Gabriel, makes the second half essentially obvious. Ramsey destroys Pax, but why? Generally, reasons for things happening are hard to find. Finally, the most exciting part, at the end, is largely told, not shown, and the telling seems to remove much of the excitement. There is also an inconsistency at the end. The Xenons might be aptly named, though. Xenon is an inert gas, and these Xenons are not shown to be doing anything much. To summarize, this could have been a great book, and if these flaws do not put you off, then go read it, for it is certainly different from a lot of others. For me, the flaws I pointed out above are a fine example of an opportunity missed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3URR02KUNFU2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZHCOMC#wasThisHelpful","R3URR02KUNFU2M","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is part two of a trilogy, and from experience, this tends to be the more difficult to get right. In this case, I think Wilson has done a very good job, and I think this book could be read stand-alone without any significant problem. The required background to the story is that the Epherium Corporation has colonized three nearby planets, and the Earth Defence has built a huge warship, the Armstrong to go out to defend the colonists at Cygni. It was after the colonists set out that Earth was attacked by an alien race, the Cilik'ti, which is why the Armstrong  was sent out. On the way, it was harassed by some unknown stealth ship, which is presumed to be from some Earth organization, but it is unclear exactly where it came from. The book opens with the Armstrong arriving at Cygni, the crew meet the settlers, and we get the results of the initial colonization. It turns out that at least some of the settlers are re-programmed criminals, so there are three potential hazards.With a couple of reservations, the story is very well written. It is painfully obvious that the story is going to involve at least one of three problems, but the quality of the writing is such that what actually happens is something of a surprise, which limits my ability to comment on the bulk of the story without spoiling. My two reservations are first, in the main event, there is an attempt to generate tension through an equipment failure that is essentially a design fault. I think that was unnecessary because it had the opposite to the intended effect on me. There was plenty of tension, and you do not send a major expedition out with a serious design fault in a major piece of equipment that could be reasonably remedied. The second problem for me was there is a short action sequence at the end, but the situation the protagonists find themselves in is, in my opinion, unreasonable, and worse, the scene was, in my opinion, unnecessarily ""blow by blow"". I refuse to spoil, but since this story is well worth getting, I mention this as an exercise in analysis. If you don't get it, you will enjoy the book even more. Without those flaws, and a slightly confusing ""major scene sequence"", I would give it five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TA6XETRJ1DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I66AA00#wasThisHelpful","R4TA6XETRJ1DV","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a thriller that starts with Mark Bolton winning a bet in which he gets the use of his boss's car, and just as he is about to start his first ride, he becomes the victim of a phosphorus bomb. The scenes switch around a bit, and we soon get introduced to Dr Augustus Bolderjack, who is a sort of free-wheeling psychologist come profiler, and who has been used by the FBI. He ends up working for yet another part of the US government as the problem descends into a form of biological terrorism. I can't say much more about the plot without spoiling, other than to say it moves at a ferocious speed through various parts of the western US, and involves a detailed description of a Mormon cult group.I have no idea whether the comments on Mormonism are valid, but for worry worts, the biological agent is impossible. For those interested, here is a chance to test your scientific knowledge! The writing moves well from about a third of the way through, although I confess that I found the opening could do with some editing, particularly with regard to lurching into different material in the middle of a paragraph, a style which I found a little confusing. However the writing quickly improves, or maybe I got more used to it. The language is also a little raw in places. Overall, fast-moving, which is just what an action thriller should be, and the action is not contrived, although it is not exactly flattering to the US government, not to some of the police forces there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TOL45Q1GYWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1JB79K#wasThisHelpful","R33TOL45Q1GYWK","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an apocalypse ""wipe out civilization"" type of book, the villain here being Yersinia pestis, and a rather unusually infectious form that gives pneumonic plague, and also one that does not respond to antibiotics. The first chapter involves an outline of the nature of the disease, and the author has done some serous factual research. The rest of the book has two basic parts. In the first, it describes how the plague gets started, with the sort of transmissions used by the pestilence. Before long, it has managed to get world-wide in parts, but at a very low level, and it is recognized. The story then follows some ""preppers"" who seem to be prepared for any sort of disaster and they journey through quite a distance of the US to a valley they own, where they are set up for anything. Even bleach, seemingly in the tanker load volumes. We have descriptions of the general mayhem, and of people behaving very badly. The gun society of America assures us that plague is not the only problem. The government adopts a slow response, eventually coming up with, transport ceases on Thursday. Not very helpful, as the roads get clogged with dying people. The second part of the book has a second plague – of vampire bats. Swarms of them come through the southern US and kill and strip everything that is still moving. Missing in action through all this is the CDC and any effective government. As a disaster description, they don't get much more disastrous, but the descriptions are not unnecessarily gory.For the benefit of worry worts, in my opinion the disaster is somewhat over-done, but it makes for a chilling story. Nothing is that easily transmitted, and once the presence of the plague is recognized, there should be genuine government action. Stopping all transport immediately is a good start, but of course that would stop the preppers moving, which would ruin the story. The argument that we are now living more densely than before is not true. We may have more people per unit area than before, but our buildings separate people much more efficiently, and we have much better sewage than during previous plagues. The bats also should not proliferate like that. Huge numbers arise from a prolonged glut of food, not a shortage, and vampire bats only feed off warm bodies, not dead ones. Nevertheless, the story makes points, such as the consequences of antibiotics no longer working properly. The story has more ""tell"" than some would like; I am more tolerant of this than many. The story is also not complete, and there will be a book 2, however there is at least a preliminary ending and the book is self-contained. The rating I have given is because the book does give genuine issues for readers to think about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEWID806FMNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VO8YRT2#wasThisHelpful","RWEWID806FMNS","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For imagination and originality this book gets to the top.  For difficulty in reviewing  without providing spoilers, it just about gets to the top too, because part of what it is about seems to be to set the reader a puzzle as to what is going on. Basically, without spoiling (I hope) it seems to be about reincarnation. What we have is three characters that live in different times, but they seem to be living their lives simultaneously. There is also an artificial intelligence from somewhere else in the galaxy. It is also an alternative history, thus when one character looks up Eleanor of Aquitaine in a history book, she has no child called Richard, and he has been replaced by King John the Just.For me, however, the book had a basic problem. It is not that long, and with at least four stories running in parallel, it reads like an introduction to a series, in which all four stories end in cliffhangers, and each with no answers to a huge number of questions. It is obviously the beginning of a series, and you may well need to read it to make sense of the others. My view is the author should have resolved something in this book. On the other hand, Sanders writes reasonably well, and maintains interest despite the problem he has set himself. This could end up as a classic epic, or perhaps it will not. I think it is worth giving the author a chance, but for me, the next one in the series must resolve something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQCKABWTFSLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX75TKU#wasThisHelpful","R2IQCKABWTFSLO","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story is set on the island of Paui, a supposed polynesian island somewhere in the western Pacific that had previously been under Japanese control, then some sort of American Trust Territory after the war. The background is that over the years the Americans have sent money, and the locals have acquired it and used it to purchase all the good things in life. Smith calls the book ""A tropical tale of mischief and romance"". It is a rather difficult book to describe, and the nearest I can come to it is to compare it with a certain class of movie, the French comedy/farce type movie, where everybody runs around doing ""little things"" that in the greater plot are irrelevant, but generate odd characters and as Smith says, mischief. There is no overall plot although there are a collection of undernourished subplots. Essentially, at the same time a number of foreigners descend on Paui, all intending to use it for nefarious purposes, and apart from two young women, the locals are unbelievably gullible. There are even a couple of terrorists from ""Tyria"", and what they are there for is obscure, even in this book.Think of it as a light-hearted entertainment, with jabs here and there at other worldly goings-on. The writing style is clear, and the author likes short sentences, even to the extent of having them so short the subject of the sentence is omitted. Another characteristic is that many sections start out with something like ""he"" did this, then that . ..  It can take over half a page to work out who ""he"" is this time. David Smith has clearly had a lot of fun writing this book. It is fun to read, but it could have been more so with slightly more conventional writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LFFUXAUXWNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N396Q3A#wasThisHelpful","R33LFFUXAUXWNW","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the more complex books you will find, and it is almost impossible to describe without spoiling. The plot is reasonably simple. Angela Crown has her fiancé die, and she is extremely distressed. She begins reading, and decides the novels she is reading are totally unfair to the characters and the plots need drastic alteration, then suddenly she discovers a way to enter the novel world, where she attempts to save Sara, the main character of ""Sara's Tragedy"". The problem is, the plot is written, so how can a character change that which is written? One way is to take a book into the novel world and start tearing out pages! Then again, is it really written? Perhaps the novelist writes the novel as the characters take over? In some ways, there is a little lacking of self-consistency here, but never mind. The story can be read on several levels, and various readers could very well interpret this quite differently. I think most readers would reject the first level, i.e. what is written is it. The next level involves Angela recovering (or otherwise) from a mental problem, and in the ""real world"" she is continuously seeing the psychiatrist, Dr Price. However, when she is in the ""novel world"" she also informs the characters there that she came from a higher-level novel world, so it is not that easy. At the next level you can choose between satire, allegory, and I am not going to spoil this by giving my interpretation. I found this book remarkably imaginative and highly original, and it held my attention far more than many others I have read recently. Highly recommended by me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPUM7UAV65JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMY0YPM#wasThisHelpful","R2LPUM7UAV65JL","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is a novella, not a novel, and it is quite short at about 108 pages. The town of Frederick has a serial killer, who seems to like killing young women, usually by strangulation, so to the extent that the object of the exercise is to find who did it, this is a mystery/crime story. The prologue, and some later chapters, put the reader inside the mind of the killer, and it tries to give the mind of such a killer. I have no idea whether this is valid, but it is certainly presented well. However, the bulk of the book is from the point of view of Nate Castle, a professor at the local community college and a doctor of forensic psychology, and therefore a consultant to the local police force. Or more precisely, he should be but he is not because he is habitually drunk. About eighty percent of the book involves Nate trying to stop drinking, and shows what the life of a severe alcoholic drying out is like. Thus when Nate goes to a crime scene, he does not really look for clues; instead he looks for somewhere to throw up. Even worse, the senior detective is, well, an alcoholic. The book is rather light on police work, and because we see through Nate's eyes, we are short on clues, partly because Nate cannot focus enough. There is police work, and in the end they follow a logical approach, but because Nate cannot focus, we do not see this until it is explained. Rush inserts some red herrings as well, and at the end, when things are resolved, I was far from convinced the story was self-consistent, but I cannot justify that remark without spoilers. As a crime story, I found it to be fairly indifferent in the sense of the process of solving the crime, as opposed to the crimes themselves, but as a story about an alcoholic drying out, while it is somewhat grim and unpleasant, and with the caveat that I do not know enough about this to know whether what is presented is valid, this was quite intense and convincing. The grading I give is based on that, and not as a crime story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GO3I7RDXMJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2AZY78#wasThisHelpful","R37GO3I7RDXMJO","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered a free copy to review this, and since Amelie is another New Zealand author, I could not refuse. While a reviewer does not need to like what he reads to review it properly, I started with a  little trepidation because Love Child is a romance, well outside my usual reading, but to my surprise, I found it quite enjoyable. The story starts in Auckland with Amber becoming pregnant and Dom, the father, without any warning disappearing off to France. Four years later, he returns, finds Amber, and demands an answer to his question. The plot is somewhat unlikely, but is based upon the well-worn premise that while the reader may guess or know what is going on, the protagonists steadfastly create blocks to an increasingly ludicrous situation from unraveling. This is, of course, the method used by Shakespeare in many of his comedies. In this case, Amber does not answer. Indeed, she cannot, because she has no idea what the question is. Dom, ask the question! But then if he did that, there would be no story. What happens next is each encounter simply annoys each participant, their feelings get put away to ferment, and the pressure builds. Then, when it looks as if that has been played enough, another problem arises. Then another, each one leading to more fermentation. Then Dom actually sees the child and realizes he is a father. Oops – they are at it again, with plenty of help from outside. Strictly speaking, this becomes a love (or hate) rectangle. The characters tend to be extreme. Dom is very rich, very good looking (can't we have a below average looker?) and has the empathy quotient of an alligator. Emma, a further cause of trouble, has an EQ that makes a tarantula seem like good company. Jamie, the three-year-old, makes some typical three-year-old contributions. The story is well structured, and keeps up regular intensity and quieter parts, it is well written and maintains interest, as long as the basic premises are accepted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11T1WOL2TJEUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H3WWVS#wasThisHelpful","R11T1WOL2TJEUG","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story starts with five-year-old Henry Brooke walking home from school through the ""Cow Path"" with elder sister Laura, who runs ahead of him. Henry never makes it home, which is a parent's worst nightmare.  This is not helped by the fact that Adam Brooke comes from a very rich family, Antonia does not and she was apparently ""not approved"" as suitable for Adam by the family, so Adam has more or less left his family. The story starts with the blame game, the guilt game (Henry should not have been left to walk home alone), but then we suspect he may have been playing in the cemetery and hence the keeper, Elias Hatch, is a suspect. Perhaps Henry was killed in an accident, perhaps he was kidnapped, the author takes the reader through all the possibilities that might have happened, all of which is hindered by the fact that apart from a cap, there is no sign of Henry. There is a sighting of Henry, or was there? Then we get questions of the supernatural, and religion also plays a part, including occasional returns to Helena (Flavia Julia Helena Augusta, wife of Constantius) in the fourth century. In short, the basic question is, what happened to Henry, and what are the effects of his disappearance on his parents, and also, what is going on in this book? The title is apt in more ways than one.One of the oddities of this story is there are so many possibilities that I cannot even assign the book to a genre without providing spoilers. The writing of events happening is very skillful. There was one scene where I had more or less guessed in advance what the ""surprise"" would be, but nevertheless the scene was so well written that it still held interest. The author has a love of writing scene descriptions, and some may find she overdoes it. If you don't know what this Cow Path looks like at the end of the book, it is not the author's fault. On the other hand, I would have preferred more attention to giving a description of the local geography, because to some extent the story depends on it. While there were one or two parts of the plot that I thought failed the logic inspection (such as why character X was really at place Y at that time) overall it is an interesting and imaginative book, and even if you find the ending a little hard to take on board, I think you will find the story holds your attention quite nicely while reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SKV4QLQR26Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJH944U#wasThisHelpful","R6SKV4QLQR26Z","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is set in a somewhat anarchic future where there seem to be only isolated segments of law and order, and the book, which is the second in a series, follows the adventures of Inspector Ryo Trop and Lieutenant Zmuda, and many others. It is set in a variety of places, the most exotic of which is Grytviken, in South Georgia. The basic story starts with the murders of some orbital scrap metal collectors, the murders being committed by the use of a strange particle beam weapon, which raises an interesting observation: this future has a very mixed technology. A really strange weapon is deployed, yet there seems to be no technology that shows the arrival of the perpetrators. You can't easily sneak up on someone in space.The book is easy to  read, it flows well, but the background is a little difficult to follow at first, and that is probably because it uses the ""show – not tell"" technique, and the author may be assuming that the reader has read volume 1. My preference would be for a little explaining of the background, however, while I had not read the first volume, I was not disappointed, so it can stand alone. The writing also involves a lot of one-sentence paragraphs. While it follows a criminal investigation, there is not a lot of police work, other than taking DNA evidence and the likes. A pleasant read that does not involve much reader's effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVW04W0YA6RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEEELSU#wasThisHelpful","R3VVW04W0YA6RJ","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the first of an epic that offers competition to Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising.  The plot is basically that Russia and China set off World War III, first by launching a sneak attack by infiltrating agents, then by set piece military invasions. It has a rather long introduction that introduces some key characters in peacetime, it establishes Farman's credentials relating to the British army, and somewhat surprisingly, it offers an abbreviated section that could have been expanded into an excellent thriller. Farman may have a future as a thriller writer. We then get on to the actual war, which Farman writes from the point of view of the British squaddie, and of individuals in other parts of the war, such as fighter pilots and naval officers. He also writes about the politics going on, and here the British soldier's attitude to politicians shows through a little. Stand To is largely about a hiding the allies take as the Russian forces predominate, although naturally the chosen squads fight bravely and successfully. One of the problems of writing an epic like this is that the chosen characters should largely survive, so that aspect means that the overall losses are not noticed amongst the key characters.The book is easily read, and the reasons I really liked it are there are realistic details of the British infantryman, there are details (such as Velcro tabs) that most people would never consider, and there are details of how the infantryman fights. The book stays away from strategy, apart from the political ructions that come from a retreat, where a badly mauled unit wants to be replaced while it regroups. The fighting retreat is probably the hardest of all military operations to get right, and Farman shows the general incompetence that arises when politicians get in the road of military requirements.  The book is obviously the precursor to more, and where it finishes is clearly not an end, but it should give the reader a good taste of what is likely to follow. I enjoyed reading Red Storm Rising, but I actually felt this was better from the soldiers' point of view, hence the rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O1B24474XWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDYOV14#wasThisHelpful","R10O1B24474XWP","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The time is 1919, the war is over, and an ex-RFC pilot, James Maxted, learns that his father, a senior British diplomat, has died by falling off a roof in Paris. At the same time, an important conference involving the victors is going on, James suspects that the death of his father was no accident. James' elder brother inherits everything, including the baronetcy, and wants the father's death to be buried, and just about everyone else shows little interest, nevertheless with a lot of effort, very gradually James becomes involved in an ever-increasingly broad range of suspicious characters, and it becomes increasingly difficult to decide who is friend or foe.The story is well-written, but because of the number of characters, the build-up is slow.  On the other hand, the action is realistic and the story plausible, which is good. Then James uncovers the truth about his father in a climatic scene that occurs about 80 pages before the end. This scene itself has more questions than answers, though, and if this were the ending, it was almost in the deus ex machina category. If this were to be avoided, I felt that the next 80 pages were going to be exciting. However, I was wrong, and if anything, more threads were uncovered than were resolved, and the reason became clear: it ended nowhere, and the last 80 pages were really a slow build-up to the sequel. Overall, the writing held my interest nicely, the background felt plausible, but I did not like the way it ended. I do not mind a book ending with an indication that there will be more, as this is inevitable in a trilogy, but it should finish the main aspect of the book, and this does not. It identifies the reason for the father's death, but the way it does it requires a very major something else going on for which there have been no reasonable clues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTF4SEZ2HTKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJES50C#wasThisHelpful","R3OTF4SEZ2HTKM","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it is book 2 of a series, with one reservation it is a stand-alone book in the fantasy genre. The writing frequently refers to other entities, many of them mythological, but some may be in the previous book. This referencing to things of external origin is the one aspect that spoils for me this otherwise very good writing, although I suppose that many writers and readers strongly favour this approach. T. S. Elliot comes to mind. The book assumes the multiverse (Hugh Everett III has a lot t answer for!) but unlike what we see, here the main objection to that theory (there is no sign of interference between worlds) no longer applies. Rafe is a Walker, who has the magical ability to cross between worlds when he sees an interface, and for him they come very frequently. In the book, Rafe, two others, and a wolf, walk through a vast number of worlds, and Lovil excels at describing these, giving a moderate description that gives the ""feel"" of the world without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. The basic story is that from somewhere else there is something called ""The Scourge"" which threatens to annihilate life on various worlds, and Rafe and company must do something to stop The Scourge. They walk through various worlds, collecting various Gods, mythological characters, and purveyors of magic, and take them to ""The field of battle"", which is on some sort of planar world where another is closely parallel above. The ending was a let-down for me; it was a battle of who had more magic, and that is not for me, although it may be desirable for other readers.For imagination, the book is excellent, but for me there were two serious problems. The first is that there were no real problems to solve. They do not even have to follow a map, because it appears that it matters not where they walk because they will always follow the right path. The second is, there is no tension. The party walks through the story, more or less unimpeded. There is no reason to believe this party will not end up in the right place. For example, in the Lord of the Rings, we more or less can guess that Frodo will get to the volcano, but on the way he meets all sorts of dangers. This sort of thing does not occur in this book, so while the setting is well worth five stars, the story-telling fails for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGMKHB4G1B28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDIAT4E#wasThisHelpful","R2XGMKHB4G1B28","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This appears to be a first effort, and it is a good one. It is best described as lying somewhere between science fiction and fantasy (where depends on your definitions) and is set somewhere near the end of the 21st century. Human population has expanded intolerably, lifetimes are almost doubled, the planet is under pressure, and hence society has taken a novel way out: hibernation. Everyone volunteers to get an implanted chip and report at periodic intervals to be put to sleep, to wake up some time later so that the waking population at any time is at reasonable levels. Of course, criminals do not do this, as they fear they may not wake. There is also an illegal way out: swapping bodies. How that works is unclear because while one party benefits, the other party is not mentioned in the book. And there needs to be policing of this policy, and one such policewoman is Jennifer Logan. Jennifer's father had a secret that he buried before he died; Jennifer finds it: an object called a histeridae, and it has remarkable properties, including mind control. Unfortunately, the powers that be know she has found it, and they want it, meanwhile Jennifer finds all is not well with officialdom. Jennifer becomes hunted.The story now becomes a basic chase/escape story coupled with a quest of Jennifer's to find out what is going on. There is the odd ""hole"" in the story, but if you overlook those you have a genuinely imaginative and exciting story, well-written, and with one of the better long action sequences that I have seen. The book is the first in a series, but it has a very clean ending, and can be considered self-contained, but with an incentive to wait for the next one.

He later fights in World War II, gets stranded behind enemy lines in the Ardennes, and for some incomprehensible reason, tries to escape by going deeper into German territory, where he comes acroos one of the camps, and one inmate, the Jewess Rosita. He eventually marries Rosita and returns to the US, and with Hershel, one of his men in the army and who happens to have skill with welding, with the aid of acquired German welding technology sets up as a pipeline laying company in the Southern US oilfields. There they run into the worst features of unregulated capitalism, greed, anti-Semitism, the sleazy movie business, organized crime, McCarthyism, and the unfaithfulness of Hershel's wife, Linda Gail.The book was described as a thriller, but I would rather think of it as a historical novel, that just happens to be very recent. The descriptions and atmosphere are overpowering. I cannot comment on the accuracy, but the book certainly reads as if the author certainly knows what he is writing about. It is a telling blow about justice at the time; if a crooked cop, without any evidence at all, called someone a Communist, their life became hell. This is probably accurate. The fact that said Communist happened to be the wife of someone following very successfully the Capitalist dream was irrelevant. The story is very well-written in terms of writing, and the atmosphere, etc,, and with one exception, the characters, are definitely five star material. However, for me there were two problems. The first was the character of Weldon. He does very strange and self-destructive things quite erratically and for no reason. If he is to do something strange, there should be a clue as to why for it to convince me.

"Kenneth Lawrence Juss has a poor start to life, being in a large family with parents that are at the bottom of the parenting scale. As a boy he is removed from his parents by Child Support and sent to a ""home"" with a number of other boys. There he is bullied, abused, and forced to assist with certain crimes. Nevertheless, he escapes by using what is effectively blackmail, but described as a gratuity, and with the proceeds he becomes a lawyer and changes his name to Lawrence Juste. The book runs two parallel strands: one as a boy, and one as a mature man who has just lost his wife in a road accident, the driver of which has never been found. The future looks rosy, he may be made a High Court Judge, but then his past starts to catch up with him when he is asked to defend a young boy Danny, who seems to have a problem very similar to that which he would have had as a child. The deeper he investigates this child's life, the deeper the hole he finds that he is digging for himself, aided seemingly by his dead wife.The book is well written, the scenes very well described, most of the characters are very plausible with possibly one exception. Lawrence is supposed to be a really top lawyer, yet there are obvious things he should do to get out of this hole. Whether they would work is another matter, but instead of trying them, we get an excellent description of a man descending into a trough of depressing self-made misery. I would have expected such a senior and successful person to put up slightly more of a fight. The book is not exactly uplifting, and shows some depressing aspects to life in modern England for those on the poorer side of the economy. The plot is extremely well synthesized, although in my opinion the level of coincidence does require a little getting used to, nevertheless, that the coincidences are there is part of the plot. It is the first of a trilogy, and hence the sorry mess is not resolved, and the ending is perhaps a little abrupt, although in part the issue with Danny is resolved for the present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YGHPBSRP91Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M37OUPY#wasThisHelpful","R12YGHPBSRP91Z","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a mystery crime story that might better be described as a crime drama set in Georgia in which Moriah Dru and Richard Lake try to unravel . .  well, that is for the reader. The background is quite realistic sounding, and while I have never been there, I felt as if I understood something of the place. The story is easy to read, and the plot is mainly developed through dialogue, which Gerrie Finger writes very well. The conversations seem realistic, even to the extent that natural conversations tend to wander and these ones do too. That means the plot tends to slow at times, while various side issues are dealt with. Unfortunately, when simple text is required, it tends to be brief, and you have to slow down and really read it. There are two major strands to the plot, and there are a number of side issues. Regarding detection, there are a number of things that happen that are actually irrelevant. Yes, real detection will be like this, but here they end up being forgotten. In a story, if something bizarre happens, I would prefer some sort of explanation. Accordingly, if you want a mystery where you try to solve it in advance by picking up clues, this is not the book for you. The protagonists also do things but the explanation for why is short. I cannot elaborate without spoiling, other than to note that Moriah starts off searching for Damian, then appears to abandon that, and when the person controlling her pay wants to stop payment, she protests strongly. Um, if you are not actually doing what the paymaster has paid you to do, does he not have the right to stop payment?I suspect Gerrie Finger has been to writing classes or discussion groups because two major current ""fads"" are ""show, don't tell"", and eliminate adverbs around conversation, and to avoid boredom, avoid ""said"". This book starts off following these well, but in my opinion, too well. I would have preferred a little ""tell"" just to let me know who was what where, and some of the very long conversations with no tags at all left me confused at times as to who was actually talking. This may be just me, but I like the odd little anchor here and there so I can follow what is happening. A consequence of this for me was that the whole did not seem to have tension carrying it along, although it does make quite a good drama. The book is essentially a cozy mystery, but there is one extended action sequence that also tended to be more a sequence of small actions rather than an overall tense whole. It is the failure to explain why protagonists switch what they are doing, and the number of loose ends, that led me to downgrade this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABK2JZLY8A6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX9AQLU#wasThisHelpful","R1ABK2JZLY8A6I","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack Contino is head of detectives in Dennis, Cape Cod, having left Boston to get away from the excessive violence and have a quiet graze until retirement. Unfortunately, he forgot to get the author alongside. His grazing is upset by what appears to be a mob hit, and in true detective style, he visits the site and asks a few questions, but before anything of significance can get going, there is another murder. As the book progresses, there is a number of them, such that Jack actually doesn't do much detection; he just visits murder scenes. The book is well written in that the pages fly past, it is tolerably light-hearted and the major characters seem reasonable. It is a crime story, but it is not heavily laden with police methodology, largely because Jack does not do too much of it. On the second murder, there is a wealth of information, and as is usual, most is dross, but for some reason Jack gives up in the middle. The author switches to being inside the villain, but here you get very little idea of what drives him, although in fairness, it may be that nobody can really understand a serial killer.The book certainly moves, and there is never a dull moment. It is a shade formulaic, thus I guessed the essence of the endgame about two-thirds through the story, but I still found it to be a very interesting read. The absence of some basic police procedure was unfortunate because it would have saved a lot of bodies and perhaps there was an element of keeping the story going with bodies. There was also one part that really surprised me: a report in which for a murder victim ""they found iodine oxide, a reddish brown powder, on the wall, ceiling and floor of the apartment and on her body."" Really? Where did this come from? There is only one stable iodine oxide (I2O5) which is white and is a powerful oxidizer, and is rather too expensive for this. There are two other yellow oxides (probably iodonyl iodate and iodine triiodate) that are somewhat unstable, difficult to make and the latter is very hygroscopic, in short this scene is just plain wrong. So the biggest mystery for me is where did the author come up with this, and why? Leaving that aside, however, this is an extremely good book for those who want to lie on the beach and be entertained, and not think about it too much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JV9UNOSBLXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2E9G8G#wasThisHelpful","R15JV9UNOSBLXG","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a thought-provoking account of how Miroshnichenko sees the effects of the web on humanity. The impressions are largely formed as a consequence of what has happened in Russia, and since Russian society is not the same as, say, in the US, some of his propositions may not apply in the same way there. The book is reasonably easy to read, and the author is quite clear in what he says, and bearing in mind he appears to be Russian, his command of English is excellent. There is no reason whatsoever to fear this book on the basis of language. Furthermore, he references many comments, and has over 70 references for further consideration.He starts by arguing there are two sorts of people: the technocrats who want everything clearly defined, and the humanists, who prefer a more fuzzy description, and he is clearly in the latter group. Unfortunately, I am probably in the former group, as I do like my terms defined so I know what the sentences mean. Accordingly, there are a number of assertions, but I am far from convinced that they are general, and in some cases, he is not exactly consistent. Thus he proposes a Viral Editor (i.e. the web self-edits and self-corrects provided sufficient attention is paid to the post). He discusses this at some length, then suddenly announces this does not apply to politics, but later he applies it to politics. As stated above, it is thought provoking. You may not agree with everything Miroshnichenko says, but you cannot but be impressed by the way he has said it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAZCQ6ARU0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLT7H0E#wasThisHelpful","R2QAZCQ6ARU0C","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a spy story, CIA vs Russians in modern Russia. The sparrow is a young woman trained to seduce and entrap Western agents, or people who might have information worth while to Russia, and the sparrow in this story is Dominika, who is never fully committed to her sparrow job. She is sent to entrap Nate, a CIA agent. Added to the mix are MARBLE, a highly placed Russian who is giving information to the CIA, and SWAN, a highly placed American giving information to the Russians. Then throw in a range of extras, and we have a really exciting book. For me there were two important aspects to this book that set it above most others in this sort of genre. The first is the CIA part sounds very authentic; I could see that agents might behave like they do here. This should not be a total surprise because Jason Matthews is apparently a retired CIA operative, and his wife was also with the CIA for 35 years. Here we have someone who knows what they are writing about. The Russian part was, for me, less convincing and there is a tendency throughout the book to promote the CIA and denigrate the Russians, but I guess that goes with the thought that your team have to be the best, someone has to be worst for the story, so that is them. The second great point is that the plot moves along nicely, and just when you think it is starting to get predictable, you get plot twists that are really surprising. Not only that, but it is well-written. One added feature (actually a detraction for me) is there is a focus on food (probably a consequence of TV cooking programs); everyone ends up eating somewhere, and at the end of the chapter you get a free recipe for how to make one of the things that were eaten. Unfortunately, proportions are not mentioned, so amateur cooks could end up with just about anything. Notwithstanding that, this book is well worth reading if you like the spy genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377GUF3I82X5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J4L4KY#wasThisHelpful","R377GUF3I82X5R","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This appears to be the fifth in the series involving the Canadian agents Justin and Carrie, who at home are mild-mannered and somewhat non-descript, so my first thoughts were, what's with the title? It soon turns out that the rogues are two others, caught up in a plot by sources of questionable ethics to acquire enriched uranium oxide (I am not quite sure why – processed uranium would be more useful) and then become residents of a North Korean prison. Justin and Carrie have to do something about these two. Yep, ""Mission Impossible"" rides again, only this time, in principle, it should be really impossible. In fact Plan A should not work; it does not so they resort to plan B. Oops, no plan B so improvise. For the discerning reader, try to work out why neither of these plans should work.  On the other hand, it is a great read without making any effort. The book is an action thriller that is very well written and Jones manages one of the longer action sequences I have seen. The North Koreans do not exactly shine, nevertheless the strategy employed is reasonable, even if it does require some rather stodgy Koreans. The book starts with two basic strands, and although to start with you might wonder how these can come together, at the end they do, and quite plausibly. The writing is fluid and is very easy to read, and the pages fly. Excellent reading for vacation spare time, and pretty good for other times too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTTOBYN2Y06T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LE42KAY#wasThisHelpful","RDTTOBYN2Y06T","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a cosy romantic fantasy, with a little science thrown in, in the form of genetic engineering. The story largely follows Pericles, who finds a book with instructions to carry out three experiments, although I missed the third, if it were there. The first was to get the GE juices going, and the second was to engineer Pegasus. This is sheer fantasy, but fair fantasy, and Pegasus takes Pericles to meet some ancients, and it is these the title refers to, not some Jurassic Park concept. The story is somewhat existential in nature, and in parts it takes some following, and it may well be that I never really got to grips with it. Thus there is a bank robbery elsewhere, but what is taken varies in the story, or maybe there was more than one such robbery. There is an ill-defined war going on elsewhere as well, but none of this really impacts on the story.For me, there were problems that would be removed by good editing. The first is Lambrakis has adopted (but not always used self-consistently) an idiosyncratic style of punctuation for speech, and at times I was unsure whether text was conversational or not, or if it were, to whom it should be assigned. The scenes also sometimes jump abruptly so that for a while what you read does not make sense. This could be due to the author leaving three spaces in the script to change scenes. A problem with this technique is that ebook compiling programs usually ignore these spaces, and such breaks have to have symbols, such as stars, between the sections.  Worse, English is presumably not Lambrakis' native language, and at times the sentence construction was either awkward or ungrammatical. This is understandable, and in one sense Lambrakis has done very well to write this in English, but unfortunately the text is sometimes quaint at best. One example: ""All of his friends were surprised upon listening to Apollo's suggestions astounded"". Were the suggestions astonishing or were the friends, or Apollo, astounded? Finally, it was not always clear what was going on. From a structural point of view, the first chapter might be extremely important to the story, or then again, perhaps it is not, depending on how you interpret what goes on later. Perhaps that is intentional, and the existential nature is the intended strong point. On the other hand, Lambrakis has come up with the material that could be used to possibly create a great Greek tragedy, but to do that, he has to address why Pericles got the book, and later on, why Pericles was important, and why he made the decision he did, bearing in mind the consequences, of which it is not clear he knew. For me, while I prefer neither the nature of the story nor the meaning of sentences to be unclear, I can usually tolerate the first, where the reader has to draw conclusions, but not both.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26409EIX5EVHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGL76YW#wasThisHelpful","R26409EIX5EVHX","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is another that whether it is for you or not is highly dependent on what you wish to read. The grading above reflects my personal view, but I can see that there would be a number of others who would see it differently, both for and against. It could best be described as an explicitly erotic thriller. Before the story starts, the author warns that this contains adult material, and discretion is required. At the end, he confesses he thinks sex sells. That should give some clue as to what you will find in this book. What you get from the thriller part is that Jack Lazar, in California, receives a letter from a friend in Paris that contains a key, and the message that said friend is in trouble. Could he keep the key safe?  Some might take the sensible option, say yes, and do just that, but Jack, plus key, are soon off to Paris, where he finds his friend has disappeared. It takes hardly any time to deduce that the key is to a bank safe deposit box, so Jack is off to the right bank, with his friend's passport, and he apparently looks sufficiently like the passport photo that he finds out what is in the box. (He wouldn't need to run into an ex-East German border guard – those guys REALLY looked at passport photos and you.) Anything more would be a spoiler, but what happens next is that Jack is tracking down the significance of the item, but wherever he goes, he immediately runs into bad guys, who really want the item, and are prepared to kill to get it, and kill once they have it. This leads to fights in which, in my opinion, Jack does not show a lot of flair, but through dumb luck he seems to win through. For me, this failed to generate tension, largely because once a few pages flew by, it seemed to be time for yet another one of those explicit sex scenes, which, on the whole, had little to do with the plot. Jack is also not one of the brightest bulbs, but he is nothing if not persistent. Character development was thin, the level of coincidence high, and for me the plot itself had quite a few holes. However, the writing is smooth, and if you want a thriller that does not make too many demands on you, and you want a lot of very explicit sex scenes, then this book is for you. As for the rating, if you want lot of explicit sex and a romp of a thriller that does not need a lot of thought, this is worth five stars; if you want to think, have a thriller that is realistic, and no explicit sex, this is one star. So I averaged down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VONQSR8MY6IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPURVVE#wasThisHelpful","R2VONQSR8MY6IS","A1A6KB3O3GANX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A6KB3O3GANX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
