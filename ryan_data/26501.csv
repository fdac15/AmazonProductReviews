"I started taking probiotics due to the onset of diverticulitis.  They have proven effective in stopping the pain.  Other reasons for taking them include counteracting the detrimental effects of antibiotics (which destroy both good and bad bacteria, indiscriminately) or just as a way to build up good bacteria. The brand that the doctor originally prescribed was very expensive, and probiotics tend to be expensive in general.This 4X Pro-B brand is just as effective as, but better value than, the other brands I have used.  I also like the blister packs with the days printed on them, so that I can keep track of whether I have already taken one that day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REAORVGRINGQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI4OLTA#wasThisHelpful","REAORVGRINGQW","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used Cascade Complete Actionpacs for some time and have been pleased with them, mostly because they are so convenient.  I have a tendency to use far too much detergent/washing powder/whatever and these pacs oblige me to use the right amount and avoid waste.  You need to keep your hands dry when handling them, or you can start the casings dissolving.  The container is conveniently shaped and sized for storage in a kitchen cabinet.But, do these Cascade Platinum Actionpacs clean any better than their Cascade Complete cousins?  That's difficult to say.  I have noticed that all the tea stains are removed from cups with this product, so my guess is that they are a little more powerful.These are certainly worth trying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TC2YVC2NXS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD73XJO#wasThisHelpful","R34TC2YVC2NXS9","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remember to cost in the strips and the control solution when considering this purchase.  They are extra and they are essential.  You will use rather more strips than you might think, because you will sometimes make mistakes and have to discard some, and you also need them for the test solution.  Overall, the costs seem reasonable.There are quite a lot of instructions included, and you do need to read everything carefully, because mistakes can damage the unit.  Once you get the hang of it and have used the unit a couple of times, it seems quite straightforward, but you should take it slowly and carefully first time and, I repeat, read all the instructions first.The unit seems to be accurate, in that it agreed with the recent test my doctor had performed.Those with diabetes or pre-diabetes will find this useful, but it is also useful for anyone who simply wants to monitor their health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHWVNW2UIAMKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI4KF56#wasThisHelpful","RHWVNW2UIAMKY","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following my annual exam, my doctor recommended me taking vitamin D.  That surprised me, as I live in southern California and get a lot of sunshine.  But apparently, as we get older, we need a lot of vitamin D.  I started with 2,000 IU but the doctor has now ramped that up to 4,000 IU.  If you are getting on in years, you may want to ask your doctor what he recommends with regard to vitamin D.This particular brand is outwardly just like the other brand I used – small, easy to swallow.  But these also have the potency I need, have a reassuring set of ingredients, and are low-priced.

"I suppose if you are following the South Beach diet, you might want to incorporate these, or another of their range of snack bars, into it.  Even if you are not, but are looking for a snack bar, you should try these.  They are high in fiber and protein, but also in calories.  They make a point of not having artificial sweeteners, but that means they do have natural sugars, and a lot of them.They are perfect for an after-workout snack.  I always need something after a vigorous workout, but feel guilty eating a regular candy bar.  This is a good, healthier, healthy(ish) alternative.  As I have not done that vigorous workout for a while, I'll have to think up another excuse for eating them.I like the texture - slightly chewy, slightly crunchy, but not too much of either.  I also like the taste, which is somewhat unusual, with vanilla and yoghurt overtones.Although these are a little too sweet for my taste, I think I'll adopt them as my mid-morning snack, and find some way to compensate for those 200 Calories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3993IG9OW22I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C878UL4#wasThisHelpful","R3993IG9OW22I7","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A monopod is a great help in steadying a camera, and to have it double as a walking stick is a good idea.  This one is good quality; sturdy, robust, but light.  It extends from 18 inches to 59 (not counting the removable bulb), so your viewfinder will be around 5 feet high when you use it.The screw locking holds well, so you can extend it to the length you want for a walking stick and use it with confidence.The compass in the removable bulb at the top looks to be of limited use, but I suppose they may as well make some use of the bulb.If your hands are not as steady as you'd like, and you could use a walking stick, this is a good purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSR1EXX6RL77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRA49AW#wasThisHelpful","R3KSR1EXX6RL77","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first impression when unpacking this was how light (and flimsy) it was.  But that did not prove to be a problem, as it is not likely to have to withstand hard knocks or rough handling.  The small size is actually an advantage - it fits discreetly beside the toilet.It worked very well.  I got more use out of each disk, and more thorough cleaning, than I expected.I see that some other reviewers report a problem with removing the disks.  I did not have that problem with mine.  Pulling the trigger released the disk, every time.

"This is a cream, not a foam or a gel.  It will not lather at all well and is not intended to.  Nor does it hydrate particularly well, like the gel I usually use does.

"I am a great fan of Listerine Original Antiseptic mouthwash, which I have used daily for years, and of Listerine Whitening Original, which I use when I remember to.  I like the clean feeling that the Original Antiseptic mouthwash leaves me with.I received this Listerine Total Care Whitening mouthwash as a free sample, and found the taste repulsive.  Not just bad, but horribly bad.  There is clearly some ingredient in it which does not suit my taste and may not suit yours.I would certainly recommend trying the Listerine range of products but, given that this item is not cheap, you might avoid it unless you can get a free trial taste of it first.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LI2SPTDOLMHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VUL8IY#wasThisHelpful","R3LI2SPTDOLMHF","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used a few of these Knorr sides and am happy with them.  They are a quick, simple way of turning some chicken into a tasty meal.This variety has the creamy texture that it promises, especially if you use milk and margarine or butter, instead of just water.I fry the chicken with onion and mushroom, then add the water/milk/margarine and the packet contents, and stir and simmer.Tolerance to spiciness varies a lot from one person to another.  I would class this as very mild, but for some people with a very low tolerance, even this will be too much.  Some like it hot, and you could always spice it up with chipotle sauce if desired.I don't think any food product as processed as this can really be of much nutritional value, but it gives a convenient, tasty starch base to whatever meat or vegetables you serve with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CF9V4RROYVQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4ASPWG#wasThisHelpful","R2CF9V4RROYVQ5","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This a beautiful collection of rarely heard orchestral songs by Sibelius, performed by the Finnish lyric soprano Soile Isokoski and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra.The title track ""Luonnotar"", at nearly nine minutes the longest track, is described as a tone poem for soprano and orchestra.  It is known to performers as a fiendishly difficult piece.  The text is from the first part of the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, and deals with the creation of the world.  Luonnotar is the Spirit of Nature in Finnish mythology.  The music is every bit as dramatic as the theme would suggest, and Isokoski's vocal agility and power are very impressive.  It takes a great singer to avoid being overwhelmed by the orchestra in a piece like this.In addition, there are 18 further songs, all based on Finnish and Swedish texts (Swedish was actually Sibelius' first language).  They are all fine, all very dramatic, and include songs like Driftwood and Swim, Duck Swim, which prevent the overall experience from becoming too somber.Very highly recommended.[PeterReeve]","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDQQJXGPMM1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBHSHC#wasThisHelpful","RXDQQJXGPMM1B","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was Maria's debut solo album, released 10 years after the release of the eponymous The Even Dozen Jug Band, of which band she was a member.  She has gone on to make more than 30 more solo albums, though oddly enough not - so far as I can see - a ""Greatest Hits"" or similar compilation.  If you are new to her, this album is still the best place to start.Her only big hit single was Midnight at the Oasis, the second track on this album (the B side was Any Old Time, the album's first track).  It was written by David Nichtern, who plays acoustic guitar on this and some other tracks.  The song became notorious in the 70s as the alleged cause of a great many pregnancies and losses of virginity.  Take that as a warning or a recommendation, as you choose.The rather bawdy, or saucy, flavor continues throughout Muldaur's career and is at its strongest on this album in the Blue Lu Barker song Don't You Feel My Leg.  Inevitably, this flirty sauciness has earned Maria the condemnation of feminists, which seems to have bothered her not at all.  At the time of writing this review, she is still performing at the age of 69, and is currently touring with the Bluesiana Boys in what she describes as ""an evening of New Orleans flavored `Swamp Funk', Vintage Blues, & good ol' American Roots Music!""Various shades and interpretations of American Roots is what this album is all about.  There are excellent musicians backing her.  Greg Prestopino's piano on Mad Mad Me, Richard Greene's violin on Walkin' One and Only, and Amos Garrett's electric guitar on Midnight at the Oasis deserve special mention, but it's all good.  Ry Cooder (no less!) plays acoustic guitar on the opening track.Her voice can be a little shrill in the upper register, but never lacks heart and soul, and has a lovely, lilting, lyrical quality.Essential 70s interpretation of some ""good ol' American Roots Music"".[PeterReeve]","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360AI27WTCH1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O54NJO#wasThisHelpful","R360AI27WTCH1G","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was working my way through OUP's A Very Short Introduction series when I discovered the A Brief Insight series.  They have the same texts, but the print is larger, they are hardcover, and they have more illustrations, many in color.  So unless you want a very small book that you can slip into a pocket, the Brief Insight versions are better.For this particular entry in the series, you absolutely must get the Brief Insight version, because the illustrations are essential to the book and they are greatly superior in this version.This is the best introductory text on Postmodernism that I know of.  The scope is very broad, covering (I should say, touching on) all aspects of culture - the arts, science, philosophy and a broad range of sociopolitical issues.  Butler has the correspondingly broad range of knowledge and interests to carry this off.His approach is a critical one.  Rather than just introducing an idea, he will explain it and immediately critique it, encouraging the reader to think about it themselves.  If you have seen some postmodernist art and found it self-indulgent and trivial, then don't let that put you off reading this book - you will find Butler as skeptical as you are.Butler also wrote ""Modernism: A Very Short Introduction"", (I don't think there's a Brief Insight version).  I haven't read it but I guess it would make sense to read that before this entry, if like me you are working your way through the entire series.[PeterReeve]","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMH5OMA7KUPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140276880X#wasThisHelpful","R1PMH5OMA7KUPY","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was a German Jewish banker who was executed in 1738, as a result of charges brought by the many enemies he had made in making his fortune.His story was the subject of many literary treatments, most notably Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel titled Jud Süß.  Feuchtwanger was Jewish, and an outspoken opponent of Nazism, and his portrayal of Oppenheimer was very sympathetic.  In 1934, Lothar Mendes directed a film adaptation of the novel.Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, commissioned a new film version, partly to counteract the Mendes film.  The result, Jud Süß, made in 1940 by Veit Harlan, is very remarkable in many respects.  For one thing, the film is surprisingly entertaining.  It is fast-paced, well acted and the crowd scenes are (for the time) very well done.  This is in stark contrast to the usual propaganda films (see Der Ewige Jude, for example, also made in 1940 at the behest of Goebbels, and which is laughably bad).  One can imagine members of the SS, who were required to see this film, groaning at the thought of having to sit through another propaganda film, being pleasantly surprised as this action-filled costume drama unfolded.The film is also remarkable for its moral ambiguity.  The gentile characters, including the hero - the romantic lead - are really unsympathetic, whereas the Jewish characters - including the title character - come across quite favorably.  The propaganda message - intentionally or not - is that corrupt politicians are more to blame for the social and economic problems than are Jewish bankers.This DVD is a 2-disc package with many extras.  The film print is excellent.  In so many ways, this is a film worth seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JL06Y34S3QB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WGLADS#wasThisHelpful","R3JL06Y34S3QB0","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was happy with my Kindle, but concerned that it seemed very fragile.  It appeared inevitable that it would get dropped or knocked and that would be the end of it.  It really does need a protective case.I like the look and feel of this leather case.  It is thick enough to provide protection but not so bulky that I cannot still keep the kindle in my jacket pocket.  The overall quality and design are good.If you want to prop it open, on a desk or wherever, then you must prop it at a narrow angle or avoid a smooth surface, as it relies only on the surface friction to hold it in place.The hand strap worked well for me and is a nice feature.

"UPDATE (10/2014):  The current seller here on Amazon insists on sending the wrong product.  They send mint-flavored toothpicks (the label is different from what you see on the product page).  The taste is quite different and I find it repulsive.  Claiming a refund is proving difficult.  So 5 stars for the advertised product, 1 star for the seller.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  My dental hygienist remarked on the improvement and asked me what I had been doing differently.  The only thing different was that I had started using these toothpicks.  She was very impressed with the results.They are obviously good at dislodging food particles from between teeth, but just as importantly, you can run them along the gum lining, where they disturb the bacterial growth and stop it building up.Tea tree oil is a natural, general purpose antiseptic.  The oil's scent is distinct but not too strong on these picks.  Of course, whether or not you like the scent is entirely a matter of personal taste.Well worth trying especially if, like me, you hate flossing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ISKRR3O64UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00142FOYU#wasThisHelpful","R14ISKRR3O64UG","ABTUNH7645QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABTUNH7645QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I chose this one after looking around quite a bit for a ""personal"" laptop. I didn't want to always be using the work laptop, and I wanted something smallish I could throw in a smaller bag to cart along with me. That said, I've configured it to do all things I do for work -- ssh tunneling with PuTTY, Git, etc. so it's really handy for a secondary work machine if I'm away.In a pinch, I've tethered to my Galaxy Note 3, and that was very easy to do, with pretty good results for having to ssh into a command line on an Ubuntu server.Things I'm not in love with... mine does not have a lighted keyboard. Wah. I don't know how often I've ever found myself needing to type in the dark, so this is a minor gripe. The battery could be better. Really don't expect to get more than four hours of solid work done on this machine without plugging it in. The keyboard can be a bit springy, but this can be fixed. The touch pad isn't nearly as nice as the one on my retina macbook, but this isn't a deal breaker for me.Things that are fabulous... It's very easy to upgrade the RAM to 8GB. It's nearly as easy to add a SECOND HARD DRIVE! I just threw a 480 GB hard drive in mine, and now I have an i5 ultrabook with 8GB of RAM and some 600 GB of hard drive space. Once you open it up to make these upgrades, just throw some small bits of carpet tape under the keyboard and the keyboard is nice and tight with good feedback. To counter the little-bit-wonky touch pad, I snagged a Logitech ultra-thin mouse. This highlights the fact that this machine has bluetooth built in. Works great. This machine definitely rivals any other (full-sized) laptop I've ever had.I don't use it as a tablet, but it's great to think I could. Since buying this and swapping an iPhone for a Galaxy Note 3, I don't really have much use for the iPad anymore.

"In case you didn't know, Bret Easton Ellis was not fond of the movie Less Than Zero. And he seems to have written this book entirely in an effort to spite the movie adaptation of his first novel. But he's taking out his frustrations on us, his dear readers.If anyone wanted any ammunition in their argument that Ellis' talents are overhyped, this is a full belt. Anyone who compares any of his works to J.D. Sallinger should have their library card revoked.With this short work, Ellis has grabbed random handfuls of tricks and gimmicks that seemed to work in his previous books, but they don't stick together in this one. The sex and violence is here, but not in a good way, like in American Psycho. The name-dropping (ugh!) that was so tiresome in Dramarama is here, too. And the Lunar Park pseudo-creepy vibe is kind of recreated. Maybe. I guess. But not really.The main character has an iPhone. He seems to mention this on each of the 160-some pages. I guess iPhones are supposed to be a symbol of the moral depravity that supposedly is the hackneyed Hollywood scene. He wears a hoodie. On more than one occasion. He drives a BMW and he's lost weight. Not really sure what this is all about, as there's never really anything substantial about this little fish that's tossed in the chum. But there are lots of little details like this that just don't matter, at the expense, apparently, of details that might have made any of the characters sympathetic, or any of the myriad plot lines merely believable.This is a mystery that is not engaging. The narrator's hung up on some prostitute the way a fifteen-year-old boy would be infatuated with a seventeen-year-old girl. It just doesn't work this way in the adult world, and it's really boring to read about and figure this to be the driving conflict in the whole story. People die. Just like people do every day. Everyone is evil. Everyone is scheming somehow. Everyone is depraved. Everyone is so one-sided and so thin that you can see the end right through the transparent pages that separate the start from the last page.In the final analysis, I really do feel this is just Ellis flipping a big `ole bird at the movie version of Less Than Zero. Too bad he had to include all of those who were really kind of looking forward to another of his books. Hoping maybe he had started getting closer to where he started. Maybe he feels the same about his readers, too. I don't know. It's kind of easy to think maybe so when you look at the back inner-jacket photo of him grinning over whatever booze he's imbibing.The book has many unanswered questions. The characters themselves pose some in the text. I guess we're supposed to ponder upon their meaning and feel we're getting a peek inside a great philosophical mind, but the real question posed here is, ""what's wrong with writing a novel to tell a story?""","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HWSXZM911R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266109#wasThisHelpful","R14HWSXZM911R2","A1C3QC8IYNJLJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C3QC8IYNJLJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an adorable hat. I unfolded it from the bag it was mailed in, and with in an hour it was in tip top shape. No creases at all. I will say that this hat is a animal hair magnet! But it is easy to wipe off, you don't even need a lint roller. Huge plus in a house with five dogs! The material is very soft, and thick, but it doesn't feel heavy on your head. At first, I was worried that the hat was going to be a little to big, until I took it off and noticed that you can tighten the band on the inside. A wonderful feature, that helps keep the hat from twisting while I am wearing it.I have the blue hat, which is a but darker in person than what is shown. It is a bold, eye-catching color. I love unique hats that every one walking down the street isn't wearing, and this one is right in that category!

"This is a very well built belt. Extremely sturdy, something that you would wear around a farm or do some work in. It is a little thicker than some cheaper belts, perfect for hanging tools, gloves, etc off of. If this belt gets caught on something, it is not going to rip! The stitching is beautifully done, very even and the thread color matches the belt perfectly. The buckle is very sturdy and is attached very well. My husband loves the belt, and was surprised at the quality of it. I received this belt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

"I have three boys under the age of ten. They were so excited when this came in. We opened the lid and the snowman accessories were right on top. One of them was covered in a gel like material, but it wasn't sticky and was easy to remove. perhaps some extra goo from the foam.Once they pulled everything out they were thrilled to get started. They built a snowman in a few minutes, but this has hours of replay. They built melted snowman, snow worms, snow stars, anything you can think of. They played with it for over an hour the first time! When they were done they packed it back away so it wouldn't dry out. When they pulled it out the next day the foam had the same consistency, it wasn't any drier. They happily sculpted and molded again for about an hour, running out to show me their creations and having snow ball fights with their Lego men. This is a wonderful product for kids! I think the elf on the shelf can have a lot of fun with this! I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my true thoughts. definitely worth five stars!

"These copper wired lights are gorgeous, and the settings on them are amazing! You can twirl or place them any which way you please, and the look beautiful. with the dimming settings, they can be used as an eye catcher, or as a back ground light. The multiple flash settings make it great for small Christmas trees, or to draw someones attention to a centerpiece. These would make a great backdrop for photographers as well.You can see in the video all the different settings that the lights have. The copper wire is durable, if it bends, no big deal, it is easily shaped right back into place. Nothing is hot to the touch, so no one is going to get burned. To store you can just wrap the wire around anything, if you didn't keep the original packaging (oops..) An empty paper towel roll works great!

" 1:16 MinsI love this scouring wash cloth. It works great you receive a pack of to wash clothes with purchase. They are very well put together I can see that I won't get a lot of use out of them. Much better than the wire scrubbers. They take off stuck on grime much easier than washcloth, and you can throw them right in the washer, or even your dishwasher, when you're done.

"I was weary of this mat when I received it. My husband didn't even want to try it! I first laid on it with a thin shirt and then put the pillow under my neck. It felt amazing. It doesn't hurt at all, even when you move your body on it a little. I researched a little on the internet and read how to best use it is to lay on it for 20 minutes. So I pulled my phone out and laid down. The neck pillow provides great support while you are reading!I was truly amazed at how great this acupressure works. I have had a kink in my neck for weeks, I even went to a chiropractor about it with no  positive results. When I got up from this mat, it was gone! I could move my neck  both ways without feeling it. The kink did come back the next day, but as I lay down on the mat each day I can tell that it is slowly working the kink out. I had no idea that something this simple could help versus paying money to a chiropractor! My little kink is not fully gone, but I can feel the pain lessening. Additionally I have chronic lower back pain. This mat helps my muscles in my back loosen so that they aren't so tense, and this takes away some of my pain. Well worth the money to use everyday.Another way to use the mat is for energy, by standing on it with socks on. Some say that this is uncomfortable, but I think it feels great, and works wonderfully!The circle points hold up great, they don't bend. You can take the cover off of both the pillow, and the mat to wash them. This is truly a great product to have in your home if you deal with back or neck pain. I received this mat at a discounted price in exchange for my truthful thoughts on the product. If I had known how great this works for taking pain away, I would have invested in the product a long time ago!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6LDMKBK5988/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1SQZBW#wasThisHelpful","R3G6LDMKBK5988","A3JQPRIIGFWUCR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JQPRIIGFWUCR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I was wear of this hat, because it was shipped folded up and seemed flimsy. This did not turn out to be an issue though. I unfolded it and was surprised at how quickly it popped into shape. Within about an hour or so you wouldn't even have known that it had been flat.It does state in the description that you can iron the hat if there are creases. I imagine that a steamer would work as well.The hat being so flexible is actually a nice feature. I have owned a few other hats, fedora's included, that I have had to regretfully throw out. They were stiff, so when they got even the smallest dent in their shape it was not fixable. This hat, I believe that it could get stepped on, and you can easily put it right back into shape. This also makes the hat much lighter than others that I have worn, which is a plus!The stitching is even spaced all around, and the ribbon is placed securely from the top. The bottom of the ribbon is not glued or sewn down, but this hasn't been an issue. It stay in place. I have the wine colored one, and it is beautiful. just in time to wear for the holiday seasons!

"I have over ten cast iron pots and pans that I don't use because I don't look forward to the task of cleaning them. This cleaner has taken that fear away. I pulled one pot out that needs to be re-seasoned and threw a bit of water in it. I was amazing that just swishing the chain cleaner around a couple of times was already removed the rust and excessive dust! It is so much easier than a washcloth and salt. The chain is well put together and not going to come apart, you can hang it to dry, easy to clean itself, and is amazing quality size. My kids love using this product!I noticed some people saying this doesn't come with a manual. There are a few different ways that you can clean cast iron. I prefer to use oil and salt, and then let it dry at a low heat. Your cast iron pot should have it's own instructions, depending upon how it's seasoned.The accessories that come with it are an added bonus. It is much easier to hold the pot with the silicone handle than a hot pad, and the plastic scrapers are great for ridged pans, or pots you've let the food sit in for to long.

"I adore the concept for this infuser bottle, it makes so much more sense to have the fruit on the bottom of the bottle versus the top. This has always been my opinion so I was excited when I saw that someone finally incorporated this concept!You can unscrew this bottle from both the top, and the bottom. I put some mint and lemon in the infuser, screwed the bottom back on and filled it up. I placed it in my fridge for about half an hour. It didn't leak anywhere, and I could already taste the slight lemon flavor.My only concern with this bottle is the top. while you are drinking from it, the cap hits your nose as shown in the picture.

"I am pretty much a walking panic attack. Racing heart, nausea, shortness of breath, etc. Sometimes it's all day, sometimes it happens with no onset at all. This supplement has helped curb that. I recommend taking the supplement to prevent anxiety versus taking it while you are having anxiety and/or panic attack.I first tried these while I felt fine, I took the recommended three in the morning. I felt fine through out the day. After about 6 hours I had an incident the stressed me out. I took my other three, and it did mellow me out. It doesn't remove the symptoms entirely, but it does help make everything more bearable. Not having a public meltdown is also a plus. It doesn't make you tired, which is a huge benefit.Additionally I took the supplement when I was on the verge of tears, for no particular reason. It took about 40 minutes to feel the effects, but it did help, and that all I can ask for. In the description, it states that it helps with racing thoughts, and feeling on the edge.

"All in all, this is a wonderful product. The bottom is a bit unsupported, however this does make it easier to push what ever you freeze inside of it out. If you fill the tray up on a counter, then place the lid on, you won't have any troubles. I tested this with water. After the lid was on securely, I could hold the tray sideways and nothing leaked out. Once frozen, the water was easy to push out from the bottom, which isn't the case in other products that I've tested.I use this tray to create frozen snacks for my chickens and goats, so I usually place heavy duty food items in it.

"I was so excited to receive these lights. I can say that we never decorate outside for the holidays. For me, it is to much effort to put in when no one will see it. This product definitely changes my outlook!Set up is simple. You screw the cord together with the attachments to make sure that it is weatherproof. Once you plug it in, it stays on for 6 hours, then shuts off automatically. The light is very heavy duty, and can easily stand up to all of the weather elements.  This is a nice feature, you literally just plug it in a forget about it!The light works best in darkness, with out street or house lights. We pointed toward our tree line, so when we look out it looks like we strung lights up in our trees. When our kids look out the window the see a cascade of blue lights that shine bright in the darkness. It creates a magical effect that we otherwise would not be able to achieve.

"This is a great starter kit of mixed oils. You can create these scents on your own, but it would cost you much more and you wouldn't have the ratios down correctly. We recently have had a bout of sickness in the house so I have been using the Breathe Easy and Health Guard scents on a washcloth at the bottom of our shower. It definitely helps open the sinuses up when mixed in with the shower steam. I keep the Mellow Mind in my purse to place a little under my nose or on my wrist when I start to get stressed out. It does have very soothing qualities in it. I've tried the Romantic Paradise and Dreamy Sleep in a diffuser, and you do have to add a lot to be able to get a nice scent going.

"I was offered the chance to review these panties at the perfect time. My husband and I have been doing the have sex for 30 days challenge. We are in the finally stretch so every little bit helps! I put these on under my jeans and loved them.I'm not a huge fan of thongs because they can get uncomfortable at times, if you know what I'm saying. These give off the same sort of feeling as wearing a thong, but they keep all the important bits covered. I love how they are so different than most other panties. The top part rest beautifully over my skin. It wasn't flimsy and did not move around and get uncomfortable through out the day. The bottom of the cut out had just enough elastically to hold the bottom part up. It wasn't droopy at all. I felt very enticing wearing them through out the day. Knowing what I was wearing and imagining my husband seeing them thrilled me, and he did love them. They showcase a lot more than the usual thong the that goes with most lingerie.I am guessing that they are not one size fits all, as most clothes aren't. I normally wear a medium, and they fit, perhaps a little loose, but not enough to cause any problems. I was given these to review for my honest opinion, which I have given.

With in an hour my phone went from 28% to 70%. That alone is five stars for me, since I have that game up constantly. It's nice to have a charger that adds battery life while I'm playing.

"In researching how to best use Jojoba oil I came across this statement from a website called vitaminstuff:""Jojoba oil is actually composed of liquid wax esters rather than oil. The body’s natural sebum also contains wax esters, which act as a sort of natural moisturizer and environmental barrier for the skin. However, wax ester production steadily decreases with age, causing the skin to appear dull and emphasizing wrinkles; a reduced ester content in the skin can also lead to the development of conditions such as psoriasis, dandruff, and rosacea. ""It's actually not an oil, which explains why it absorbs into the skin so easily. Jojoba oil is also great for those who have a lot of allergies, because it resembles the skins natural sebum. You can use this amazing oil either by itself, or mix it with your favorite essential oils. Here are a few of the ways that I have used it:*Place on the lips for an amazing moisturizer that creates soft, kissable lips. My lips felt amazing!*Use as a body lotion, it doesn't leave a greasy feeling afterwards.*Rub a couple of drops between your palms and smooth over your hair to ease frizz.*Apply after shaving for soft, smooth legs.I received this oil at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest review.

"The whistle work great. It is small and it has a ring so that you can hook it to your keychain, if that's where you prefer it. You can easily twist the end to change the pitch. When not in use, I would twist it all the way down so as not to accidentally lose it.In order to use a dog whistle, your dog has to have a grasp on basic commands. You then use the whistle after the basic commands to help your dog get used to responding at the sound of the whistle. You can then start teaching your dog new commands and using the whistle to help. This is great for any type of dog and owner.I personally have five different breeds of dogs, from tiny to large. It definitely works differently for different breeds.

Everything comes out finely ground, all of the granules similar sizes. It looks great in my kitchen, and I can easily see what spice I have in it. I received my grinder for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HCC5R28Y0IJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8GDRL6#wasThisHelpful","R3HCC5R28Y0IJD","A3JQPRIIGFWUCR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JQPRIIGFWUCR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:10 MinsI was excited to receive this folder to review. I do have to say that it was difficult to review it with out any of the accessories. The folder itself is great quality. It is made of a hard but flexible plastic. The promotional stickers peel off easily, which is always a plus. Also the plastic covers any paper that you may put in it. With the three ring binder design eliminated, it does make for a slimmer, sleeker design.I am someone who loves organizational tools, and this folder comes with an abundance of different tools that you can purchase separately. They all are placed in the binder with a unique locking system that I haven't seen before. I love all of the different options that are offered. You could use this binder to organize just about anything that you could imagine. Couponing, School work, etc. With all the different organizational options this folder is so versatile. You only have to purchase what you need, instead of buying a big binder full of stuff that you never plan on using. I received this folder for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KL248IR9Z72D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033UJ3NE#wasThisHelpful","R2KL248IR9Z72D","A3JQPRIIGFWUCR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JQPRIIGFWUCR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great InstaNatural product to add to your morning/nightly routines. I had never heard of a vitamin B serum, but I was excited to try it when I was offered it to review. The skin on my face has a bad habit of turning red for no reason. This serum is great for reversing that issue. The serum absorbs quickly into my skin, and as always with InstaNatural, it doesn't smell bad at all.There are many other benefits to this serum that I can't attest to. It can help lighten skin, and help treat acne. My skin is already so light that I can barely find a concealer to match! I also haven't had any acne problems while testing this product. (knock on wood!) If y0ou are looking to lighten you skin tone, or maybe you have some acne problems, give this a go! It might work wonders for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SIHB7OEMXYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5N0Y4U#wasThisHelpful","R24SIHB7OEMXYT","A3JQPRIIGFWUCR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JQPRIIGFWUCR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products that you never really think that you need until you try it. I received this item for review, so I had to do some research to find out what effects I would be receiving from this supplement. Honestly I was a little nervous to start taking them. What stood out to me is that if you have a high amount of stress, or take antibiotics, it can mess with your digestive track. This can lead to gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea etc. I could relate to all of that! I knew that stress could reek havoc on your body, but I never knew to what extent.I started taking one a day, and I am amazed with the results. I was never aware of how much (sorry) random gas and diarrhea I was experimenting, until these supplements put my body back in order. I recommend that everyone at east gives these a try once in their life!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6O6CPCAXNE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNTBF22#wasThisHelpful","R2S6O6CPCAXNE4","A3JQPRIIGFWUCR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JQPRIIGFWUCR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These teacup cupcakes are absolutely adorable. They are so versatile in what you can use them for as well. They are perfect to serve treats in for a tea party! You don't have to worry about them breaking, and the kids love them.They are also great for baking. They come in sets of four so they are great for making a few stunning cupcakes to include in a display with your other cupcakes. Adorable for a baby shower, bridal shower, or birthday parties. They include a plastic plate for display, but if you can find a few small patterned plate from the thrift store you've got yourself a beautiful display!These are very durable, and aren't going to be breaking or tearing on you.

"Received in exchange for a honest reviewOf all the characters in this book it was Aaron that I loved the most. I loved how he learned from the sins of his past and was trying to get beyond that. I loved that he was making an effort to become who he wants to be and not what others thought or expected of him.Melody when you begin is a little whiney. she is lost. Has lost her way in life and has lost passion. Passion in everything. As a character she shows the most growth. she goes from being whiney and self destructive to a strong take charge business woman who now has confidence in her abilities and has found someone to love and care for her. She does have some wariness when it comes to Aaron though.Aaron is not what people think. He is struggling to find his place. He loves music but doesn’t love the world of music. His desire is to sing and write and support his brother. When the story begins he fears relationships and family because he has seen what the music world does to them first hand. After he meets Melody he finds his muse and begins to change his tune on what he needs, wants and desires. They help each other resurrect their careers, become stronger more aware people and support one another. they find love when they are least expecting it and stumble at first out of fear but in the end they are great together.this is a fun no holds bar book about reinventing yourself, gaining confidence in who you are and what you can do and finding the one person who makes your days brighter and supports you. Aaron and Melody are wonderful sweet characters who with the help of each other gain the strength to see that they will make it, are better and stronger than they think and find love in each other. Aaron’s song to Melody so swoony. the romance is one based on attraction and friendship they come to respect and rely on each other. A great journey of two people finding their way in life and to each other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBRGFKKPESFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5JTW#wasThisHelpful","RZBRGFKKPESFP","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Received in exchange of a honest review.With each book of Alice Clayton’s I fall more in love with her writing style. I love the sexy jokes that drip of innuendo and this book has so much of that. I love the denial of wanting more and slowly succumbing. Alice Clayton not only has a great fun sexy book here but the beginning of a great series.With this book what I liked most was the fun snarky ways and also the jokes were awesome. But the way that Roxie slowly saw that her hometown was a great place after she ran all those years from it. I loved how she began to find a love and fondness for her home and how her perspective about small towns and herself began to change. that isn’t to say she still wasn’t a bumbler especially around Leo but she was able to overcome her awkwardness of being scared to become her old self and stay strong and still be fun, loving, caring and nice. She was able to do what she loved while being at her family diner when she thought that she would drown in the monotony. Her high school crush and his husband helped her with this as did Leo.Leo the sexy smexy guy with a passion for the land he worked but coming from a family everyone associated with money. He wasn’t what Roxie expected and she turned her world around. He made her see beyond the wanting of success and the city and to what was passionate, wild and free. She began to see a caring sweet amazing guy who gave snark as much as he could take from her. The references to Almanzo Wilder cracked me up. It added a fun light element to the book as these two explored their feelings for each other.there wasn’t a moment that clayton didn’t have you smiling and loving each character. Even the ornery dairy farmer was likeable. Each character brought a whole level of fun and element to the book. Each played a part in creating a great experience throughout the book in which you got to see them and their town for what it was. They also helped Roxie in seeing what she was afraid of and confronting those fears head on.the story between her and leo was amazeballs. The banter and the sexy moments will have you laugh and fan yourself all at once. Clayton has outdone herself again with the perfect amount of smexy, intimate moments, fun snarky banner, finding yourself and what you want and romantic moments. She has us engaged from the beginning and doesn’t let you go until the end and what a ending. We get a sneak into what is next to happen in the series and a happy ending that is sure to keep us in stitches and smiling even in the later books. I am hooked on this series and can’t wait for the next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7K1Q3TE9NZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118137#wasThisHelpful","RN7K1Q3TE9NZA","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was wonderful. such a beautiful romance. I felt for Sawyer and Luke. Sawyer because of how much he kept inside and how much he wanted to keep his family from suffering from who he was. He was so afraid people would hurt his family’s livelihood and of disappointing his family that he kept who he was from everyone. Luke because he was treated so horribly in his past that you wanted to just hug him and tell him everything would be okay.Each character gave meaning and depth to the story. The ones that added comic relief were Zach and Kendrick. those two were a hoot. They were there when Sawyer needed them and showed such love and support even if they were goofballs. Kendricks jokes were to much they had me rolling. The ones when Luke and Sawyer went to the aquarium were just to funny. That comic relief was needed with the story of these two and their journey to finding comfort in who they are and finding love with each other..Sawyer’s family were so loving and understanding. Nicky was adorable with his honesty and way of seeing things you can’t help but smile. When the ones of his family didn’t initially show support for Sawyer you felt for him but as you learned why it broke your heart. They loved him so much they didn’t want him to hurt and didn’t realize they were hurting him more. This made them turn around and the support and love was breathtaking to see.I do want a story on Hayden and Mikel because that little tidbit was one that got you wanting to know more. Luke was a wonderful guy but hurt so much. He was trying to honor his mom but not really because he wasn’t  living. He was existing. He was fighting his feelings for Sawyer because of his pain from his dad and brothers. Sawyer knew this and was sweet, kind, understanding and patient. It hurt him to see Luke this way but he gave him the space and support that was needed for him to come around and see what he wanted and desired. What that was was Sawyer. I felt so much for Sawyer for this book showed us his struggle in his teens and college to present day and how much he wanted a love like everyone in his family had. He found this with Luke but it took time. Time for Luke to see that it was okay to love Sawyer. Once Luke came to terms with this it still took awhile for Luke to accept Sawyer’s family and that he wouldn’t hurt him. He was hurt so much in his past. As they got closer and the love became stronger, Luke began to give more to Sawyer and it was a wonderful sight.When apart we saw Sawyer show his own strength and from a distance love and support Luke but also go through a scary time in which he showed resilience and great character. He showed us that hate doesn’t work against hate as violence doesn’t work against violence. He showed us that acceptance of those that have hate towards his sexuality and forgiveness for their ignorance was the best offence even when they hurt you. It shows those around you how strong, kind and compassionate you are. It shows strength of character and morals. It shows people what kind of person he is and is a good example for others to follow.This is a sweet, heartbreaking, emotionally wonderful love story of two men who struggled to come to terms with who they are and who they love. A story that depicts a beautiful love that helps one heal and the other find strength in himself to be there for the one he love no matter what. A wonderful story that keeps you wanting to see what will happen and hoping for a happy ending. I loved the story of how Luke and Sawyer found themselves and love with each other. A love that lasts forever and I look forward to reading Zach’s  and Kendrick’s stories next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R295N05ST3PXEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CTUJLM#wasThisHelpful","R295N05ST3PXEZ","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a deviation from the other books of Barbara Cutrera's we have read. Here we have a more futuristic dangerous setting with intrigue, romance, suspense and unusual things occurring.Olga I will say disappointed me I expected more from her character and not a judas. Miss June was awesome and she helped you see that goodness could come out of helping others. Jason I was mixed at first. I didn't trust him but as the book went on he became more soft and understandable. He was invaluable and I saw the kindness of who he was. Paula was sweet and I was glad her and Jason got a happy ending. Jullian just evil and so deserved all that happened to him.Buddy what a wolf in sheeps clothing. It lets us see how one tragedy can scar and change a person. He went from this kind, idealistic loving man into I am not sure what you can call him in the end. I felt sorry for Nadine for she had no idea her husband was in so much pain that he couldn't deal and kind of went nutty.Nadine poor woman. She was sweet and kind. It killed me to hear her story. She is such a strong woman who went through so much. I am so glad that Chelsea and Aric are now a part of her life.Chelsea I am mixed about. She seems to be naive and yet brilliant at the same time. We get a look at what a Traumatic Brain Injury can do but at times she was a little confusing. Her passion was wonderful and so was her kindness but her childlike actions didn't always mesh with her desires and actions. It just took a while to see her the way Aric and others did. she was a strong character with compassion and was wonderful for Aric I just had to take time to reconcile all sides of her. I love her support of Aric and how she helps him see that happiness is okay to have. That it isn't his fault what happened to his family and that he should go on living.Aric was great to me. He was lost when we first meet him. So lonely and trying to help others. He wasn't dealing with his loss or what happened to him. He found purpose and love with Chelsea and she helped him open up. It was like watching someone grow and open up before your eyes. His compassion and love for chelsea and others was amazing. His protection of Chelsea was incredible to see. He and chelsea went through so much and had so much deception and danger put on them you feel for them and hope that they get peace soon.the plot kept you on your toes as you tried to piece together Chelsea's past, why people were being killed and Alraic and his condition that kept him from dying in the D plague and gave him the unusual medical condition he was in. The mystery and how these two tie together is fascinating and intriguing. Watching them support and love each other was great.This was a intriguing book that keeps you on your toes while the characters explore who they are, how to heal and find love with each other and a family amongst themselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FAVQ105MG9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LLTTV2#wasThisHelpful","R18FAVQ105MG9Z","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"this is sensual fun and fascinating to watch unfold. We have the older woman in Kendall who was burned by someone. She worked hard and thought that it would pay off and she would get her dream of a family at the end only to get tossed aside. This left her feeling very distrusting and alone. Now she has worked her way to becoming someone and wants to settle down and have children but only with someone of similar ways. She doesn’t want to join in the dating pool and find someone so she goes online. This cuts out the getting to know if they are compatible because the site does that for you.Meantime her world is in a tailspin because of the young sweet and gorgeous Jase who wants her but due to his childhood has a set plan and doesn’t  want to deviate from it. He does though feel drawn to Kendall and wants to get to know her and become more with her.She resists him at first but he does wear her down. She sets it though so it is only friends with bennies and over time they will stop because she doesn’t want to get hurt and wants a family whereas he wants a family but not right away.As they go on this wild sexy adventure they get to know each other and see that they are alike in many ways. Not only do they get to know each other’s  bodies they fall in love. For Jase he begins to see that he wants Kendall and is starting to believe in watching his plans. For Kendall it causes her to panic because of Jase’s age and his not wanting a family right away. When they do walk away it was Kendall asking for the space and when something unexpected occurs she controls how everything will happen without giving Jase a chance to say anything.He does though. He gets her to see him and his desires and they get a great happy wonderful ending.  I like that we have two strong characters whose lives have had detours. One decides to structure their world and the other work hard and than go after their desires because they are now established. They find each other and succumb to the attraction only to have their world turned upside down and that is a good thing. they have to learn that life isn’t always structured or follows a timetable and that love comes when you least expect it.A wonderful set of characters that bring you on a sexy ride as they see what love does to their world and how it makes them better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCHNK5XXCNEKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01258E2G2#wasThisHelpful","RCHNK5XXCNEKP","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was adorable. I absolutely adore Emmett. He is a strong character that has manners, is kind and considerate. He doesn't try to harm anyone or treat anyone with disdain.Casey Peeler has given us a southern romance. A clean southern romance that has your heart go pitter patter. What makes this even better is that the romance doesn't take over the book or overwhelm you. This book is about the strength of one girl-Reagan. A girl who has been through so much. When she was younger she lost her parents and is raised by her grandfather. What stands out in this time for her is the little boy who brought her a stuffed bunny. This little boy was Emmett. This bunny has become her safety blanket like Linus has in Peanuts. It gives her comfort and lets her know that she will be okay. It also lets her know there are others that care. Over the years Reagan becomes the epitome of what every parent wants in a child. She is kind, thoughtful, smart,considerate and does as asked of her. For her though her grandfather comes before anyone or anything.When this world of hers gets a wrinkle, Emmett is there. He is back and still in love with Reagan- the little girl who stole his heart and never let it go. He doesn't try to take over her world though. He tries to find a place in it. He understands who comes first and only asks to play a role. He is there for her when she needs it and becomes her support system. He allows her to see that someone out there cares and won't walk away.The romance is slow building and sweet. Sometimes I had to look up things because I am not familiar with Southern ways or even sodas. It was good to get out of the familiar and go into the world of the south. the country where romance is sweet and life seems to slow down and not be so fast paced. A romance that is based on trust and friendship and not just attraction. Two people who give each other strength and support coming together not to take over the other's world but make it better.The family aspect shows us what family is and what family does for one another. Grandpa is awesome and he will have you laugh, cry and smile all through the book. He is one tough ole bird.A sweetly written book on family, loss, survival and love. A delightful read that keeps your heart warm and smiling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NU0YTYPFMP6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG3F32E#wasThisHelpful","R2NU0YTYPFMP6R","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The skating aspect is amazing and so real. The training, the competitiveness is just so real. You feel like you are living these characters hopes, dreams and disappointments. This is a sweet romance. They struggle to get together not because they don’t  like each other but because of their skate partners and being each other’s competition. For Josh though this isn’t a issue. He doesn’t care. He has liked Courtney for eight years. She has been his inspiration in the choreography he creates and he has waited so long to be with her. Courtney has the problem but because she is confused. Not over her feelings but over how it would work. Could they concentrate on their skating and if one loses would they be happy for the other?Each character has their own flair. The twins are cutey patooteys and how they latch to Courtney is precious. Mrs. Cappers cracks me up. Josh’s parents meh they are way to controlling. Love Courts parents though they are the right blend of supportive and loving. Em and Sergei I believe they were trying to do what was right but that doesn’  t always pan out. Stephanie, Josh’s sister, major B*. Mark is Courtney’s partner and he is intense. we don’t get much on him although you can understand his fears, wariness and intensity. This is his last chance at a medal so everything is on the line for him.All the scheming and evilness of Stephanie I am glad to see doesn’t work. She outs Josh and Courtney but that gets them stronger and closer, she is horrible to Courtney but that only makes Courtney strive for more. Josh is nothing like his sister-he’s kind, thoughtful, sweet, patient and swoony. He treats Courtney like a queen and is so shy and quiet that it isn’t  until he says anything that you believe he is liking Courtney or even going to do anything about his crush. As they get closer the relationship takes on new meaning. they now have a support system and trust each other. Unfortunately things do tear at them until Courtney sees that her heart belongs to Josh. She has to get over the sting of loss to be able to move forward. All at once her world crumbles and she is lost. This takes  time to come back from. Good thing Josh is a patient guy and loves her.the story is sweet and I love watching Josh blossom and show himself to others. I love how he gains the courage to show his feeling and intentions to Courtney. I love how it is this love that gives him the courage to stand up for himself and what he wants to do with his life. I felt bad though that his parents never really believed he could make it on his own. So glad that Courtney’s family is their to support them.This book brings you into the world of competitive skating and the competitiveness. It shows you and has you feel the hopes and dreams of those in the sport. We see love blossom, fears realized, worlds crumble but love pull them through and they come out stronger.A nice book on love and finding who you are. finding your voice and the support and love you need to help you become who you want to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1C0G8JQKXIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990434214#wasThisHelpful","RK1C0G8JQKXIH","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this book does not need Cindrella’s dress to be read and understood but by reading Cinderella’ s dress first you get a better idea and background first. You also get more depth to the characters and the parts they play. Each character has a role and has importance even if it isn’t seen at first.The building of the era and the surroundings is excellent and needed so that you can transport yourself back to this time. the descriptions and stories make you feel as if you are there living it. The history of Cinderella as we know it is upended and this viewpoint and tale is just as wonderful and beautiful.Shonna Slayton has taken a fairy tale we all know and adore. One we wish would happen to us and upends it a little. We now have the descendants taking a role but the dresses and shoes are magical. the fairy godmother is a woman named Esmerelda but known to others as something else.this adventure takes place when Kate is on her way to Italy with the Kodolenko’s and Johnny. Johnny is on his way to work with his dad for the summer, the Kodolenko’s  back home after claiming the dresses and Kate to find Cinderella’s shoes and her dad.Nessa is the next in line for the dresses and boy is she spoiled. she loses sight of what is important and begins to treat Kate as a servant. She forgets that as a princess she is to serve others and not boss them around. The dresses take over her thoughts and she lets the greed that all is warned about consume her. We do however get glimpses of the real Nessa throughout the book and at the end when she learns her lesson. Overall Nessa is a nice caring girl who gets caught up in the idea of being a princess and having something others want.In a way so does Kate, she doesn’t  get spoiled but more possessive. Her fear of not doing what is best for the dresses has her become more green. She thinks of herself as the owner instead of the keeper. It is Johnny and her adventure that has her see this. Her and Nessa are the next generation for the dress and shoes and they are to change the role this has. I hope we get to read how this happens in later books.Johnny there aren’t  enough words for him. He is swoonworthy. So loyal kind and amazing. He loves and supports Kate as she does him. He has the patience of Job for understanding about the keeper role and waiting for Kate to find her way. He is steadfast and wonderful. What lesson he learns when they are pulled into a game and left behind is that he needs to trust Kate like he asked her to trust him. This goes a long way in helping their relationship get stronger. Their belief in one another is never ending and their support of each other is infinite as is the love and respect they have for each other. He is a true Prince Charming and I want to see more of him and Kate and how their relationship builds more in later books.The story itself is unique and as said before upends the cindrella tale. We get a fun twist about the dresses and shoes and see them be used for good and hopefully find a new tale with them. The adventure through Poland is eye opening and dangerous for Kate. She has to learn to rely on Lidka. Lidka who wants to love but is afraid of losing everything again. Who is angry about the war. When Lidka realizes she was used, she shows herself to Kate and helps her out. Lidka is the complex character who shows us all what can happen when you lose everything and are afraid to show your love. She is the one who helps everyone learn lessons from their greed and want of the dresses.This is a creatively written, beautiful and alluring tale of hope, dreams and love. About finding faith in those around you and in the love you have for others. About reunions that show what it means to have love and have a fairy tale happen with a happy ending. About finding someone to love and trust and about beginning to open your heart and let someone in. A great adventure for a pair of shoes that can lead to finding a father that leads to danger and lesson learned but also finding out how much someone means to you and learning what greed can do. I hope that this series has more to come because with each book the story got more alluring and entrancing and drew you into the characters, era and tale being unfolded before you. Each book drew you into the book more and had you feel you were living in the moment and feeling what the characters were. A wonderful book and series so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU76NKZCBXUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166QEK7K#wasThisHelpful","R2JU76NKZCBXUV","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wasn’t sure what to think at first but after I began couldn’t stop. It wasn’t the erotic moments that captured me though. It was the story itself and the characters.We have two people who have fears and don’ t let anyone in. One because of feeling left behind and replaced another because of the actions of her parents. One becomes like stone and the other runs when someone wishes to get close. They live their emotions in horse showing and jumping. this is where they feel safe.I liked Grant more than Heather I will admit. Grant was tough as stone on the outside but as his feisty witchy sister said he is soft on the inside. He sees the good in people when there is good to be seen. He tries to please others so they aren’t  hurt but this has hurt him. He no longer stands up for himself that is until Heather. He trusts her and has a connection to her. She helps him find his voice again. He helps her see that she can open up and that not everyone thinks she is like her parents. Grant doesn’t care what her parents did for it isn’t who she is. this takes awhile for her to see. See that he loves her and wants her. Grant shows Heather who he is on the inside and not what she thinks he is.Heather is a stubborn, feisty but kind and compassionate woman. She has a problem letting people in. Her and her brother have shut down emotionally due to her dad’s past actions. This has left her alone and distrusting. Her world is her horse’s and trying to beat Grant in that arena. She almost settles for the doctor she works with so that she can have someone but Grant changes this. She is so afraid of making the wrong choice that she runs and allows the voices of her past that told her she was worthless and everyone would walk away to take over. Grant though sticks to her. He doesn’t  relent. He is there to support her, care for her and love her. Until she is stupid and tries to push him away.Miracles though happen and they find each other once more. Grant shows her love and compassion for he is this on the inside. He is kind and caring, patient and wise. One who is there no matter what. this is a erotic, sensual and intimate book about finding the one to open your heart and to trust. A book on finding your voice and yourself and allowing yourself to love and be loved by someone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SX7ERH0I0E47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517070074#wasThisHelpful","R3SX7ERH0I0E47","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"received in exchange for a honest review. This is a cute cute romance.Ben is this awkward guy who has a love for books and this is what he wants to get lost in-the emotions, thoughts, concepts of books. He wants to immerse himself in what they bring to him. He wants to express this love to others and have them show him what they see in the book. He wants others to see what literature can bring to them. But his family is against this. They feel this is a pipe dream. So he swallows his love and goes the path of least resistance. He crushes on the girl his parents would approve of so he can feel numb. He is a sweet, kind shy guy who just is lost. Lost in the expectations of the moments his family creates for him. Than comes the one girl who is feeling similar to him. A girl who doesn’t read but has the world opened to her by Ben showing her what books bring to the table. A girl who doesn’t want to disappoint her dad but isn’t sure if her life goal is the same anymore.  Hannah is a smart sweet girl and she is lost. Lost in the world of chemistry and wanting to change the world and follow her parents footsteps. But one day she meets a boy- a wide eyed boy who showed her a new world. A world of books and who he was. This changes her and excites her. She no longer feels the same about the world she is living in. The world where chemistry is what she wants.As they go on in the world of books they find each other. Their thoughts, feelings and beliefs. What makes them them. What they love and what they truly want and love. they become friends but deny they feel more. As the feelings grow so does their trust in one another. Ben does do some stupid things but only because of fear. Fear of losing everything. When he realizes this, he changes. He goes with his feelings. And they are good together. Their story is cute. It shows us how life expectations wear on us but when we let someone in we can find the strength to become free. Free of expectations and of what others want. We can just become who we are meant to be. Ben and Hannah find a anchor and support system with each other. they become friends and fall in love. they help each other through difficult situations with patience, kindness and love.This is a fun sweet cute story that has likeable characters who warm your heart as you read about them finding courage to stand up for their dreams and find love with each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FIWLC2VXQ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PF3OEE#wasThisHelpful","R6FIWLC2VXQ4S","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We see the Lucas who is still fighting for approval of his father. We see a Lucas trying to rise above his past and show his past that he is a survivor and better than perceived.

"Trina starts the book as a rather frigid girl who thinks she knows everything. She is schedule oriented never sways from her opinion and schedule. She feels that she is the one teaching Slade. Determined to get him fired so that she can do things her way for Slade will surely be the slacker she knows he is. She only sees one side of things and that is her side.Slade is so easy going and relaxed you wonder if he is gumby. I think he is like this because of the pressure his parents place on him. He is rebelling against them in his own way trying to show them he is a person and his own person to boot. When his parents threaten him with no allowance unless he gets a job he goes on the interview his mother setup for him for a nanny position. Little did he know his mother was being underhanded.It’ s funny because neither really saw the other as anything but thorns. Slade wanted to be her partner as a nanny and she wanted him gone. even when he helped her she thought he was being uncooperative and a bad nanny. She fought him left and right and just treated him beneath her. As she gets to see who he is she begins to like him. The barbs they have are fun and the adventures as nanny’s  they go on with the children are a hoot. the little kids they are watching are a scream. They are so cute. It is because of them that Slade and Trina truly get to know each other and see who they really are. Slade at first denies his attraction. thinking it is just because of the bet he has with his friend. but as the summer wears on he begins to see it isn’t. He changes. He becomes more responsible and stops his player ways. He is still fun loving but now he feels things and sees he likes trina.Things do begin to build and it is a joy to see. These two are so fun and sweet once they get over the hangups. They work well together as well. He is the fun and she is the rational and logical one. He is calm and collected in situations and she helps to enrich the days with educational musings.When things come to a head in their wonderful peace, I feel Trina overreacted and was a bit hypocritical. What she was doing was a lot worse than Slade’s bet. He was trying to loosen her up and get her to have fun. In the process he fell in love. She was deceiving him in a bigger way and when it came out from her accidentally exposing the secret she had she I don’t think understood the depth of the hurt to Slade. He felt as if she didn’t truly see him. that she saw him as just a job a slacker who couldn’t hack it. They both did some swoonworthy actions to get the other back.This is a fun loving sweet book about two opposites who come together. they begin to see each other differently as they work together and they change their opinions of one another. Trina changes from being so schedule oriented and thinking she knows all to letting her hair down every once in awhile and having fun. she sees him as a equal. He changes from a player to a fun loving responsible guy who only has eyes for Trina. when together we get a treat for we have fun meet rigid and sparks fly. a book of sweet love and getting to see someone for who they are on the inside and see that change within is good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSS2UEMTDCU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5KOE#wasThisHelpful","R1DSS2UEMTDCU4","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was sweet. I love Kaden’s brother Camden and I think Hillary is his mate and that would be a hysterical read. Those two are complete players and to watch them unravel would be awesome. This book is about Kaden and Annabelle (Bells for short).Bells is a sweet kind hard working woman who falls for her best friend. A friend that has secrets. A friend who is a alien. A friend who unknowingly put her in danger. Kaden is the guy who is trying not to fall for his best friend. He is smart and responsible, kind and serious. He takes on the burden of everything from those he loves. Watching him be flummoxed by his emotions was funny. His first heart beat and fighting his attraction. The one I really found sweet was the first date with Bells. That was sweet and funny because of how he planned it.these two are perfect together. They are both kind and sweet. Loving and understanding. Both protecting those they love. Kaden will give up her to keep her safe and she becomes more assertive to keep him. When they are together you can’t help but smile because they get along so well. the intimate scenes wow just a nice steamy time there. We get to see them though in more than just intimate moments. We see them as friends, confidants and lovers. We see why they belong together. We see when Bell is in danger how Kaden steps up. We see how he struggles with his secret. How he bumbles when he can’t control his feelings. How he wants to make her happy. how much he will sacrifice for her.This is a fun sweet book about how love messes you up but also makes you whole. How two people who are different are so right for one another and the fight they put in so they can be together. The writing is light hearted and fun while the romance is sweet and at times steamy","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4A42SEUCBLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5NXE#wasThisHelpful","RB4A42SEUCBLK","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was awesome. Such a fun light funny read. Lennon cracks me up. His day to get his best friend Fin to see he is gay and wants to be with him was so hysterical and cute. From the Salon to the trip to get shirts at the Disney store to the earrings and the fancy coffee was just so sweet. Lennon truly already knows he loves Fin and is comfortable with who he is now he is just trying to get Fin to see it. So he gets Fin to agree to a gay day. A day in which they do nothing but things they found on the internet to be what gay people do to see if this is them. What we get is a rip roaring sweet coming into your own romance. We see Fin slowly come around to see that Lennon is more than he thought. That they are more than friends. What they also realize is that no matter what crazy stunt they do on gay day, they are who they are and doing these things doesn’t change that. That there is no certain way that tells you are gay but it is how you feel towards someone that tells you. You don’t have to like show tunes, have a earring or wear makeup to show you you are gay but it is the love and feelings for another that tell you. For Lennon that other is Fin and for Fin he slowly sees that it is Lennon. It is the day that helps Fin become comfortable with who he is and that he truly is in love with his best friend. It is Lennon that gives him the courage to come out and be who he is.this is a book that has two very likeable sweet characters that you root to find out who they are and be comfortable with who they are. They are also characters that grow and find themselves and that they are more than friends but in love with each other. A love that comes about in the best way by having friendship first. This is a sweet, funny book about two boys who love one another and learn how to show it to each other. How they get the courage to be together and be themselves while showing their feelings for one another. this also shows that stereotypes are silly for you are who you are no matter what others think and not because of a stereotype but because of your feelings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ38523Z2TG5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013O1V2OE#wasThisHelpful","RZ38523Z2TG5Z","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was nice. Mili and her childish ways at times were grating but Ahaan was wonderful. What made this story was how we got to see the culture and their practices. Also the kindness and patience of Ahaan as Mili found her way to him.Mili is a independent girl with headstrong ways. She believes that she shouldn’t get married because it will stop her from doing what she wants. Her freedom will be gone.

"This book had some dangerous elements to it and at the end took a little bit to understand why all that happened did. To me the way that went down and the using of Uncle Jack and Sammie was all sorts of wrong. So many people got hurt for ones blind desire for revenge and to get what he wanted.Sammie and Enrique were both flawed characters. Both with insecurities that were results of past relationships. In the grand scheme of things it made them never truly invested in the hot relationship they had because they never really trusted one another. Enrique was a little more understanding on the not telling Sammie everything afterall he was undercover but still his past could have been more told to her. They did open up to each other more than to others and became each others need. Their pull towards each other was amazing. It was like moths to flame. It was always palpable in the room-from the flirting to the serious conversations you could still see that attraction and understanding of each other.Sammie overall was a good character. She had trust issues. Her worst was trusting herself. She felt if they looked the part of a bad boy than they must be and to stay away. She felt she only got attracted to bad guys. So that was where she put Enrique. This allowed her to always stay at arms length and never really trust him. She always found ways to justify this until the end. He did break those barriers but after he came to her aid and she found out the truth she was a wee bit hypocritical in her anger. I was glad that she finally gathered the courage to be with him and to do what she loved.Enrique’s trust issues come from his ex-wife and her deception. It is understandable but in the end almost costs him everything. His life, his future everything. He is overall a good guy and you see his warring with himself throughout the novel as a growth within. One that shows he does love and is conflicted. he wants to trust Sammie but is afraid to. No matter what he is there for Sammie and is good at what he does. The love he has for her shines through all his protective actions, his flirting and teasing and the intimacy and sweet romantic moments they share.The plot of the book keeps the story fresh. that added twist of a mystery as to what is going on around them and trying to solve what happened to land her uncle in jail keeps you on your toes.A book that has danger, mystery, revenge plots and love. One that shows when we let others in we grow and blossom. We find ourselves and love. A fun read that is mysterious to the end as you try to figure out who the bad guys are and why everything is happening while a sweet and sexy romance is happening between two characters who are afraid to love and trust anyone but still find each other in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0A8THSWLBY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140MQUKM#wasThisHelpful","RM0A8THSWLBY3","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy bat cave batman Knox is just he’s just wow. There aren’t many words that can truly describe the character Knox. His convictions, his thoughts, his feelings and his control is just sexy smexy all around. He has strong beliefs about things and he doesn’t hold back or hide behind them he owns them. He owns the fact that he waited for sex until he met “the one”. He owns the fact that he knew Ellie was who he knew would be his forever. No matter how much she discourage him he didn’t let up. He owned his academics and knew it was on him to succeed in his courses. He owned his playing and never made excuses for himself. He even takes responsibility when this area gets muddled and works on his team moral afterwards. Knox stands by his convictions and is proud of them as he should be. He doesn’t squirm or waffle he just says this is it and that is how it is.Ellie has had a rough start in life. Her parents treat her like a washcloth. To top this off she has only found love and acceptance from her brother. His life hasn’t been roses either with his dad always ragging on him but they had each other. Ellie did some unsavory things to help her brother out on the insistence of their mother and in the end Knox gives her the courage and strength to stand up to her brother and tell him what is going on and what he needs to do. I give him credit he did the right thing and went to his coach and although he was mad at Ellie he eventually understood and accepted responsibility for himself and his shame.Ellie is feisty at times but also sweet and trying to find herself. She is trying to find her voice. With Knox she has support and love. Love that isn’t  an obligation but just love. Love with no strings. Just acceptance and understanding. He doesn’t  want to change her just be with her. Stand beside her and buoy her when she needs it. Encourage her when that is needed as well. Knox is really a great strong character that is perfect for Ellie.The moments of comradery amongst the team is great to see. They are a family on and off the field. They have a desire to win and be the best. They support each other and no matter what have each others backs. My favorite is Hammer. He is the puppy that just wants to be there and feel welcome. His skillz in the kitchen wow. And Knox’ s twin truly has a chip on his shoulder. Once you get past that he is a great guy. I can’t wait for their stories. I have a feeling Ty will be the hardest to break when it comes to love. Knox wasn’t but he always knew what he wanted and was clear about that. He was so comfortable with himself and his choices it was wonderful to see.Knox and Ellie together were just great. They complemented each other. I loved their intimate moments of talking and supporting one another even more than the physical intimate moments because it showed they were connected in more than just a physical way. The struggle at the end for Ellie to protect Knox and hurt him to keep him safe was hard for me and Knox’s  reactions was the first time I was frustrated with him. although his swoon moment at the end truly magnificent.This is a wonderful fun smexy read. Knox truly gives us a book boyfriend to be proud of. A book of acceptance and love. Finding love that is unconditional and supportive. A book of owning your actions and finding your voice. . the first meeting between Knox and Ellie will have you smile and you don’t lose that smile throughout the whole book. And the party scene you will need something to cool you off. Wowza. A book that once you start you can’t put down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NTQ3KZGLIW1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K7YSHO#wasThisHelpful","R1NTQ3KZGLIW1V","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First you don’t need the first book in the series to read this one but it may help understand why Toby was recruited. This is a interesting unique story that is great for Halloween time to read. Toby is trying to get over what happened to him but also find his purpose in life. He wants to help people unfortunately his friend’s  words keep haunting him. When the hunters come to recruit him he feels that this is right for him.I feel Toby is a strong character. His strength comes from within and wanting to help others. His eagerness comes from the guilt he has over what happened with his friends and his desire to do good. He is a good guy and he works hard but like all teens is antsy to move forward to do more. He wants so bad to help others he sometimes forgets the forest beyond the trees. when he is sent on a mission is when all chaos breaks out. And wow what action and twists we get. The end twist for Toby was really fascinating. I mean who knew that could happen?Natalie kind of rubbed me wrong at first. She seemed to be a generally good person but to much of her wanted to please others and gain the attention of one. Which okay teens are like that. We get our crushes and want them to see us but for Natalie she does things that can harm others and herself. Her actions do have consequences and when she uses her powers to help a friend and the friend feels that what she has planned isn’t  enough and changes that all heck breaks loose in her town. This is when toby and his friends arrive in town.The action is nonstop and wonderfully written. You never catch a breath once we get into Natalie’s town. It is one dangerous moment after another. Toby thinking outside the box to solve the problem is great. We see Toby’s friends once again as well and one of them turns out to be pivotal in helping solve the problem at hand. The warlock involved is pure evil. I think though it is his addiction that drives him more than anything. when they foil his intentions time and time again you just smile and hope they find a way to stop him.Overall this is a good fast paced book with lots of action and danger. Toby finds his calling and is good at what he does. Natalie finds out what she wishes to do as well but is left with guilt. I hope that gets resolved but I think like Toby it will drive her to be better. I look forward to the next adventure for Toby and seeing how he deals with his latest developments. A wonderful read that had me not wanting to put it down for I didn’t  want to miss what would happen next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMAJJJX9N1HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FR30NOI#wasThisHelpful","R2PMAJJJX9N1HH","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun and new twist to the demon story. Here the demon is sweet and kind and tries to get people out of their contracts. He is a demon with a conscience and heart. Corporate South can’t take that away when they wipe his mind. Zavier is a sweet kind demon who tries to do the right thing and in the process gets in trouble with the bosses of Corporate South. Leland the head hancho does all he can to a point to protect him due to his contract in the past. When you meet Leland at first you don’t really like him to much but what he does for Zavier and Ryan swoony and his smoldering looks to Adrian wow. Adrian is Zavier’s best friend and from Corporate North (angel). He is so sweet and his interactions with Zavier are light and fun. He helps Zavier with people’s contracts and with Zavier and Ryan finally coming together and getting a chance to get their HEA.Zavier doesn’t remember his past until Ryan comes Ryan a preciously wonderful strong and stubborn human who is willing to sacrifice himself so his niece can have her mother in her life. This touches Zavier and when they seal the deal the electricity between the two is through the roof. Zavier sees Ryan from the past. Ryan feels a sensation of familiarity and feels something for Zavier. Ryan though is skeptical of the supernatural so as Zavier doggedly comes to him with a explanation for their attraction and tension between them Ryan is hesitant to believe even when he has some pretty steamy flashbacks. It is Ryan’s best friend Jason who helps Ryan to accept Zavier’s explanation. Jason I want with Adrian if it can’t be Leland with him. I think Leland and Adrian’s story would be one sexy steamy one. Anywhoo Zavier and Ryan must learn each other again. This book has them seeing who each other is. Zavier has a harder time than Ryan because he has the memories. Ryan is frustrated because Zavier sometimes only sees the Ryan of old and not the strong, independent Ryan in front of him.There are some hysterical points in the book. The spoof of the cell phone and how hell and heaven are not corporations that have management and rules is too funny. The book has a light hearted feel to it as they deal with fighting to save loved ones and fighting for love. Ryan proves to be a very strong and amazing guy as he not only sacrifices for his sister but fights for a chance at love with Zavier. Zavier is a sweet demon who sacrifices for his love for Ryan.A fun sweet book about two men who are willing to sacrifice for those they love and fight for a love that has spanned over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29WPVDC1H5J5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147D7CMY#wasThisHelpful","R29WPVDC1H5J5T","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On the fence. I loved reading the story of Kadeem and Siriya and think Kadeem is so great. Niles and how he changes when he meets the woman who he likes that is Shiray’s cousin is sweet. Bryan is as wonderful as always. Shiray had a wee issue with. She does the gambit of emotions and her feelings about the king in the end although anger is justified she doesn’t even try to see things through his eyes. His family means more to him that anything else in the world and he would do whatever is necessary to save them and keep them from harm. She needed to see this but doesn’t. Siriya at times was unreasonable as well. I think for these two strong woman they need to learn to see things from different perspectives and even if they do not believe in what someone did or thinks doesn’t mean you don’t respect their thoughts and enter into a discussion.If you haven’t read the first book it is okay, this book does do flashbacks and catches you up to speed. Kadeem for me is the one character that is redeeming. He has given up his whole world for his love of Siriya. His beliefs that do not meet his father’s and how he goes about helping to stop him is admirable. He is kind and patient and deals with Siriya’s moods wonderfully. He puts so much on the line to be with her. Their son sounds precious and I think needs to be protected more than ever with his powers that he has.The plot line picks up in the end and shows us that there is some major trouble coming. Some change of the future is needed or we will see some major tragedy in the last book and I hope that the future that is seen doesn’t occur. In this book our plot is about Kadeem and Siriya and how they met and fell in love. After this we have the war and the anger of Shiray towards the King. We have the King’s guilt and desire for peace. We also have the ongoing fighting and trying to save people from Kadeem’s father. This is a interesting book because we have it from the viewpoints of Shiray and Siriya but the epilogues are told through Kadeem’s eyes. To me I would like more of Kadeem and Bryan’s thoughts and maybe Niles as well.The thoughts of Shiray and Siriya give us insight into how they see the war going, how they feel about their relationships and what is going on around them and is interesting to see. Some of Shiray’s jelaousy and fears are understandable but questionable as well. Some of the actions of Siriya you wonder about and think that she needs to grow up more and she does with the help of Kadeem.I am not feeling to good on the future aspect and that puts me on the fence. I think that the future seen is a little too much. Sure it gets you antsy and hoping that they can find a way to fix it but it also leaves you wondering why such a future. It ratchets up the danger that is already seen in this war but it also has you feeling uneasy and trying to decide if want to continue and if you can handle seeing that kind of outcome. It puts you in the middle for you want to continue on so you can see the outcome but not wanting to because the future seen is really alot to take in and sad and tragic. Other than this it was a wonderful read. You get to see the romance of Kadeem and Siriya and Bryan and Shiray grow closer. We see Niles fall for someone and change his arrogant ways a little. We see the king and how he is dealing with the war and the guilt he carries. a fast paced interesting tale that has you wondering what the future for these royals will bring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1926V1I3KFG26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KSGID4#wasThisHelpful","R1926V1I3KFG26","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"wow just wow. This is a fascinating insight into Lindsay love and her daughter.first the writing is wonderful and the story is truly intriguing. You are kept in the story wondering what is going to happen next throughout the whole book.when you first meet Lindsay Love in the other books of this series you think she is scrappy, opinionated, and loves her family. That she is wonderful and her love for her husband is immense. This book gives us the behind the scenes to Lindsay and her family.the first part is about Lindsay and how she becomes Anton’s wife and their struggles. Through it all you see the love of Anton shine through. I felt for the guy I mean she was a spoiled young woman who was stubborn and short tempered. Not only that she was very cruel when she wanted to be. She didn’t think of the consequences and lashed out so others could feel her wrath or pain. I truly think Anton in the beginning in some way knew her reasons for marrying him but thought that his love would win her over. Who knew she was so empty and hollow inside. What she did when pregnant with Dominic was just wrong and cruel. Her desire for everyone to cow to her and her to always be right was just to much and seriously her thoughts about her pregnancy wow. So wrong. Than we have her lashing out at Anton about money and saying some horrible things. When he acts on this despair and doesn’t mean to she goes off the rails to get back at him but she goes further. Than she hides it. She feels he was in the wrong and justifies it. Although she feels guilty and when later on in years this comes back to bite her she can’t understand the issue. And after her daughter is born how she acts is just wrong. That girl felt unloved and as a burden. Her two children that were hurt by her actions were Dominic and Angelique.the second part tells us about Angelique and her return to the family. How she felt her mom hated her and how messed up this made her. She felt unworthy of love and ran from happiness. As we read her journey into finding acceptance and love and seeing that family is important you feel sad for her. She only felt worthy from her father. A man who at one point just felt defeated until tragedy almost strikes this family and brings them all together to see what matters most and that is love, forgiveness and family.A wonderfully insightful book into the two women of this family and what family is. About unconditional love and the bonds that love forms. About being there for each other no matter what and finding your way. You will love Anton and the boys, have alot of shock from the actions of Lindsay and see the side you didn’t know existed and feel sad for Angelique. A book on family and what family means and what love is there from family. the love and support a family gives and how they are there for each other. This book shows us what that means in a unique way and we see the good, bad and ugly of it all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTSSR72OF3SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQXIY7I#wasThisHelpful","R3MTSSR72OF3SC","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book will bring you through so many emotions. It is powerful, thought provoking and poignant. Most importantly it is very realistic as to what can happen to one when they come to terms with who they are and what happens when they get the courage to tell their loved ones.ryan comes full circle in this book. We see flashbacks as he is trying to let go of his past and find a way to forgive. This young man went through so much struggle as he comes to terms with who he is and who he loves. He finds great supportive friends along the way but the journey to finding love and loving freely was a rough one.We see Ryan struggle with his sexuality. He is so afraid of his parents and them not loving him anymore that in a way he goes into denial. when he finally does face it in a miniscule way he sees his parents reaction and hides again. Once this happens he does everything to be what they want and push down who he really is. Such a sad time for Ryan although he does gain some amazing friends and wisdom he becomes a shell of himself as well. When reality finally hits Ryan he decides to try to live the way he wishes. This only can go so far though for he is still hiding. When he gets tired of the lies he moves again and opens himself up and finds happiness. that is until his world collides with reality of family.when he gets the courage to come out the reaction is so heartbreaking. His brother and sister though are amazing. At the same time this occurs his life spirals downward even further. Ryan goes exploring from her to truly find himself and peace. Upon doing this he meets the man who grounds him and finds love that is unconditional. It is his love for Jean and Jean’s encouragement that helps him face his past and come to peace with it.We see a reflective and angry Ryan trying so hard to find forgiveness within for those that hurt him the most so that he can move forward and not harbor any anger. This is such a poignant place for ryan and the writing of his story and struggle to find himself and be comfortable with who he is and find love that you will be overwhelmed with emotion and the beauty of the story. The ending is so sweet.Each character and timeframe you see plays a important role in Ryan’s life and decisions. they are all in some way catalysts in his world. The book is beautiful and poignant and a pretty realistic look at one trying to find himself, finding the courage to be who they are only to be treated disgracefully and coming full circle once they are at peace with themselves and find love to be able to confront the past and move on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M8FYY59ZDXP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFTEEMI#wasThisHelpful","R3M8FYY59ZDXP2","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That animals aren’t bad and they can be friends. Upon meeting Jenny is when we get our surprise. What a surprise! This will get the kiddos excited for the next book as I know I am.A great book all year round for its delightful story with witches, talking animals and two little girls who are opposites in all ways but have a common thread to them they want to be good and do things well. So wonderfully written to capture the imagination and keep you entertained as well. This is also a great book for Halloween for the kiddos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QOG6DTRB8OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FO564W#wasThisHelpful","R13QOG6DTRB8OW","A956O72VO20Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A956O72VO20Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I shoulda known something was up when the dog meowed at me.As so begins a simple little tale that's more Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside than what you might expect from the Bizarro genre. Yes, Muscle Memory is fun, twisted, and just a tad perverse, but it's also a thoughtful, deeply reflective tale from the pen of Steve Lowe.It starts off on a suitably surreal note, with a body swap discovered in bits and pieces, the clues slowly assaulting an already suffering mind. Billy has woken up in the body of his wife, Tina, a new mother suffering from postpartum depression and a strained marriage. The fact that it takes the intervention of his body-swapped neighbors to make him aware of those facts is sad, but the eventual discovery of why his wife lies dead upon their bed, trapped inside his body, is absolutely tragic.There are most definitely patented moments of Bizarro humor here - Tucker's far-too-long bathroom break of self-exploration, the neighbor who has seemingly confirmed everyone's suspicions by waking up as one of his sheep, and the odd afternoon of drinking among familiar friends in unfamiliar faces at the bar - but they're not the focus. For much of the story, Lowe leads along in search for answers as to how/why it all happened, but that's not the focus either. Ultimately Muscle Memory is a story about what Billy did to deserve it . . . and what he'll take away from the experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2DVCWZCLXLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TGTFAC#wasThisHelpful","R3P2DVCWZCLXLJ","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to a great read (as opposed to a good one), timing can be everything. I tend to be a somewhat moody reader, and there are times where I'll put something aside until I feel like I'm in the right mood for it. Such was the case with The Fifth House of the Heart. I started in on it back in July, and it just wasn't working for me, but gave it another shot last week . . . and was completely blown away.Forget what you know about vampires or the urban fantasy genre, because Ben Tripp isn't interested in covering the tropes or playing to your expectations. This is a fiercely original horror-themed adventure that doesn't make the mistake of feeling like a deliberate attempt to subvert the genre. Instead, it comes across as a natural, fun sort of evolution of the original concept, one that rides the crimson wave of the character personalities.From beginning to end, The Fifth House of the Heart is just a perfect novel that adeptly blends genres and mythologies. It's guaranteed not to be the novel you expect, and that's a big part of its charm. It's terrifying, humorous, adventurous, and charming, but most of all it's entertaining. Allow Sax to draw you into his tale, chuckle and gasp alongside him, and be sure to thank Tripp for the introduction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URIHPS48D2KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476782636#wasThisHelpful","R2URIHPS48D2KU","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fool's Quest is an absolutely brilliant book that works perfectly on all levels. It takes the story that was introduced in the first volume, builds upon it, develops it, and sheds new light on what has gone before. More than that, it's also takes the story that was told in the first two trilogies and develops it in some surprising (but welcome) directions. I won't spoil the moment by providing any sort of context, but if you aren't overcome with emotion when Fitz says ""The roar of acclaim broke over me like a wave,"" then you haven't been paying attention to the sacrifices he's made throughout the series.I complained that the first book felt like an extended prologue of over 500 pages (followed by an opening chapter of about 80), but the story here returns to the pace we're accustomed to with Hobb. That's so say that there are still prolonged long lulls, filled with a lot of talk and a great deal of self-doubt and introspection, but there are also significant moments of action throughout. Things happen here, pushing the story forward, and bringing our characters together. Some of those scenes are small and intimate, while others are more sweeping, but they all work. This is a book that I found myself excited about, from beginning to end, never once lamenting those lulls to build character or reveal the truth behind schemes and actions. It was glorious to properly return to Buckkeep, but I also enjoyed our visits back to Withywoods. More than all that, though, I enjoyed our trips through the Stones the most, especially as they take us to some surprising (and nostalgic) places in the concluding chapters.Fool's Quest isn't just a return to form for Fitz, Chade, and the Fool, it's a return to form for Hobb herself. This is precisely the kind of novel we were all expecting from the opening chapter of The Fitz and The Fool Trilogy, and it has me ridiculously anxious to read the next. The pacing is perfect, the characters ring true, and the world building continues in some delightfully surprising ways. There's a lot of intimate, personal conflict here, and I really wondered how she would resolve it all, but the final chapters are some of the most satisfying she's ever written - and that includes the agonizing cliffhanger we've come to expect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYT5C787XXWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392921#wasThisHelpful","R1KYT5C787XXWR","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although not quite as much fun as last year's The Lost Level, there's no doubt that King of the Bastards is firmly rooted in the same fondness for the pulp era of the early 20th century. Brian Keene & Steven L. Shrewsbury have crafted a tale that almost feels like an posthumous collaboration between Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, and Michael Moorcock.This is, for better and for worse, a complete throwback novella. It's pure pulp, full of clichés, and heavily dependent upon genre tropes. There's nothing truly original or progressive about it, but that's fine. You know what you're expecting when you pick it up, and that's precisely what you get.Our hero, Rogan, is the self-proclaimed King of the Bastards. He is a sexist, racist, misogynistic Conan clone - but with an intriguing difference. Rogan is a barbarian past his prime, a man who has turned his back on the throne to adventure through his post-retirement years. He can still slay the monsters and seduce the ladies, but he tires a bit more quickly, and his patience isn't what it used to be. This is Rogan's story to tell, and it works largely because he does explore such an interesting (and entertaining) facet of the pulp hero.Rogan and his nephew lead us from the depths of the sea, with its pirate crews and tentacled monsters; to the wilds of the jungle, with its savage natives and undead beasts; to the heights of the hazy mountain, with its sorceror gods and mutated giants. There's a bit of a sci-fi twist towards the end, but fans of the genre will likely spot it coming from miles away. All told, King of the Bastards is a fast-paced tale that doesn't attempt to do anything more than entertain, and which does so with pulpy goodness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQKF2UNHB4XI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937009327#wasThisHelpful","RHQKF2UNHB4XI","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shattered Sands distinguished itself for me from the first page. What could have been a fairly standard negotiation about slaves is turned into an intriguing bit of character establishment with a clever young woman and the stuttering Vizier who owns her. There’s so much personality in the first few scenes, that the shock of discovering he is just 19 years old really works. Similarly, our back-alley introduction to Sabra, where roles are reversed and she must fend off the advances of a male prostitute with her hidden knife, is as intriguing as it is deliberately unsettling. Saraband immediately tops that, however, barely allowing her to find solace in her home full of “holes and fissures” before engulfing it in green flames and nailing her alchemist father to the wall in a pentagram position.The world-building here is solid, especially in terms of establishing a culture, its traditions, and its rules. What we have here is a very Middle Eastern sort of world, complete with bazaars and brothels, as well as palaces and palanquins. It’s a cruel world, one where public appearances mean everything, and one where political posturing extends from the amphitheatre of College to the intimacy of the bedroom. The history of the world is revealed in dribs and drabs, through conversations and idle thoughts. It definitely has the feel of a desert culture, but that's where the comparisons to the Middle East end - the politics and religions here are Saraband's own.There’s no info dumping here, just a lot of assumptions on the author's part that we’ll pay attention and learn as we go. For instance, it isn’t until we’re halfway through that we learn of the thousand-year-old Rattling War, so called because of the sound made by the skeletons marching, but it proves to be a pivotal revelation of magic’s true power. As such, when we witness Sabra’s momentous encounter with a Djinn, complete with deadly scorpions and murderous magic, it’s less of a shock and more of a welcome revelation. If there’s any drawback to Shattered Sands it’s that the story is so ugly, so violent, and so cruel. There’s not a lot of light or happiness to be found here, and very little humour to balance out the drama. It makes for rather heavy reading at times, and may challenge some readers, but the storytelling, the characters, and the imagination of it all kept me reading through to the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY418T1KLSAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013M2CQ5O#wasThisHelpful","RGY418T1KLSAF","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This turned out to be a very different novel than I expected, and I liked that. After all, the whole idea of using androids to explore issues of identity, emotions, slavery, and more has been done to death by this point. Whether you take the Star Trek approach or the Twilight Zone approach, readers come into such stories with an expectation as to where they're going to be led. Dragon does explore those themes, but it's the twists and additional layers to his story that make it compelling.While I wish he'd been developed differently, there's no question that the story works so well because Brad is such an unlikable, unsympathetic character. He's not a pervert, a scene-chewing villain, or a selfish monster, just a lonely man who doesn't always make the best choices. By contrast, Tricia looks and feels far more human, and it's her role in the story - alongside that of Priscilla, the 'real' woman - that carries us along despite Brad's weaknesses.What ultimately makes the story work, however, is the twist around the halfway mark when both women disappear from his life. How and why is a mystery central to the tale, with the resolution a genuinely rewarding surprise, ultimately making this more than 'just' a novel about robots, feelings, and humanity. It could have benefited from more tech-speak, to explain and ground the sci-fi aspect, but that's a personal curiosity, and not a commentary on the plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EE3SZ5BUNHQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQUS36K#wasThisHelpful","R2EE3SZ5BUNHQJ","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More historical than epic, this is a heroic Roman fantasy, updated and re-imagined with a few more fantastical details than even the classic myths have to offer. It's a violently sophisticated sort of story, full more of political backstabbing and familial responsibilities than heroic deeds. Primus Seneca is a fitting protagonist, giving us a glimpse into the very unglamorous world of ancient Rome. He's not very heroic - in fact, he's rather dull and boring - but he does take responsibility for his place in a tedious, yet challenging, situation.As introductions go, I certainly enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I'd be inclined to continue with the series. There's a spark or a sense of flair that's missing here, that little bit of stylistic oomph that catches your attention and compels you to keep reading. It's a serviceable enough narrative, but it often feels flat and matter-of-fact, without any real sense of excitement. I do wonder where it's going, but not so much that I'm eager for a sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3DLQVE3J6N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBFP1LG#wasThisHelpful","R2C3DLQVE3J6N5","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An all-round solid read, this was paced well, with great characters, an intriguing world, and a plot that flowed naturally from the opening scenes. I did put it down a few times, before coming back to enjoy the read, so I feel compelled to caution new readers that it's not the classic sword-and-sorcery adventure you're expecting. It's far deeper, more philosophical, and more focused on character interactions than grand quests or epic battles.Fortunately, our pair of mismatched heroes are a novel twist, including a retired soldier and his dragon. Before you cringe and start wondering how long before the novelty wears off, Hallowell establishes the characters, builds a bond, and makes them just as compelling as any warrior/sorcerer or barbarian/thief duo. Delno is a fantastic character, a hero who is more than capable of carrying a story, while Geneva is a character with far more personality than you'd expect in a dragon.If I were to have any complaints, it's that the dialogue is a bit stilted and awkward at times, and that the actual plot development is more subtle than significant. It's a story that needs to be read closely, at a leisurely pace, in order to be properly appreciated. I don't always have that kind of patience, but in this instance it worked.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251GZQ4B0SAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OT9IKO#wasThisHelpful","R251GZQ4B0SAM","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Scraping noises filled his ears. Nail on bone. He knew it was the creature’s claws raking against the inside of his wife’s skull, cleaning it out and wanting every last morsel...""If passages like that turn your face green and make you want to drop the book like it's covered in goblin slime, then you're likely not the right audience for this. If, however, such details make you hungry for more, then David Bernstein has put together a damn fine meal for you to enjoy with Goblins.History buffs and mystery buffs will remember the story of the Lost Roanoke Colony very well. In 1590, just 3 years after arriving on the island, the entire colony of 115 settlers disappeared without a trace. The only clues left behind were the words Croatoan carved into a gatepost, and Cro carved into a tree. Popular theories blame it on either disease or natural disaster, but Bernstein has a better explanation.Goblins. More specifically, the legendary Goblin King himself.This is a fun read with a great blend of supernatural horror and very human sorrow. Bernstein is a man who knows how to get under the skin and pull on the readers emotional strings, especially when dealing with children. We can all imagine the pain a family must endure when a child goes missing, but we can't even begin got imagine the horror of seeing that child come back . . . changed . . . and interested only in tearing you to pieces and devouring your flesh. I loved the way the kids sort of rippled, allowing their parents to glimpse the goblin beneath, just before confusion gives way to terror.Lest you think I've spoiled the entire novel, that's really just the set-up. While Bernstein could have settled for a creepy, unexplained monster tale, he instead delves deep to the history of the island and the mythology of the Goblin King to create something deeper. There's almost an urban fantasy feel to this, in terms of how/why the town has come under siege once again, and there's are a few very real-life sort of tragedies involving children that haunt the main characters, but all of that is draped in the bloody, slime-encrusted, rotten flesh-curtains of pure horror.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116IKFIOG6CQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE20334#wasThisHelpful","R116IKFIOG6CQS","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to find a Koontz book I could enjoy again, and a classic haunted house tale - with no room for one of those simplistic villains - seemed like a perfect choice.This actually started off extraordinarily well, raising my hopes for a return to form. It was mysterious and creepy, full of WTF moments, and had an intriguing ghost story at its heart. The Pendleton was a fantastic setting, and its horrific history was perfect background for a contemporary ghost story. The plummeting elevator? Awesome. The blood-red water and sinuous shapes in the basement pool? Fantastic. The gigantic bug-like creatures seen only in shadow? Stunning.Except, of course, that's not what this is. Koontz teases us for a long time, and really lays the supernatural evidence on thick, but eventually devolves into a messy sci-fi/horror mash-up involving time travel, alternate timelines, and dangerous experiments. I was disappointed, and came to resent the sci-fi intrusions, but was still willing to see where it went.Unfortunately, the characters bring the story crashing down. For one, there are just too many of them for us to really be able to focus and care about their fates. The best of them are damaged, and the worst of them are those cartoon evil-doers who deserve their fate. There are no sainted doggies here, but two special needs kids who you just know are going to be pivotal. What began as a fascinating ghost story with some real narrative flair turned into a soap opera of character studies. We go from room to room in the Pendleton, from character to character, and basically wait for something to happen. I gave up somewhere in the second half when I looked back at the past 150 pages and realized a few characters made it down the stairs. Seriously, that was the sum total of plot development. All momentum was lost, and I just couldn't compel myself to continue.I hate to say it, but I think I may be done trying to reconnect with my glory years. There are some authors who grow and evolve alongside you, and others who choose to take their development down a different path. Koontz and I, we're clearly on different paths, and I no longer see a crossroads ahead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0NGCC4TCHGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553593064#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0NGCC4TCHGB","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like its predecessor, No Return, the second novel of Jeroun follows two converging story lines - the first featuring the triumvirate of Vedas, Churls, and Berun, and the second featuring the scientist/magician Pol. It's a narrative format that echoes the first novel quite nicely, creating a natural flow or connection between the two, but that's really where the similarities end.As hard as it may be to believe, Shower of Stones is a darker, more complex, more philosophical novel. Zachary Jernigan really takes us beneath the surface of that first narrative to confront what it means to be human, to be in love, and to hold onto hope for a better tomorrow. That's not to say that this is a shiny, happy, hopeful fantasy - far from it! - but we're climbing towards the possibility of a future, rather than towards an end.The opening chapter or arc of a novel really serves to set the tone for what comes after, and Jernigan sucked me in immediately. He takes us deep into the history of the world of Jeroun, to a time before Adrash was the only god in the sky, and fully fleshes out a mythology that was only hinted at in the first book. We meet the gods (demigods?) whom Adrash created to keep him company and to provide a sense of a family, and witness firsthand as his depression and his madness drive them to wage war upon a world and attempt to drive him from the skies. It's a fractured, damaged, incestuous family dynamic that evokes memories of Greek mythology, but which is something entirely new and exciting.In the second arc, he takes us deeper into the heroes of the first book, revealing the heart and soul of Vedas, Churls, and even Berun. Whereas No Return was largely a story of mistrust and animosity, Shower of Stones is one of trust and friendship. The seeds of character development planted in the first book are allowed to take root and blossom here, driven in large part by a mysterious new character who announces himself by arriving on the back of a dragon. I won't say much about him, as his secrets are a cornerstone of the book, but I do have to say a few words about Fyra. As much as I liked the mystery and the cryptic nature of her presence in the first book, I was excited to see her become a character here, extending the heroic triumvirate into a quartet. This arc is certainly the longest of the novel, eating up far more pages than (on the surface) seems wise, but somehow Jernigan makes it work. It's a long period of talking and philosophizing, without a lot of action, but the internal conflicts really work to expose the significance of the first arc, and to bring the two of them together.The final arc involves, of course, the final confrontation with Adrash. Again, there's not much I can say here without spoiling things, but I was pleasantly surprised by how it all played out. I thought I knew where Jernigan was taking the story, but he weaves in some twists and turns that keep you guessing right to the end. Anybody getting a bit antsy over the lack of action in the second arc is well rewarded here, as everything comes together, with gods and heroes carving out a new mythology. What's refreshing, however, is that he doesn't allow the mythology to overwhelm the human element, and doesn't allow the war between gods to push the heroes to the background. It's a delicate balance when dealing with such very different forces, but I loved the way everything intertwined and came together.Shower of Stones is a very different book from No Return, both in terms of content and pacing, but somehow it all works. It's not as edgy or innovative as the first, but it's deeper, more well-rounded, and more . . . well, significant is the only word that comes to mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227AQZTTFUHGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597808172#wasThisHelpful","R227AQZTTFUHGO","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Derek Hawthorne and Shannon O’Reilly are agents of the Red Room, an ultra-secret spy agency dedicated to keeping the world in the dark about the danger (and the power) of the supernatural. Part of a global conspiracy called the House (who make the Illuminati look entirely trivial), the Red Room is kind of a combination of Torchwood and S.H.I.E.L.D., while Derek is equal parts Jack Bauer and James Bond.As a result, much of Esoterrorism will seem familiar to genre fans, but it's mythology of the House and the strength of the characters that serve to distinguish C.T. Phipps from those influences. This is a fun, action-packed book with just as much blood and gore as sarcasm and sexual innuendo.The House is an organization with truly terrifying implications. It has existed since the days of Babylon, under the cover of the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, Project Blue Book, and even the FBI’s Domestic Terrorism Division. It's a family organization, one into which you are either born, or which your entire family joins with you. At its head is a secret, elite Committee that manages and manipulates those family connections to a deplorable degree as part of its internal conspiracy. As for their impact upon the outside world, as Derek learns at one point, they don't control the world, they just ""control the people who control the world.""Derek is your typical roguish hero who refuses to play by the rules. He's a good guy who understands the importance of protecting the world, but who questions the need to keep it ignorant. Shannon is his latest partner, a woman who has been assigned to him for complicated reasons, and who has equally complicated motives behind her allegiances. Phipps imbues them with the usual sarcastic banter and sexual tension you'd expect from the genre, but (thankfully) doesn't hinge the story on that tired old trope. They're supported by a diverse cast of characters, most notably Derek's sister (a fellow agent and witch) and her girlfriend (their gadget-loving 'Q'), who add a whole other layer of sarcasm and sexual tension.There's a lot going on here, which serves to keep the story moving forward. There are complicated family dynamics, global conspiracies, questionable motives, traitors, and terrorists. There are serious questions as to whether the end can ever truly justify the means, and some interesting discussions about faith and belief. Phipps works hard to keep readers on their toes, teasing a question of loyalty throughout, and using it to feed a number of twists and turns in the plot. It's a fast-paced novel that accomplishes a lot of a very short time frame, but there's still substantial character development that bodes well for future installments.Esoterrorism is a testosterone fueled urban fantasy, the perfect novel for fans of who are tired of the paranormal romance trope, and who want to see more of the action and adventure element. It's big, it's frantic, it's violent, and it's very often funny as well. Hopefully Derek and Shannon will be back for further adventures, as we've just scratched the surface of this new world and its mythologies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV7OI45FRYP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0110HOKV6#wasThisHelpful","R2MV7OI45FRYP2","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part urban fantasy and part apocalyptic horror, with a healthy dose of dark eroticism mixed in, One, Two, Three Kiss is a unique sort of serialized novel. It starts out oddly, with the submission of a research report to International Dimension Investigations, and intersperses the narrative chapters with a follow-up interrogation, but it all works. It lends the story a ring of found-footage truth, and as much as I've tired of that genre on the screen, on the page it can still work very well - as E.J. Kimelman demonstrates here.As a dangerous new drug consumes the city, turning junkies into a monstrous mash of vampire and zombie, Darling Price continues to search for her best friend. It's not just the need to find a friend or even to solve a mystery - there's something deeper and darker to her obsession. She hungers for her best friend, and that's just the beginning. As the three stories go on, and Darline learns more about who she is and what's happening to the world, the story gets both weirder and more compelling.It's a hard story to talk about without spoiling things, since Darlene's evolution is really at the core of the story, but there's a lot here to like. We've got vampires and zombies, shapeshifters, immortals, and even witches and warlocks. I've gotten rather tired of the whole zombie craze, and sick of the romantic vampire movement, but Kimelman injects new blood (and other bodily fluids) into both. This is a story about becoming ""the most powerful being in the universe, stronger than any God, more magical than any witch or warlock, more eternal than any vampire"" and stopping ""the zombies not just in their domination of the universe but in time and space."" It sounds epic and trippy, but she really pulls it off.As for the erotic element, I was curious how it play into it all, and really worried it'd just be another sexy vampire tale, but she balances it well, using the sexuality to both contrast the violence and illustrate the more seductive extremes of power. It must be noted that One, Two, Three Kiss is waiting for a fourth kiss, and ends on a cliffhanger, but that's what serialized novels do - make you desperate for the next chapter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33J5UEA24U9BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4DJIQ8#wasThisHelpful","R33J5UEA24U9BD","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If it weren’t for the pacing issues and the one-dimensional characters, Pulse could be a blockbuster political/techno-thriller, putting Robert Cook’s name up there alongside Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, and Dale Brown.Unfortunately, the characters are so perfect that they’re propelled far beyond the bounds of credibility and into the region of ridiculous. Yes, it’s a nice change of pace from the psychologically damaged techno-thriller hero, haunted by his past, but characters need some soft spots and weaknesses the make them human. It doesn’t help that their dialogue is just as perfect. It’s like listening to a scripted documentary where every sentence is smart, direct, and precisely worded, but there’s no emotion or humanity to make the conversations seem natural.As for the pacing I mentioned earlier, I’m certainly no stranger to these novels taking their time in getting to the ‘big’ event, but you need a few small events along the way to build the tension. When war does finally come to the world in the last 100 or so pages, it’s certainly a high point of the novel, extremely well-written and wonderfully detailed, but almost too little, too late. Having said all that, this is the third book in a series (beginning with Cooch), so there may be some character building I’ve missed, just as there may be some crucial details in the opening chapters where I missed the relevance to previous storylines. If either were the case, it might alleviate those issues for readers who are already familiar with the series.The technology is extremely cutting-edge (more than enough to excite any techno-geek), and the level of detail would be perfect – Cook does a fantastic job of educating us without falling into the trap of trying to impress us with how much he knows – were it not repeated so many times. As for the overall military strategy, that’s often where these thrillers lose me, but here it comes across as both innovative and realistic. Politically, some aspects that nagged at me, but not so much that they negated anything that was happening within the wider conflict. It is, however, a refreshing twist to have a man named Alejandro Mohammed Cuchulain as the hero of such a very American thriller, subverting the stereotypical villainization of Arab/Islamic culture.As a screenplay, Pulse would work extremely well, since those areas where I found it to be lacking would be far less obvious on the big screen. Regardless, I enjoyed the book immensely, despite its flaws - I just wish Cook had saved me so many exasperated sighs and so much eye-rolling along the way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1721O821LCW1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1V5X4K#wasThisHelpful","R1721O821LCW1C","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, talk about a lot of pressure going into a book. Due to delays with Canada Customs and Canada Post, I was late (really late) getting my copy of The Liar's Key. By the time I cracked the spine I was already aware of a slew of 5-star reviews, and even if I tried to avoid reading them beforehand, I still knew many readers who were calling this Mark Lawrence's best work to date.Yeah, as if my own expectations weren't already high enough!The thing is, early on, I will admit to a few shadows of doubt. It's a bigger book than the first, in terms of both scope and page count, and I felt like the first half of it dragged on a bit too long. I still enjoyed it, but I found it slowly losing that can't-put-down, must-read impetus I remembered from his other novels. By the time I hit the halfway mark a week later, with Jal and Snorri going their separate ways, I actually put it down for a few days.Of course, this is Mark Lawrence, and I knew that my pause wouldn't be an extended one. Call it an intermission (if you will) or a palate cleanser (if you must), but a few days later I picked it back up . . . and blew through the second half in 2 days. Yes, even if I have to stop shy of calling it his best - Prince of Fools will hold onto that coveted spot for at least a little while longer - it was still a fantastic read that turned out to be just as good as anything in the Broken Empire trilogy. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the final 100 pages rival anything he's written before, with a climax that may not be quite as frenzied or action-packed as in the previous books, but which is infinitely more dramatic, and entirely satisfying on so many levels.Oddly enough, for a book that I expected to be very much about Snorri and his quest to bring his family back from Hell, this is entirely Jal's story. In fact, Snorri is almost relegated to a background character here, overshadowed by the likes of Tuttugu, Kara, and Hennan. While they're all great characters, each with their own legitimate roles to play in the overall drama, they're most effective in illuminating some of the more noble (and inconvenient) aspects of Jal's character. As much as he likes to style himself ""a liar and a cheat and a coward,"" we see him slowly evolve through those relationships, fighting against his better side every step of the way.At the same time, his blood-fueled magical flashbacks both expose his heart and scar his spirit, revealing the truth about his mother, the Red Queen, the Silent Sister, Edris Dean, and more. Whereas Lawrence has always used flashbacks to enhance the story, here he tells a significant chunk of it through those dreams. They don't always make sense in the moment, and it's hard to see exactly where they're going, but when the pieces all fall into place, it's magnificent. The moment when Jal realizes the truth of his family legacy, and just how it plays into the Dead King's schemes, is definitely one of the strongest, most impactful scenes Lawrence has ever written.Of course, Jal's growth does nothing to absolve him of his more selfish thoughts, and those deeper revelations do nothing to interrupt his sarcastic, self-serving, narrative voice. Simply put, he's a fun guy to listen to, especially when he's whining and complaining about his fate. Even in the first half of the book, where I felt the pacing dragged, Jal's voice was sufficient to keep me coming back. As for the climax, it's that voice, and his own internal monologue, that drive so much of the final scenes. It's powerful stuff, and really serves to strip him bare and reveal the truth of his character, even as it brings the key plotlines of this volume to a close.One final word on The Liar's Key - that final paragraph, those last 27 words, may very well be the greatest cliffhanger I've ever read. I gasped, I laughed, and I threw my first in the air, ready for the promise of The Wheel of Osheim to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ10FY34OVTZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425268802#wasThisHelpful","RQ10FY34OVTZ4","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"R. Scott Bakker. Steven Erikson. Peter Watts. When you think of dark, epic, mind-bending genre fiction from north of the 49th parallel, these gentlemen are the undisputed masters. It may be uncharacteristically bold and presumptuous to demand that a new name be added to that list so soon in his career, but I'll be damned if Michael R. Fletcher hasn't earned it.Seriously, Beyond Redemption really is that good.When I first snagged an ARC of this about six months ago, I was definitely intrigued . . . but hesitant. Building an epic fantasy around madness, faith, and delusion sounded very cool. I was optimistic, but I also had my doubts. We're talking high-concept here, and I was worried that the narrative would suffer from the strain of trying to sustain the threads of madness. In fact, I'd almost talked myself out of taking that chance when, on a whim, I decided to give the first few chapters a cursory read. A few vulgar, violent, vehement exclamations of approval later, I was well-and-truly hooked. Beyond Redemption absolutely blew me away. It is indeed dark, grim, and gritty, but it's wild imagination is just as often manifested in moments of bleak, black humor. As for what it's about, this is the story of three men - one who would make a god, one who would steal a god, and one who would kill a god.Konig is the man who would make a god. As the High Priest of the Geborene Damonen, he is a proudly deluded theocratic ruler who, quite literally, is his own worst enemies. Beset by a trio of Doppels (doppelgangers) who represent his fears and insecurities, he's also victim of his own murderously rebellious reflections. Bedeckt is the man who would steal a god. An ailing, over-the-hill warrior who should already be dead, he's kept alive by the deluded belief that one last heist will change everything. He likes to think of himself as being the only sane man in a mad world, but the truth is that his delusions are just more subtle and integral to his personality. Erbrechen is the man who would kill a god. He is a fat, ugly, reprehensible madman, a Slaver by the power of his own delusions. He has merely to be carried through a town, to say a few words, and hundreds feel compelled to follow their new leader and best friend. By compelled, I mean hopelessly and helpless devoted to a man who, with a word, can rob them of the power to see, sleep, or s***, driven by nothing more than his desire for self-amusement.Before we talk any more about the characters or their deeds, I have to address the impressive level of world-building here. Fletcher spent a great deal of time inventing his world, creating the rules for its madness, and defining the outcome of each unique delusion. There are nearly twenty unique categories of delusion to his world, from Cotardists who believe they are dead (complete with rotting flesh and missing internal organs) to Somatoparaphrenics who believe portions of their body belong to someone else (causing limbs and organs to develop minds of their own). They are all defined by their inevitable pursuit of the Pinnacle, the point at which they truly lose their grip on reality, coming to be defined by their delusions, leaving them powerful enough to challenge the gods, but incapable of doing anything with that power. This is a world where the collective belief of a group of people can, quite literally, remake the landscape around them. It sounds bizarre - and it is - but Fletcher makes it all work, allowing the reader accept the power of madness as easily as we do that of magic and prayer in more traditional fantasy.The pacing here is just about perfect, careening along from one scene to another with madcap intensity. There are moments of deep philosophical reflection, but they're part and parcel of the story, not asides or info dumps. The narrative is exceptionally strong as well, making use of two languages (English and German) to weave a story that flows across the page, even if it doesn't quite flow off the tongue. The action is intense, with beautiful moments of blood and brutality, and awe-inspiring feats of madness and delusion. Seriously, with the kind of power we're talking about here, you expect some truly epic feats of destruction, and Fletcher offers them aplenty. Most importantly, the grand finale pays off in every respect, bringing together all the various characters, themes, delusions, and events in a climax that defines epic. Of course, there's also a massive cliffhanger that offers a maddening tease of the sequel, but it does nothing to negate the ending here, instead opening up a new storyto come.If you're at all curious, and are open to a story that challenges your intellect while delighting your imagination, then I urge you to give Beyond Redemption a read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6EQNPY1LLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062387030#wasThisHelpful","R1F6EQNPY1LLA","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very odd book to talk about - on the surface, it just shouldn’t work. We have multiple narrators, between whom we switch more for narrative effect than the needs of the story. We have a distinct coming-of-age story (which I’ve long since grown tired of), where the hero hides behind the persona of who he’d like to be. We have storytelling within the story, a kind of intrusive info-dumping that interferes with the forward progression of the plot. Finally, we have a plot that seems to wander without a clear direction for much of the book, before suddenly finding its direction and racing to a climax.Despite all that, it worked. The narrative was strong – from the language, to the dialogue, to the imagery. Brink isn’t afraid to write lengthy paragraphs and scenes, to take his time setting things up, and to show us his world. That, to me, is engaging. It draws me in, makes me read a bit more closely, and gives the appearance of depth (which, it must be said, is not merely appearance). As for the characters, the hardest aspect of writing a novel is to encourage that immediate emotional connection, to draw readers in, and make them care - and Brink does that very well. I liked Billy from the first time we met. He interested me, intrigued me, and made me want to know more about him. There was this welcome duality to him that allowed him to play the hero very well, even as he grew into the role. It’s less a coming-of-age tale and more a story of self-discovery.There’s a lot of imagination and fantasy flourishes here as well that really caught my attention. Even small, throw-away scenes like the dream of monsters inside the tavern are full of fantastic detail, allowing you to not just ‘see’ the danger but ‘feel’ it as well. That element of storytelling within the story really won me over. It allows for things to get a bit wild, a bit over-the-top, without dragging down the credibility of the entire story. We expect people to embellish their tales of heroism because we want to be entertained as much as we want to be informed, and Brink clearly understands that.It’s not just mindless heroism and adventure, however. There’s also a heart to the novel, a very self-aware sort of appreciation for humanity and the horrors of war. Towards the end of the story, Billy stands before an advancing army of swamp monsters and asks himself, “How monstrous can they be if they mourn?” It’s a good question, and it leads into the final evolution of Wil (the hero) coming to terms with being Billy (the boy). Sure, I would have liked a little more world building, and I would have liked more of a sense of the wider world, but those are minor quibbles to be resolved in a second book. All-in-all, Tarnish is a solid tale, a classic sort of heroic adventure that’s really pulls all the elements together in a satisfying resolution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSFBM791W2P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYHK754#wasThisHelpful","R1WSFBM791W2P4","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took a bit of a chance on this one, not knowing anything about the author, and being much more a fan of pirates than Civil War drama, but it paid off. The Abduction of Smith and Smith was a rousing adventure, well-told, and full of fantastic characters - both scoundrels and heroes.Rashad Harrison wastes no time throwing us into the deep of things, inviting us to bear witness to the back-alley press gangs of the time. It's an interesting scene, complete with some solid banter between the abductors, leading us into both a bit of mystery and foreshadowing of the Smiths' shared fate.I liked Jupiter (former plantation slave) far more than I did Archer (Confederate soldier and former slave owner), but I suspect that's entirely how we're expected to feel. After all, the former is simply looking to be reunited in freedom with his wife, while the latter is on an opium-fueled quest for revenge. Needless to say, neither man finds what they're looking for, ending up instead as very reluctant sailors.There's a lot going on in this story, often at a breakneck pace that barely allows for a breath, much less any serious retrospection. It's also a rough story, as one might expect, marked by the capricious whims of the high seas and the cruel desires of those who sail them. Captain Barrett keeps the whole thing on course, providing a scandalous (and often hilarious) counterpoint to the Smiths. It's probably wrong to like a pirate captain quite so much, but he's entirely open about his crimes, and just as honest about his motivations. Along the way, we get something of a mismatched buddy comedy with the Smiths - marred by ugly memories as it may. I wouldn't say they change so much as to reverse our earlier opinions, but Jupiter isn't quite as good as we'd like to believe, and Archer earns some genuine sympathy.The story itself demands a little more of that old willing-suspension-of-disbelief than I expected going in, but I was entirely willing to grant it the liberty. Things get crazy in the second half of the book, with bodies piling up almost as quickly as conspiracies, but rather than question it, I just smiled, nodded, and enjoyed the ride. Having said that, The Abduction of Smith and Smith does falter a bit in the final pages, as it tries to reconcile the social themes with the adventure, while forcing a resolution to the conflict that brought the Smiths together in the first place, but it's a serviceable ending, even if it's not a perfect one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GB0MLGYKVGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451625782#wasThisHelpful","R16GB0MLGYKVGD","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shadowshift is a novel that opens with an ominous, ambiguous sort of scene, one in which a shadowy figure delivers a young child to a grateful couple. It could be a back-alley type adoption, a rescue situation, or a child trafficking sort of scenario. The fact that we don't know what's going on serves to immediately unsettle the reader, causing us to question everything that comes after . . . and for good reason.From there, the story leaps ahead, introducing two separate plot-lines that are separated by a few years. It takes a while for them to converge and overlap, but it's an effective way to tell the story. It allows Peter Giglio to show his characters at their best and their worst, to introduce something of an early cliffhanger, and then to string us along for a while, making us wonder how it was resolved. We see Chet and Tina unhappy and poor, and then Tina and Hannah happy and comfortable, with the questions of how and what happened to Chet looming large between the two plot-lines. It's a narrative framework that creates some real tension and suspense, and which does so naturally.Along with the two plot-lines there are really two very different stories being told here. One is a rather standard story of a long-suffering couple, a life of crime, an escalating pattern of domestic abuse, and an inability to trust in happiness when it does come along. It's a sad, tragic kind of story, at is a little heavy-handed at times, but it really serves to establish the human element to the novel. It carries a suspense all of its own, especially as it causes us to question and doubt Tina's new-found happiness and wonder whether it's too good to be true.The other story being told here is one of supernatural talents and shadowy conspiracies. Chet is a man with the ability to shapeshift into a cockroach, while his daughter has the ability to control electronics with her mind. Dad likes to scurry beneath locked doors as the perfect thief, while his daughter just tries to make her difficult life a little more tolerable. It's definitely the coolest part of the novel, but it carries with it a deeper, darker suspense of its own. As we discover, their talents are in their blood, and that shadowy figure from the opening chapter is part of an organization dedicated to eradicating that bloodline from the world.Overall, Shadowshift is a strong, well-crafted novel that manages to build and maintain the suspense throughout. The characters are well-developed, and as cool as the supernatural element is, it's never allowed to overwhelm the human story. There were a few things that nagged at me - like why a greedy man like Chet didn't use his talent for bigger scores, and why a lonely young girl like Hannah was so reserved with hers - and I felt there were a few too many epilogues, when the story could have ended more powerfully without being to tidy, but that didn't keep me from turning pages late into the night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZ3UEW96S02R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTTI3XW#wasThisHelpful","R3HZ3UEW96S02R","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know it sounds like hyperbole and hype, but Knight's Shadow truly is a must-read book, a title that I quite literally could not put down. I found myself wandering the parking lot at the office all week, reading through lunch and breaks. I kept it on the seat beside me and read pages while waiting in line at the drive through, Last night I even followed my son around the mall, reading as we walked and he played. If you read my review of Traitor's Blade, then you know I had some challenges with the first book, and some reservations going into this, but you can forget everything I said. Not only has Sebastien de Castell completely won me over, but he's managed to top The Grace of Kings as my favorite read of the year.Seriously, it's that good.With the first book, I found that the flashbacks and history served to overwhelm the story. What happened before, especially regarding the fall of the Greatcoats, was simply more fascinating than the developing story. Here, de Castell really pulls away from those flashbacks, having Falcio, Kest, and Brasti talk about the past, but keeping us firmly rooted in the present. It shifts the focus significantly, and allows for a much better flow to the story. History is still important, and there are still mysteries to be revealed, but they accent the story, rather than drive it.As much as the characters were the strongest aspect of Traitor's Blade, I felt the book suffered a little from its focus on Falcio. Alone, isolated from his fellow Greatcoats, and developed as much through his past as his present, he conspired with the flashbacks and pacing to drag the story down. Here, we get much more of an ensemble cast. Yes, the other characters are very much defined by how they interact with Falcio, but they share the scenes. More importantly, they have significant moments of their own, allowing them to grow, to develop, and distinguish themselves. Valiana gets significant character development as well, transitioning from spoiled would-be Queen to one of the bravest and most valiant of the Greatcoats, while Darriana takes a long time to reveal herself, but proves to be most of the most intriguing and pivotal characters in the story. Even the Dukes and Knights get their moments, with several of them becoming legitimate characters, rather than just tropes or plot devices.Once again we have a nice mix of adventure, thrills, dark humor, and even darker cruelty. I laughed aloud at several points, especially the scenes involving the Knights. I'm not sure any class gets skewered quite so effectively throughout the entire series. I also found myself regularly cringing and cursing de Castell for what he put his characters through, especially Falcio. The battle of Carefal is one of the most powerful I've ever encountered in a fantasy novel, especially in how it impacts the Greatcoats and changes their entire perspective. I won't say much more than that, as the worst examples are pivotal spoilers, but I challenge you to read through the entire Greatcoat's Lament without pausing to catch your breath, punch a wall, and rail against the world.Finally, what really elevates Knight's Shadow above its first volume is the advancement of the mythologies and world building. We find out much more about who the Greatcoats are, who they were, and who they're destined to be. Similarly, we come to understand just who and what the Dashini are, and what role they have to play in the broader conflict. With the mystery of the King’s Charoites resolved, the story advances to embrace the wider conflicts and betrayals of a world on the brink of war. Every time you think you have it figured out, de Castell reveals another hidden motive or betrayal, turning the entire tale on its head more than once. It's brilliant, it's effective, and it's entirely satisfying.Thoroughly entertaining and emotionally intense, Knight's Shadow is the kind of historical fantasy that makes everything else pale in comparison. Sebastien de Castell gets inside our heads, inside our hearts, and under our skin. This is a powerful read, one that's full of surprises, and satisfying in absolutely every respect. If there's a problem, it's that it raises the bar so high, leaving Tyrant's Throne with some big expectations to fulfill . . . but that's a good problem to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSATPLSNZII0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623653983#wasThisHelpful","RSATPLSNZII0C","AVRN2OVEEGX16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVRN2OVEEGX16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SoundPEATS always surprises me because their headphones are normally one of the lowest prices. However they seem to make a really good product because they are up to the task. They connect easily to my phone and provide quality sound plus offer multiple replacement buds so you find the perfect fit.You can hear all the music very clearly and the bass comes through just fine as well so whatever music you like can be enjoyed to the fullest. For the price its one that you can be ok with getting your kids because if and when they break it you wont be out a ton of cash.

"An engaging and unusual literary platform, a fast-flowing narrative, and a real and endearing female protagonist impossible to dislike, make this an absolutely refreshing entry in the bloated and often frivolous category of chick-lit. In fact, if all chick-lit was as much fun as Harriet Greer, everyone would be reading it. When my wife downloaded this to her Kindle for me — I don’t own one, preferring the more traditional medium — I had intended to review it, keeping in mind as I always do when reading a book in a genre I don’t particularly care for (chick-lit=yuck) the audience at which the book is aiming. I can honestly say that early on in Harriet Greer, that fell by the wayside, as I was swept along and couldn’t stop reading. In fact, I read late into morning, unable to stop. Harriet Greer is that much fun, and that engaging.The device of making each chapter an entry in Harriet’s blog, lends it a diary kind of feel. But it is the wonderful writing here which brings life to Harriet, giving her warmth and humor. In some ways there is a Zellweger/Bridget Jones kind of atmosphere to all the blog entries. While the introduction of the spirit guide, Heather, on the surface sounds silly, and could easily have turned into one of those lame — and eye-rolling — chick-lit devices, it is so deftly handled by the author it is actually quite enjoyable. Part of the reason for this is because after the initial cluster introducing Heather, the appearances of the guide trying to point Harriet toward the path of real growth and self discovery, are judiciously spaced throughout the narrative. When Heather does interact with Harriet in fact, it’s quite fun.Readers will be rooting for Harriet as she tries to make better choices than in the past, deal with a sister who may be in more trouble than anyone realizes, work with a new boss while becoming entangled in romantic shenanigans not of her making, perhaps become a little famous, and hopefully grow enough to get Heather off her case. There is warmth and charm here, and the protagonist, Harriet, is delightful because the author has made her a real human being. Yes, it’s fluff, and yes, it’s chick-lit, but it’s also delicious fun.Though I had originally planned on tackling Part 2 on vacation, I ended up reading it shortly after finishing Part 1, because it is such an easy read. The same engaging and fast-flowing narrative I found so enjoyable in Harriet Greer Grows Up, Part 1, not only continues in Part 2, but becomes layered with a refreshing slice-of-life realness I do not usually associate with chick-lit. The premise of Harriet’s blog being the book we are reading continues, but is expanded upon when the blog becomes a part of the story-line after Harriet is asked by her boss and possible love interest — though she doesn’t realize it yet — to adapt the blog for the newspaper in an effort to save it from extinction. It gives the book sort of a movie-within-a-movie feel in addition to the Zellweger/Bridget Jones thing going on. The frivolous but fun device of Harriet’s spirit guide, Heather, whom only she can see, is less pronounced here but by the conclusion of Part 2, the reader realizes there will be much more to come on this front!While remaining chick-lit, there is a sense of reality not only to Harriet’s growth but her changing perceptions of the people around her — especially her roommate, Claudia. The reader feels the same way as Harriet does about her, but like Harriet, slowly realizes there is often more than meets the eye to Claudia. The change is actually remarkable, but like everything else in the book, from Harriet’s circuitous road to romance to the true-to-life family moments and situations, it happens gradually and in an insightful way, separating this from most chick-lit. I’m not saying this is in-depth angst, what I’m saying is that while enjoyable and fun, and often humorous, Harriet Greer has enough genuine moments that the reader can connect. It is the difference between watching a badly made Hallmark movie, and a really well-made Hallmark movie. Harriet Greer is the latter.I won’t spoil other readers’ fun in finding out what happens to Harriet and what further adventures may be on the horizon for the likable protagonist, but it promises to be just as much fun as Parts 1 and 2. Engaging, filled with warmth and humor, yet lacking in that artificiality so often associated with chick-lit (even the spirit guide device is fun, rather than silly), Harriet Greer is the cream in a bloated and often much too frivolous genre, and should definitely delight the audience at which it is aimed. A delicious way to pass time on the beach that won’t be a waste at all. Great fun.Disclaimer: While my wife and I purchased Part 1 to download to my wife’s Kindle (I don’t own one, preferring the more traditional print medium) because I wanted to read it, we received Part 2 from the author as a gift for review.

"I've been at this one quite a while because it’s huge. I'm of two minds about this collection, as I am many of Penzler's collections. There is some great stuff here, no doubt. Names like Hammet, Cain (Paul and James M.), Chandler, Gardner, Nebel, Charters, and Woolrich fill these pages. If you're a fan of pulp, and/or these writers, however, you might already have read Chandler's Killer in the Rain (the short story he expanded into The Big Sleep later) and Red Wind, for instance, and the same goes for some of these other names well known to those who enjoy the genre. Some of these stories were expected to be here. So if you're fairly well read on 20s, 30s and 40s pulp, the only reason to pick this one up would be the lesser known authors and stories from the higher end detective pulps. Therein exists my caveat to this collection. Penzler appears to have a bias against what is considered the B level of pulp magazines, and some of the authors who wrote in them. To my point, one of Fred MacIsaac's great Rambler stories could easily have replaced one of Penzler's picks. And though I might understand the omission of Robert Leslie Bellem's early Dan Turner: Hollywood Detective stories which appeared in Spicy Detective Magazine, due to their slightly salacious (terribly tame by today's standards, however) bend, the later Dan Turner stories were toned down and lengthier, with more plot to accompany Bellem's fantastically entertaining stories, in all their over-the-top dialog. So it is hit and miss for me on this one. I'm glad I have it, because in one book I have some of the great stories from those pulp giants I cited at the beginning of the review, all of whom are revered today. Many of those stories are four and five star gems. But I was ho-hum about some of the other stories chosen, and even more so because of some glaring (at least to me) omissions. Story choices are a matter of personal taste, of course. But seriously, no Fred MacIsaac and no Bellem, not to mention a conspicuously absent Norvell Page, in ""The Big Book of Pulps"" gives this one a downgrade, because those writers' best pulp stories are miles better than some of the picks here, in my opinion. Pulps weren't literature, they were supposed to be entertaining, and having those three guys absent here, is eyebrow raising.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C592SGCWEYR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307280489#wasThisHelpful","R2C592SGCWEYR6","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very surprised by all the low ratings for this book. I read it as a teenager when it first came out decades ago and have now read it again. It is a very entertaining read which held up well. It is very reminiscent in many ways of Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mystery novels. The atmosphere is very similar, in fact, right down to the Four Corners location and the mysticism of the Navajo and Hopi Indians. There is the social commentary in regard to the exploitation of the tribes for the resources on Indian lands, as mentioned, but mainly this is an old-fashioned thriller only marred by a good but not great ending. Most people who like Jim Chee will like the Hopi, Youngman. Most readers who enjoy the Leaphorn/Chee novels will find a great deal to like here, though it is a switch in genre from the Hillerman series. Perhaps other reviewers who haven't read (or don't like) the Hillerman mysteries, or were expecting another Gorky Park type of work from Cruz were surprised by this earlier work, and it lessened their enjoyment of what really is a good book, an old-fashioned, lean and involving story. It isn't perfect, but it has many good moments to recommend it. A solid four stars and worth a read, but if you don't like Hillerman, you won't enjoy this, as it has the same feel as that series, moved sideways into another genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPLNSOJ7YE6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1471131254#wasThisHelpful","R1WPLNSOJ7YE6E","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story involves a low-end fashion model being stalked, but in a twist midway through, turns into a little noir of love perhaps doomed by a crime.

"The Stone House Legacy by Wanda DeHaven Pyle is an evocative look at the early days of the Civil Rights movement through a fictional narrative sure to stir emotions. Each reader will react differently to the characters based on personal reminisces of these tumultuous times.The anchor for this fictional narrative is not a person, but a stone house in Indiana. A hundred years prior to the events of the narrative a diary was written, the contents of which mirror in some respects the feelings of Tessa, the wife of Simon, a minister desiring to use the house in modern times as an ecumenical base, a Center For Leadership and Understanding. He quickly latches onto the Civil Rights movement, however, becoming a popular yet controversial figure using not only his alter but his own radio show to put forth his views. He makes enemies both of those in opposition to the movement, such as the John Birch Society, and those within his own church who for a variety of reasons -- not all of them pure as the driven snow -- are not on board with using the religious pulpit for a political statement. Simon's motives are also suspect at times. His passion and charisma make him a strong voice for social change, but his almost blatant disregard for his wife's reticence to take up the cause in the manner in which he chooses, placing her squarely in the line of fire when malice and chicanery from those opposed becomes abundantly clear, is less than admirable.Simon, at least to this reader, comes across as slick, charismatic, and perhaps a bit dishonest in his true motives. More than once I thought of these slick televangelists of modern day; always on television and selling millions of books; never without a smile and an impassioned plea full of beautifully phrased thoughts; yet so perfect there is a creepy sort of facade around them, as we wonder if their motives, even if they won't admit to them, are the very celebrity they are bringing upon themselves. Though Simon might truly believe passionately in equal rights, his compassion and empathy often does not trickle down to the feelings of his wife, which does not make him a sympathetic figure for much of the book, and further serves to call his true motives into question for the reader, at least this one. When scandals befall him, some of them orchestrated by those opposed to his support for the Civil Rights movement, I found myself feeling sorry for his wife Tessa, rather than Simon. The opposition finally escalates from intimidation to open violence, but to reveal more would ruin the impact for the reader.Members of the John Birch Society and many members of Simon's group who are opposed to Simon's outspoken involvement in the movement, or the movement itself, come across no better, with their motives often clear and tarnished, bigoted, or at the very least questionable. Each reader might have a different reaction to both Simon and those opposed to him, which is probably the point. Viewing these times from a historical perspective, I could not help but be struck at the irony of the John Birch Society's arguments against the Civil Rights movement as put forth here. Believing it to be a prelude to socialism and communism, an attack on Christianity and religious freedom, and a path towards Big Government totalitarianism, one can easily do some eye-rolling folly at such an argument against equality for all Americans. However, when we look at America over fifty years down the road, that argument, so misplaced then, is incredibly apropos now. Conservative groups and Christians have been targeted by the Government (one of the articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon so long ago) and those in charge now are not held accountable. Government has been outed in regards to spying on its own allies and its own citizens, collecting personal data from people who have done nothing, and those in charge are not held accountable. Myriad scandals bring light to what millions view as deep corruption, and no one is held accountable. The beginning of this redistribution of wealth, and Government dependence, or as Churchill called it, ""Shared Misery"" has taken hold. Ronald Reagan's ""A Time For Choosing"" speech, including his warning about socialized medicine and its true intent, sounds eerily prophetic when heard today. A handful of men of good conscience in Government are forced to filibuster simply to get the Government to state that it will not use Drones to kill American citizens on American soil without due process of law. Freedom to hold a religious belief based on the Bible which does not line up with the politically correct soup du jour of the day is under fire. Was this what the John Birch Society truly feared? Did they cry ""Wolf"" at the wrong time, about the wrong cause? Or did they intentionally use fear of socialism and communism to dissuade people from supporting the Civil Rights movement? Like Simon's true motives, it is left to the reader to decide.So many characters in The Stone House Legacy have ambiguous -- at best -- motives, it made it hard for this reader to find an affinity with someone. Having read the author's lovely fictional memoir, Windborne, which has so many likable people, I found The Stone House Legacy just the opposite. One of the few bright spots here is Simon's wife, Tessa. She appears to be a lovely woman who like a lot of America during the 60s, found the times and choices confusing, even though her heart was in the right place. Her happenstance meeting with a black man in Chicago named Merriwether Lewis will show her it is the little injustices which are truly at the heart of the Civil Rights movement. She is easily the most likable character in the book to this reader. She feels a connection to the house, and the diary and dolls found in an old trunk. That connection is so strong, in fact, that she begins to see and hear things in the old stone house. Are they ghosts from Cora Herald's Civil War journal? Like many other issues raised here, the reader will have to decide.The Stone House Legacy is a thought-provoking yet evocative portrait of a society in flux during a time of social change. Depending on what you are used to, some readers might find it a bit heavy on narrative and light on ""live action"" and events. It does work for this reader, but not quite to the degree it did in the lovely Windborne. It will certainly stir up feelings for anyone who lived during these times. If I have a caveat, it is a very minor one, and rather for what is not here than for what is. While this is, of course, a fictional narrative, some very real people and events are mentioned or alluded to. Some are incomplete, however. Democrat George Wallace, who was a lightning rod for opposition, is only given a small mention, but not his party affiliation. Barry Goldwater, whose views changed over time, was named as a Republican. The role of the KKK in opposition to the Civil Rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr and others is shown on two occasions, I believe, but the organization's deep roots in the Southern Democratic Party are not. In a work of fiction such as this, it is easily understandable why the author took this route, so it would be about the times themselves, and the people, rather than politics. However, LBJ vehemently opposed Republican President Dwight Eisenhower's Civil Rights efforts and as Senate Majority Leader voted straight segregationist before finally supporting Dwight's Civil Rights Act of 1957. While LBJ's positive role in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is heralded, his motives are not shown to be two-fold. History has shown -- well documented -- that one of the reasons he did so was to build a huge voting base for his party by hijacking the Civil Rights issue. There is a widely reported comment he made about such which I will not repeat here.But perhaps these things in themselves show how motives can be ambiguous, and not always pure, as we like to believe. The Stone House Legacy should get people thinking and researching to discover that, much like the fictional characters in the involving narrative, motives were not always -- no pun intended -- black and white. An excellent weaving of a time in America with a more intimate story of the people it affected, Wanda De Haven Pyle's The Stone House Legacy is a book which will elicit many different reactions, but the most prevalent will surely be that it is a good story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RG7Z7UR1QAW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495288099#wasThisHelpful","R2RG7Z7UR1QAW6","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Evan Hunter, better known today as Ed McBain because of the 87th Precinct series, wrote Blood Relatives in 1975, nearly twenty years after the inaugural book in the series, Cop Hater, and it's a real winner. From the opening scene as a bloodied girl runs through the rain-darkened streets of Isola to get help, this one grabs you and doesn't let go. The tale Patricia Lowrey tells to the police leads them to her cousin Muriel, butchered by the man who tried to kill both of them. A line-up is arranged by Kling and Carella once they realize at a hospital they are working on the same case, and that's where it all gets interesting.Patricia fingers a cop in the line-up who was nowhere near the crime scene. This leads to the revelation that she's lying, which in turns leads to her finally telling the truth, naming her brother as her attacker and the killer of her pretty cousin Muriel. Carella can't shake the feeling the reader also has that nothing is quite as it seems, and there is an artificiality to Patricia Lowrey's new story.This one delves more into the gritty underbelly of extended families and love both requited and unrequited than the mean streets of Isola, yet has that same nourish feel to it for which the series is famous. When Muriel's diary falls into the lap of Carella by sheer happenstance, a sad and twisted story leads him to the killer. The passages in the diary is some terrific writing by McBain, adding poignancy to the story by humanizing Muriel, something you don't always get in a police procedural, which is naturally more about catching the killer than it is the victim's life.Rather than character development in each book, the reader comes to know Carella and the other cops of the 87th Precinct over the course of time in these police procedurals. This one ends as it began, in the rain, as Carella walks away. Blood Relatives is a terrific entry in the series. There is a bit of a lag in the middle, but a huge and poignant payoff for readers at the end. Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDXONZ7K2XCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612181570#wasThisHelpful","R1VDXONZ7K2XCY","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clair Blank's fabulous Beverly Gray series is more difficult to define than many other series for young adults from a bygone era. Perhaps for this reason, it is not as well-known. This is a shame because, in my opinion, it is one of, if not the finest. Beginning with Beverly Gray, Freshman, Clair Blank created a mash-up before such a thing existed. Part soap, part mystery and adventure, and part serial, each entry was inexorably tied to the former, continuing an ongoing story-line. Young adult readers of the time followed friends Beverly Gray, Shirley Parker, Lenora Whitehall, and Lois Mason from college to making their way in the world. The circle of friends was actually much wider, and more sprawling, but these are the core-four. Larry Owens and Beverly's old childhood friend Jim would also play pivotal roles in the series, as would Terry, and to a lesser degree, newsman Charlie Blaine.Beverly Gray On a World Cruise, written as a replacement of sorts for Beverly Gray At the World's Fair, which a new publisher foolishly discarded, begins a four book section which was followed by Beverly Gray in the Orient, Beverly Gray On a Treasure Hunt and Beverly Gray's Return. From the time the friends boarded the Susabella, I believe this four book section to perhaps be the zenith of the series, which remained on a level separating it from the pack throughout its long run. There is never a dull or uninteresting moment, with loads of action, adventure and mystery deftly woven into the fabric of the group defining themselves and making their way in the world both professionally and romantically. Each entry is so packed in fact, it's like a fun potboiler. And yet there is so much warmth and tenderness beneath the surface that readers can almost feel the love Clair Blank had for her creations. She makes them real, allowing them to grow personally and make mistakes, and to recover from them.There are so many characters, so much excitement going on around them, it is quite an achievement that Blank makes it all flow so easily. The reader never loses track of what's going on, nor do they become bored. The fact that each book carried on a continuing story-line was an equally astounding achievement, as Blank had to keep track of many intricate details for each character, not to mention the mystery or adventure. This series is somewhat dated, but that's part of its charm. I find Beverly Gray On a Treasure Hunt to be particularly of interest because some of it takes place -- excitingly so -- in China, as Beverly covers the war on assignment and the danger becomes all too real when she and her friends are there as Shanghai is invaded. It is one of the most exciting segments in the series, and Beverly is shot.For those who enjoy reading young adult fiction from a bygone era, the Beverly Gray series is the best. One can read these out of order, because each entry does have a satisfying conclusion, but at the same time, references made to previous events and some unfinished adventure will have readers searching for the previous and the next entry wherever you start. Ideally, readers should begin with Beverly Gray Freshman and watch Beverly and her friends make their mark in the world. These are difficult to find and often expensive, however. I'm fortunate to own twenty of the twenty-six, most with dust jackets, but still long for that Holy Grail -- due to its scarcity and price -- of young adult books from this time period, Beverly Gray At the World's Fair. Beverly Gray On a Treasure Hunt is a particular favorite within the series, and part of the four book section which begins with Beverly Gray On a World Cruise and ends with Beverly Gray's Return. In some ways, I think these four are the heart of the series, Treasure Hunt being the zenith of those. Great stuff from a great writer who should never be forgotten.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6QTV4TB0626/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z2PYPO#wasThisHelpful","R2P6QTV4TB0626","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gritty, lean, and at times surprisingly romantic, the first entry in the 87th Precinct series remains one of the best. Evan Hunter, author of The Blackboard Jungle and screenwriter for Hitchcock's, The Birds, is better known today as Ed McBain because of the 87th Precinct series. He wrote Cop Hater in 1955 in hopes of filling a void being created at Pocket Books by the slightly diminishing output of the prolific Erle Stanley Gardner. The 87th Precinct novels not only filled that void, they broke new ground, creating the first and finest of all police procedurals.It seems old-hat today, tagging along with Carella, Kling, Meyer Meyer, Hawes and the rest of the 87th Precinct cops as they tried to solve multiple crimes so they could make it home to their sweethearts or go find one, but when Cop Hater was written, it stood alone as something unique. Despite it being imitated over the decades in various ways by a lot of authors, some of them very good in their own right, it still does.In Cop Hater we are introduced for the first time to Detective Steve Carella, a mainstay of the revolving rotation of cops working out of the 87th Precinct that we would come to know over the next few decades. Carella was in love with the deaf Teddy in this one, and she'll end up playing a major role as the search for a cop killer turns very deadly and perhaps fatal for some members of the 87th Precinct.Set in the fictional Isola, which mirrored New York City, Isola is its own character here, McBain giving it a pulse and a heartbeat. When one of their own is slain, the boys of the 87th doggedly pursue every avenue they can to discover who is out there killing cops. The tawdry and seedier aspects of Isola's underbelly is shown while we follow Carella and the boys as they augment police procedures with hunches and persistence. But two more cops are slain before Carella figures out almost too late, that this particular cop hater is hiding a lot more than a .45.McBain doesn't cheat the reader during the fast and involving narrative. We see everything the cops do, including an intimate scene we read as wrong as one of the cops does. Filled with humor and grit, and more than a bit of tenderness, Cop Hater is one of McBain's finest, despite some outdated police techniques. Like John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series and Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm series, McBain always gets right into the story, and in no time you're in Isola with Carella and the boys. You don't have to start with Cop Hater to enjoy this series, but you don't want to miss it either. A real winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CP70Z9PSFS9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612183700#wasThisHelpful","R2CP70Z9PSFS9T","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I am a big advocate of books in print, it came in handy that my wife has a Kindle device when I received this as a gift from the author through Amazon. While it is nowhere near my wheelhouse, and obviously the target audience for this somewhat spicy Christmas romance is female, I gave it a read, trying to review it through the lens at which it is aimed.The story was quite surprising in many ways, more on the sweet romance side than the salacious sex camp. I'm a big Christmas guy, extremely sentimental, so I found the atmosphere of the holidays very nice as well. The biggest surprise was what an easy, fast-flowing read Sleeping With Santa was. The author has a nice story-telling ability throughout the entire narrative that makes this very readable.I suspect most readers of Sleeping With Santa will find Lily very sweet. Her backstory is just warm and tender enough to identify with and the author has very smartly avoided the pitfall of attempting more. A Christmas romance with a dose of naughtiness isn't the venue for gut-wrenching emotional angst, after all. Nick is written as a nice guy and in the instances where we get things from his viewpoint in the narrative, we see how Lily's reactions are really a bit skewed due to her own backstory and her fears for the future. This juxtaposition comes early-on and was a nice touch by the author.Some of the back-and-forth, hot and cold of Lily towards Nick drove me nuts, of course, despite my knowledge of Lily's past and the situation she had found herself in. I attribute this to being a male and therefore not being the demographic at which the book is aimed. Lily is sweet, the Christmas atmosphere when it's mentioned is nice, and the ending was equally charming. Though there did exist a couple of hot and steamy scenes, they were much closer to the end of the book than the beginning. Overall, I'd say this book will appeal to those who are put off by the fifty-shades stuff masquerading as erotica right now, which is itself masquerading as romance.As a reviewer, however, I would be remiss if I did not mention that, due to some consistent but not too frequent omissions of a preposition or conjunction, where I could tell the author had rewritten a sentence, one more proofing and edit would have been helpful. Because the narrative is so readable and fast-flowing, however, it didn't affect the book at all, at least for me. Having recently read a non-series horror book by a well-known and established author who writes one of the finest mystery series out there, and finding it to have several much more glaring proofing and editing issues, this was really trivial as far as I was concerned.For a first-time author, this was a really nice read in this genre, and I suspect a lot of those who read this will wish for a return trip to Scenic View. A very light romance read, with a bit of the holidays thrown in for good measure, Sleeping With Santa is sure to appeal to anyone looking for something in the romance/erotica vein which is more on the sparkling cider side than the one-hundred proof bourbon. Three and a half stars for what it is, and another half star for the author's attempt to go against the grain and make it more sweet than spicy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HV7K0YTUNTVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9J2U14#wasThisHelpful","R2HV7K0YTUNTVE","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for something fun to read I purchased Werewolf Nights because I could tell it was not a gore-fest but rather a story with perhaps an entertaining take on an overworked genre. The graphic art on the cover is terrific, suggesting a sort of comic book flavor with a serious twist. Therein lies my problem with the narrative, and its presentation.Books are not always what you expect so you just roll with it once you are into the flow of the author's vision. But I couldn't help feeling the more I read that perhaps the author had at some point envisioned this as an illustrated novel, or to be old-school, a comic book. I could be wrong, but that's what I kept thinking. The problem for me as someone who was happy to receive this book, and desperate to like it more than I did, was that while it might have worked well as an illustrated comic-book type of work, it didn't work nearly so well as a novel. The episodic nature of the first portion of the book made it seem a tad disjointed and even a bit confusing. This prevented any kind of narrative flow. Also, the dialog was sort of Nancy Drew at times. While it would have worked as captions in a graphic novel it didn't as a straightforward book.On the plus side, there is an underlying sweetness to the Catherine character, and a well-conceived plot and setting. But even Catherine had a bit of that Nancy Drew-all-grown-up feeling. Every guy likes her, has a crush on her, or just wants her, for instance, and Catherine is of course the one pegged to replace the female lead in a film being made in Wereville. Still, I could have rolled with it all if it hadn't been presented in fits and spurts that didn't allow me to have fun with it, and the dialog hadn't been so generic. To be fair, the second half of the book did improve, but by that time I was forcing myself to finish.The story-line and overall conception didn't happen by accident, so the author has imagination and obviously some talent. I simply feel after reading Werewolf Nights that she chose the wrong medium for telling this story; which perhaps led to the issues I had with it as a book. I would definitely give the author another try at some point. But I can't help thinking that if she hooked up creatively with a good graphic illustrator she could make Wereville a great place for fans to visit. Two and a half stars for what's here, and another half star for the promise shown for future efforts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R161PEC5EGS0RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457525747#wasThisHelpful","R161PEC5EGS0RE","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heartfelt and at times quietly moving, this memoir-like work of fiction uses the tapestry of one family in the Flint Hills of Kansas and their struggles, triumphs and tragedies over decades to paint a portrait of a country as it grows and changes with the world around it. Wanda DeHaven Pyle uses a fast-flowing narrative more than dialog to cover much ground within only a few chapters or pages, yet there exists an intimacy, as though we the reader are being offered a view from heaven of this particular family and the decisions which shaped their future and those of successive generations.Those who have read Catherine Marshall's Christy, or Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Cross Creek will hear echoes of those two voices in the author's deceptively readable narrative. Almost a Walton's type of atmosphere contains many tender and poignant moments as readers become involved in the plight of this family from the very onset. We feel a tender connection to Virginia as she bestows upon her sister the love her mother is unable to give. That connection between reader and narrative continues without waver as Virginia must move forward and leave her family behind in order to teach; a decision which will reverberate through the coming decades.It is perhaps when Virginia meets Will, however, that the die is cast for following generations. Though there are many moments of poignancy within the narrative, none are more telling than Virginia's and Jack's, giving a vivid picture of a place and time in America. When Virginia walks through her classroom for the final time because her marriage to Will has restricted her from teaching, we feel deeply for this woman whose time has not yet come, and won't until Leah. But for me, it is Jack's story, covering the war years and the aftermath of coming home which most touched me. There is no way to read this book and ever forget what sacrifices were made during the war, many of them not brought to fruition until years had passed.As with all families placed under a microscope for decades, there is love and tragedy, triumphs and poor decision-making, and a spirit passed on to succeeding generations. Spanning the time period in America from 1910-1985 there is sort of a Studs Terkel feel to the history we are seeing through the lives of this family over generations. Yet where Terkel's history is oral, by using narrative rather than dialog for the most part, here, we get something nearly cinematic. Reading Windborne is tantamount to watching a film spanning decades in the lives of one family, providing us not only a portrait of them, but also the country in which they lived. All of this makes for a fabulous and memorable read.As of the date of this review, there is a new edition of this book soon to be released, and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy memoirs and history. In its intimacy Wanda DeHaven Pyle has managed to give us a panorama of a time and place, and a nation. Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZLQP68QLQXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492189715#wasThisHelpful","R1VZLQP68QLQXJ","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to a good mystery, a fast-flowing narrative, a likable protagonist and so much Brooklyn atmosphere you can almost taste the hot dogs and smell the cannelloni, the inaugural entry in the Fina Fitzgibbons mystery series is a real winner. Susan Russo Anderson manages to avoid the pitfalls so endemic to the mystery sub-genre of female detectives by using an even-handed approach. Never does she allow the narrative to waver at any length from the mystery in favor of what I call, chick-fluff, nor does she paint the female protagonist as the typical tougher-than-the boys PI. Fina is young, pretty, capable but not invincible. She has issues relating to her mother's death, but is not wrapped up in neurosis. She refreshingly has a boyfriend who is a good guy, rather than the crappy ex so prevalent in this sub-genre of mystery. Fina has a cleaning business she prefers to hang on to, which I also find to be a welcome aside, showing a bit of balance to the character. Fina prefers not to carry, which I can only assume is a trademark of the series, leaving the gun violence to the surrounding cast of characters.Speaking of the supporting cast, I found them to be likable as well, and enjoyed my time with them. Her best friend Cookie is in college and smart as a whip, which of course makes her love-life a disaster. Again, the author doesn't dwell on this constantly, it is simply a fabric of Fina's world woven into the tapestry of the mystery. Her boyfriend Denny is a cop, and a good guy; so good in fact, he wants to marry Fina. When we meet what might have been an adversary in Detective Jane Templeton, someone with whom Fina has had issues with on a previous case, the author refreshingly alters their relationship during the course of the investigation. The dynamic of their relationship gradually becomes one of cooperation and respect. The mystery gets going when a body is dumped on Fina's steps, mirroring her mother's demise, but soon becomes a desperate search for a kidnapped child.Susan Russo Anderson allows the mystery to be the thing here, and Too Quiet in Brooklyn is all the better for it. Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote that easy reading was darn - darn was not the word he used - hard writing. It is obvious that great care was taken to make this a fast, fun read, while also making it a good mystery. It is obvious in that the effort is invisible, as it should be. The painting of Brooklyn is wonderful, colorfully woven deftly into the narrative. While I am not usually a fan of portions told from the perp's perspective, the author gets the flow and rhythm just right in these sections, keeping them brief enough, and interesting enough so that the reader doesn't become too impatient to get back to Fina and the gang.Not too gritty, yet not too fluffy, this mystery is the smell of cordite mingling with the sights and sounds of Brooklyn. Fina gets some closure concerning her mother's death before Too Quiet in Brooklyn is all over, which bodes well for the next entry in the series. Some business with a feather duster near the end strained credulity for me, muting a tense moment, but it is a minor caveat perhaps not shared by other readers. The story-line was wrapped up nicely, while opening a door for further excursions to Brooklyn with Fina and her pals, to which I'm looking forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBKOV8YGNDH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497361508#wasThisHelpful","R2PBKOV8YGNDH5","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Going in, I knew from blurbs and excerpts that content-wise, this story was far from my cup of tea, so far that I couldn't even catch sighting of my wheelhouse while reading this. So I really had to step back and put on my critic's hat and attempt to put my own personal tastes and preferences aside. With that hat firmly in place, I found this to be an extremely well-conceived and written vision of an apocalyptic world where some very unpleasant things happen. In spots there is great cruelty and very graphic violence of a nature befitting a world of Deities, Crusaders, Lashers, and Demi-gods. And if that is not enough to make a lot of people uncomfortable, some gender ambiguity and relationships might, as they did, me. And yet...This writer is very talented, penning a fast-flowing narrative filled at times with an elegant, descriptive delicacy that read like Georgette Heyer had been thrown into a dungeon and gone mad. It is to the writer's credit that this is such a meticulously crafted, darkly intoxicating read, because it is really an unpleasant world most would not wish on their worst enemy. Echo Sublimity is the backdrop for the story, heavy metal music driving it forward, dark, mythical winged creatures called the Begotton punctuating it as they return to ravish and plunder both Echo Sumlimity and its inhabitants. If they can, of course.All of these events, past and present, are centered around Reaper Demon Weaver - everyone has this type of name in Predator, it is that kind of story. Meticulously showing the family structure while slowly exposing us to the nature and culture of Echo Sublimity, the reader cannot help but be enthralled when in the chapter, Beyond the Chasm, a sexy strawberry-haired Deity arrives and explains to Reaper - and the reader - how she created this world and how the war started with the Begotton.A brief respite at the beach for many of the characters is welcomed by the reader, the surfing and beach-babe atmosphere like an offer of cold water on a scorching day. Yet it is not enough to sober us from the dark intoxication of this world, which is about to get hedonistically violent and cruel when a kidnapping occurs and the Begotton return. At this juncture, the reader is witness - unless they skip some of it - to some horrific scenes of same-gender rape and heartless violence. Even as Reaper and his friends and lovers - yeah, it's plural - strike back, we see the difference between the two groups almost become blurred, causing Reaper to question everything he believes.While I find many aspects and occurrences in this world to be unpleasant or downright repulsive, I find the writing and world-building of the author to be excellent, and as mentioned, darkly intoxicating, like the scent of Mambo. I do think that there will be those who love this to death, however. The author makes clear this is not for the sensitive. Those into heavy metal, dark and extremely graphic horror, winged creatures and Deities, however, will no doubt be eager in the worst way to revisit this world for the next installment - there is a teaser at the back. Being somewhat older, and having an aversion to many of the happenings here, I am obviously not the demographic for this book. Yet, I have no doubt whatsoever that those enamored of the aforementioned, will find something several cuts above anything of this nature they've been reading, and follow this series closely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ED207ZR29Z8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500448400#wasThisHelpful","R2ED207ZR29Z8Z","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife purchased this short story collection some time ago at a library presentation by the author, whom she happened to know. It only contains five very short stories, but after reading them recently I found them to be a pleasant diversion. Adventure in Sabah, as an elderly woman recalls an adventure shared with her husband in Malaysia involving a statue is definitely the best of the lot for my money. Biggum's Country, Chasing Dragons, I Can Walk Now and Restorante Sicily all have diverse yet distinct moods, however, from cosmopolitan café to country-life and horses. All five stories are pleasant enough to get into while not lengthy enough to become tedious. Adventure in Sabah is the most fleshed out story at a meager thirteen pages, for example. If you're looking to read something brief which doesn't require a huge emotional investment, this might be your ticket for the beach or bedtime as a reading supplement to something meatier. A pleasant enough diversion, though there isn't much here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXL59PEKVNQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493133764#wasThisHelpful","R3IXL59PEKVNQ9","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fun and flavorful RKO crime film set in Mexico gave William Lundigan better material and a bigger budget than he was used to for his lead efforts, making this one of his best. Robert Wise's sure direction and RKO's trademark attention to detail, even in their mid-budget efforts, turned an average ""B"" crime entry into a lot of fun. Jacqueline White was pleasant and pretty as the girl Lundigan was chasing, and even surprised with a lovely song so good it could just as easily have been saved for a bigger budget film with more star power. RKO touches like this are only one of the reasons it is my favorite studio for classic films.Steve Hastings (Lundigan) is an insurance detective more than happy to follow pretty Vickie Ames down to Mexico in search of her brother. The agency is still looking for both he and the necklace he may have stolen. Hastings needs to find out if either she or her brother are involved, and if not, just what happened. He starts cozying up to her on the plane and it doesn't stop when they get to Mexico, despite her initial cool reaction. We know, of course, they'll get together and figure it all out, because we've seen it all before. But this one is really enjoyable.In one reversal of form, the Mexican cops are not only honest, but helpful, and in another, even though he's basically a private detective, he's treated on the square by the cops in Mexico, as sort of the good guy. It's a nice touch which will sort of jump out at those of us who've seen a million of these. A little Spanish girl's doll may hold all the answers when the bad guys appear to have the drop, but the best moment is saved for last, leaving a smile on the viewer's face.Nice locations and sets, some fine if uninspired direction from Wise, and a really nice cast of ""B"" players make up for a not-so-lavish budget and the covering of familiar ground in this one. Just a really nice ""B"" mystery with an abundance of atmosphere that entertains in exactly the way it was intended. By far one of Lundigan's best films, and a terrific one for fans of this genre.

"Those looking for a great mystery series who have yet to discover Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are in for a treat with Skinwalkers. Tony Hillerman created an entire genre with these novels, and though they've been copied, no one has ever quite found the blend of Native American beliefs and traditions and modern day mystery Hillerman perfected. Skinwalkers is one of Hillerman's finest pairings of young Navajo Tribal Police Officer, Jim Chee, and the legendary Lt. Joe Leaphorn. This one begins when a shotgun blast into Jim Chee's trailer brings he and Leaphorn together in an effort to figure out how the attempt on Chee's life ties together with two other murders in the sprawling Indian territory they have jurisdiction over.The seasoned Leaphorn begins to have respect for young Chee as they work on different ends to solve this mystery. Leaphorn has his own personal problems to deal with as well in this entry; his beloved wife may have the onset of Alzheimer's disease. It is a distraction he can't afford when things become more and more dangerous. Sprinkled throughout this complex and entertaining mystery novel are insights into the Navajo people, from the way they speak to their customs and broad family ties. But the thread that may tie everything together is something the older Leaphorn despises, and the younger Chee embraces. That aspect of the investigation is the complex mythology of Navajo witchcraft. You see, the killings may involve something very ancient in the Navajo culture, called a Skinwalker.This is simply a great read. It starts in a languid pace which takes on an urgency as the body count starts to rise and the good police work of Leaphorn and Chee may not be enough to save either of them. Chee is getting noticed for his smart police work in the New Mexico desert, but he is also getting noticed as an Hataalli (Medicine Man) who can perform The Blessing Way, and it will play an integral part in this great book. Skinwalkers is like an orange soda on a hot day in the New Mexico desert. A fine entry in a series mystery fans will devour.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OA9IVPEG6NGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E32F9Z2#wasThisHelpful","R2OA9IVPEG6NGA","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"South Korea has owned romance in film since the mid-nineties, creating a lovely genre of tender romanticism untouched by Hollywood or any other country producing films. It has also created a unique genre in horror films, and action films, both often remade by Hollywood but not nearly as well-done. With South Korea's romance genre, both the tender and poignant films, and the romantic comedies, Hollywood doesn't even try, and that's just as well, because the sensitivity and romanticism so deftly displayed in South Korean films no longer exists within Hollywood's film industry, at least as a whole.In this tremendously charming and engaging offering starring the marvelous Son Ye-jin, romantic comedy is surprisingly melded with supernatural horror with results both hilarious and tender. This is a testament to just how entertaining and well-made South Korea's films are, that two diametrically opposed genres could be so wonderfully blended together and produce such a lovely afterimage for those lucky enough to view this film.In this film, a nerdy, struggling magician becomes a huge success after being entranced by a morbid girl attending one of his shows. She proves the key to his success, his otherworldly stage act fueled by her very real struggles with seeing the dead. But as with all South Korean films, her story is much more involved, and much more poignant than the viewer or the young magician initially understands. It is this haunting of her that makes it nearly impossible for her to be close to anyone, including her family, and especially, the young magician, who although he has a girlfriend, finds himself attracted to her.Son Ye-jin's terrific performance as a girl forced to live like a ghost gives this film its tenderness, most prominently in a very poignant scene on the phone where she breaks down and admits just how terribly lonely she truly is. Not to be outdone, however, Min-ki Lee has an almost equally moving breakdown across the phone in a last-second attempt to keep his love from leaving him. One does not expect from these descriptions of the film for it to be so truly and utterly hilarious, but it is. This is also a romantic comedy, a light and playful tone sustained all the way through the belly-laughs of the closing credits. Most of the humor revolves around the reactions to the very horrific situations, which eventually threaten both halves of the romantic-bound duo.There is as much warmth as there is charm in this marvelous confection from South Korea, and just as many laughs. This is just about as perfect as a light romance can get, but it is the uniquely South Korean ingredients of romanticism and longing for love that make it an unmissable film for those who enjoy romantic comedies with a heart, and a few creepy scares. A must-see for romantics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKAW7UNM5TBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XEANH4#wasThisHelpful","R2UKAW7UNM5TBV","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sunny and romantic feel of Dorothy Macardle's wonderful book about a young brother and sister buying a home on the English coast and getting more than they bargained for was kept intact in this true film classic. Victor Young's beautiful score captured perfectly the light and comical intruded upon by a haunting mystery and ghost story. His ""Stella by Starlight"" is on a par with David Raksin's ""Laura"" as one of the most evocative songs ever written for a film.If asked to name the most beautiful star of the 1940s, most would probably tag Hedy Lamarr or Gene Tierney. But if asked who was the prettiest, most would say Gail Russell. She will always be remembered for her role as the young and lovely Stella Meredith, looking for love and acceptance from a mother long-deceased. Tragedy took this radiant star from us at a young age but she lives on in films like this one.Ray Milland is excellent as always as Roderick (Rick) Fitzgerald and Ruth Hussey is his sister Pamela. They are both excited when they happen upon the beautiful house along the coast called Wynwood (Cliff End in the novel). They purchase it from the Commander (Donald Crisp) under protest from his lovely granddaughter Stella (Gail Russell). Her reason for not wanting the house sold is revealed when a light and enjoyable romance blossoms between she and Roderick.She and Roderick go sailing and Russell is breathtaking with the ocean breeze blowing her hair. Roderick gets sea sick in an amusing moment and Stella's longing for a connection to the mother she lost when she was just a toddler is highlighted for the first time when she reveals the perfume she wears has the same mimosa scent as the one her mother wore. It is a scent that fills the nursery in Wynwood and gives Stella a feeling of being loved when she is there.But all is not well at Wynwood, with a sobbing heard late at night and a sea-fog driving Stella to the cliff where her mother fell and died. It is all tied to the mystery of a young Spanish Gypsy girl named Carmel who posed for Stella's artist father. Stella is protected and loved one moment, and in danger the next. Roderick loves Stella and knows he must somehow solve the mystery of what happened to rid their lives of this cloud so he that and Stella can be happy.Dr. Scott (Alan Napier) may help them find the answers as he has access to notes the doctor of Stella's mother and Carmel made. Dr. Scott is also smitten with pretty Pamela, and it appears both Roderick and Pamela could be happy if only they could bring warmth back to Wynwood House.To reveal more would lessen your pleasure if you have not experienced this wonderful film from the 1940s. There are some genuinely eerie moments mixed in with the lighthearted, but at its heart this is really a romance. It is that blend of romance and supernatural mystery which make this the best film of this kind ever made, and certainly one of the most romantic films of the 1940s.The shy and beautiful Gail Russell will always be associated with the young and searching Stella Meredith in the hearts and minds of moviegoers. Viewers will fall in love watching Russell in one of her most memorable roles. A must see film for classic movie lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUF5J022BVJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZP1C9K#wasThisHelpful","R1BUF5J022BVJW","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Every guy's seen you before, somewhere."" -- Johnny to JoyceThe Blue Dahlia is one the finest noir films made during the 1940s as everything is absolutely perfect in the third of four films Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake would make together. Raymond Chandler wrote the original screenplay and George Marshall turned in his finest directing job in this screen classic. This film has the perfect blend of grit and gloss, romance and female treachery, and while the outlook of its anti-hero isn't quite as jaded as it would have been had Howard Hawks filmed this, it still packs a punch.Lt. Morrison (Ladd) returns from WWII with his two buddies only to find his wife Helen (Doris Dowling) has been unfaithful; in your face unfaithful, and responsible for his son's death while he was away. He confronts her at a party and blows out in a storm, unaware that someone kills her with his own gun only hours later. Joyce Harwood (Lake) meets him for the first time when she offers him a ride in the rain and an attraction between the two begins.This film is everything others of its kind during the 1940s tried to be, but often failed either in execution or atmosphere. The noir elements of the story are blended expertly with romantic touches sprinkled throughout, creating a masterpiece in the genre. A scene as Johnny and Joyce cross paths a second time in a restaurant overlooking the sea is a particular standout, the romantic view brought back into dark focus when he overhears a bulletin on the radio alerting him he is being sought by the police for the murder of his wife.Like Johnny, Joyce is running from something, and trying to help him takes her right back to The Blue Dahlia nightclub. Johnny's loyal war buddies are on hand to help him but the shell-shocked Buss (William Bendix) can't quite remember what he did the night Johnny's wife was murdered. The list of suspects begins to grow and includes a slimy hotel detective and the guy Joyce is all tangled up with, who just happens to be, of course, the owner of The Blue Dahlia. Lake's Joyce is softer than some noir heroines but still holds back information, just a shade less than being on the up and up.This may be the most entertaining 100 minutes you'll ever spend watching a film in this genre and is certain to become one of your favorites once the end credits roll. Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake were one of the great screen couples, and one of the most popular during the 1940s. Johnny alludes to Joyce being the girl we all dream about for ourselves near the end of the film when he keeps her from driving away. Ladd and Lake were a dream come true for Paramount, and movie audiences. A fabulous film not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGZTBIUQYEVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBE97S8#wasThisHelpful","R1EGZTBIUQYEVY","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Why are you Paul's friend?"" - Veronica Lake""Because he's on the dead up-and-up. Why don't you try it sometime?"" - Alan LaddDashiell Hammett's story of crime and politics got a second filming with this glossy Paramount production starring Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. Ladd had exploded into stardom opposite Lake in ""This Gun for Hire"" but set the tone for the type of character he would play in the majority of his films with this one.A good screenplay by Jonathan Latimer and some fine photography from Theodor Sparkuhl complement Stuart Heisler's crisp direction. Oddly enough, Victor Young, known more for his romantic scores, was picked for this project and does a nice job. Lake, whose cool blonde beauty was a perfit fit for Ladd's quietly tough screen persona, is also a perfect fit in every creation of Edith Head.Brian Donlevy has a good role as the political boss, Paul Madvig. Ladd is his right hand man, Ed Beaumont. Paul is all brawn and not a lot of brains, but Ed is loyal because he is genuine. When Madvig falls for Janet Henry (Veronica Lake), the daughter of the reform candidate, he swings his political machine his way and angers the crooks he's been protecting.Joseph Calleia is one of the crooks unhappy with Paul and not quiet about it. William Bendix is excellent as his off-kilter muscle, Jeff. When Janet's wayward brother, Taylor (Richard Denning), who was secretly seeing Paul's little sister, Opal (Bonita Granville), winds up dead, Nick (Calleia) will use the newspaper he has in his pocket to implicate Paul in the muder.Ed knows Paul didn't do it but also knows he's hiding something. He creates a public rift with Paul in order to discover what's at the bottom of it all and gets much more than he bargained for. But Ed can't distance himself enough from the growing attraction between he and Janet. Even when she tries to enlist his help he is leary of her, and tells her: ""You're slumming and I don't go for slummers. You think you're too good for me. Well sister, it just so happens I think I'm too good for you!""Frances Gifford shines in a small role as the nurse taking care of Ed after a beating from Jeff. It is Bonita Granville who steals every scene she's in, however, in a rare adult (sort of) role. Ladd calls her Snip throughout the film, sort of reminding her she isn't all grown yet. While it is too glossy to have the bite it should have, it is very entertaining and has a great cast. The ending is terrific and just what the viewer had hoped for. Ladd and Lake fans will love this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXKDAWYAYGGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBE9684#wasThisHelpful","R3UXKDAWYAYGGN","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This love story from Korea has the tenderness of snowflakes carried gently from the heavens on a soft winter breeze. From its sepia-hued opening to its final shot, this film will gently squeeze your heart until you feel the ache of love, and smell its fragrance. Filled with moments of great romantic beauty and heartbreaking sadness, its complex story is told with a simple grace and elegance, making it one of my personal all-time favorites.Kim Ha Neul is endearing as Soeun, a shy college student in love with classmate Donghee. Their story of gradually getting together has a sweet innocence of yesteryear. It is in stark contrast IN (Yoo Ji Tae), whose girlfriend is brash and quarrelsome. He is concerned, in fact, that she may be sliding into alcoholism. But underneath there is a yet untapped depth which will flourish near the end of this story. It is the otherworldly manner in which their paths cross which is at the crux of this film.Souen's life in college consists mainly of visiting the hospital where her best friend, Sumi, is recovering from a broken leg. But late at night, she begins talking on a HAM radio to IN. But the radio, given to her by another student, is reportedly broken, and does not work. Their conversations are at first contentious, she disbelieving of his claim that he is attending the same college, but 20 years later. Much to his girlfriend's displeasure, he makes arrangements to meet Souen. But it is a bridge too far to traverse. Each initially believe the other stood them up. Her continued concern about current events, however, prompts him to give her news of future happenings. It is then that both realize something very special is occurring; they are living in different times.Whereas most films would use this as a device to propel their love across time love story, director Jeung Gueon Kin and photographer Kwang Suck Jung take this in an entirely different direction. Soeun and IN do come to care for each other, however, he becoming her diary for her fledging romance with Donghee, while he wrestles with his girlfriend's drinking, and her skepticism that what he's telling her is actually happening. His sudden realization that his parents are attending college with Soeun leads to a romantically heartbreaking bit of information that changes both their lives forever. It also changes his girlfriend's mind about what has been happening, and she decides to support IN. In an emotionally gut-wrenching scene, he discovers the scent of love still remains. To reveal anything further would ruin the experience for those who have yet to see this piece of film magic.Ditto unfolds in a deceptively simple manner, its touching depth sneaking up on you at the end. The two most wonderful things about this film are Kim Ha Neul's lovely performance, and the hauntingly beautiful score. A film which takes something from your heart, but gives something greater back. A must see for romantics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEWT0MR7A9VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TH79WM#wasThisHelpful","R2UEWT0MR7A9VI","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The moment has charm."" -- Charlie ChanCharlie Chan is in romantic San Francisco in Behind That Curtain. Earl Derr Biggers wrote in a style which lent itself to romance as well as mystery. Perhaps only M.M. Kaye blended the two as perfectly as Biggers. Once embarked on this Chan adventure, one feels the trade winds of Hawaii calling our detective back to Honolulu for the birth of his 11th child. Yet the romance of a misty San Francisco still filled with the orient beckon him to stay and solve just one more crime. Behind That Curtain has so much atmosphere it washes over the reader like a sudden rain shower. Fortunately, we are in the most lovely of 1920's cities, with cable cars and quaint bungalows for shelter. Dark passages and murder do exist here, however, and we can consider ourselves lucky that the elegant Chan has stayed over to guide us away from danger.Bill Rankin is a reporter with the idea of bringing together the visiting sleuth from Honolulu and Scotland Yard's Sir Frederic Bruce. Their stories of crimes solved will make a good feature. But it is Frederic's regrets in connection to an unsolved murder, and the seemingly unrelated disappearance of Eve Durand from India nearly 15 years prior that haunt the conversation. Barry Kirk and the pretty young D.A. he's immediately smitten with, June Morrow, plead for Charlie to stay when Sir Frederic is murdered. There are as many suspects to ponder over as there are mysterious clues. But which is that elusive 'essential clue' so beloved by Scotland Yard?Charlie wants none of it, and only once onboard the S.S. Maui, of the famous Matson line, does an overheard conversation in an adjoining cabin have the Chinaman rushing down the gangplank to join Barry and June. They must all contend with Captain Flannery, however, whose methods are as heavy-handed as Charlie's are subtle. Charlie discovers evidence of two other missing young women, and suspects a possible connection to the unsolved Hilary Galt murder. How does a world famous adventurer fit into the picture? Are the slippers the essential clue, or something else? In the end, it is of course our favorite detective from the Islands who realizes the clue has been there all along.The mystery is as much fun as racing down Nob Hill in a 1920's roadster in search of a clue. There is an innocence to the romance between Barry and June borne of another time. Chan is at the top of his game here, both funny and wise. The final scenes hold both humor, and inevitably, as was Biggers' custom, a dash of the romantic. This Charlie Chan is great fun and has one of the most charming endings of any Biggers wrote. A must read for those who like their mysteries old-fashioned, and a bit on the romantic side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3OBHZ56O4FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604445335#wasThisHelpful","R3O3OBHZ56O4FS","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No words ever written in any language could describe the tenderness and beauty found in this most wonderful Korean film from director John H. Lee. Both romantic and sensitive, it captures that joy we feel upon finally finding that someone where our heart can rest, and the gut-wrenching pain of watching them slip away before our pleading eyes.It begins as Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) is trying to put her life back together after an embarrassing office affair with her married boss ends in heartbreak at a train station. She returns home to live with her family, her loving father understanding rather judgmental. His foreman, Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung), a carpenter, meets her by chance at a mini-mart where she has forgotten the can of Coke she just purchased. When they meet again she is embarrassed, but when he comes to her rescue during a street robbery a sweet romance begins.There is humor and a wonderful sweetness to the couple's courtship missing in many films. That sense of longing and happiness just out of reach so prominent in Korean dramas will only gradually come into play as little by little Su-jin begins forgetting more and more and realizes something is wrong. Spanish love songs create a romantic and playful atmosphere during the first half of the romance which finally gives way to the film's lovely refrain during the heartbreaking latter half.Lee paints a very real love which makes this not only rise above tear-jerker status, but put it into the romantic masterpiece category. Son Ye Jin is both beautiful and wondrous in her performance, and in the latter portion, Jeong Woo Sung lends depth to a young man faced with a loss so great it might destroy his life. Their day-to-day hardships and romantic plans are intruded upon by a devastating illness one is not supposed to get at the age of twenty-seven.Their love and happiness as she quits her job and he leaves notes and pictures all over their house to remind her of things is quite emotional, but in a quiet way which the director never allows to become maudlin. When she realizes in a moment of clarity that she is breaking his heart she makes a decision which changes both their lives. But this film is not over, and its beautiful conclusion will choke you up and lift you up at the same time.This film is unforgettable, and will become a part of anyone who sees it. For any person with the capacity for love deeper than the surface, A Moment to Remember will touch your heart and spirit and never fade from memory. A must own film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFQXOEPG1QT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P1XEIK#wasThisHelpful","RLFQXOEPG1QT8","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can almost feel the gentle trade winds of Hawaii during the 1920's in this classic novel by Earl Derr Biggers. Romantic and full of atmosphere, this is a most enjoyable read that was our first introduction to Charlie Chan. Biggers was always a great romance writer who simply incorporated mystery into his books to propel the story forward. This was never more evident than in The House Without a Key.The story centers around young and very proper John Quincy Winterslip of Boston, who has been sent to retrieve the elder Minerva Winterslip from the semi-barbaric Pacific Islands of Hawaii. When his ship stops in San Francisco on its journey to the islands, however, John Quincy's idea of who he is begins to change, and the possibility that there is a world outside of Boston and Beacon Hill begins to take shape. A mysterious errand in the city by the bay for the black sheep of the family, Dan Winterslip, also living in Hawaii, will begin an adventure that will in the end make him a man.The murder of Dan Winterslip shortly before John's arrival will reveal old family secrets from a time when Hawaii was wild and dangerous, and a port for all the world. John Quincy does not understand the nostalgia Minerva and others feel for this time in Hawaii's history. But there is romance in those trade winds blowing the cocoa palms. John will meet Carlota Egan, a girl who could not be further away from the fiancee awaiting him back in Boston. But as John Quincy begins to help his lovely cousin Barbara and Minerva get to the bottom of Dan's murder, Boston seems like a distant memory.Luckily for John, Hawaii's best police detective will help him unravel the clues that will lead to an exciting revelation, and in the process become his friend. That detective is Charlie Chan. An Asian who has been in Hawaii many years, Chan navigates the mystery with little to go on, but with much wisdom and humor. The Charlie Chan of The House Without a Key is subtle and endearing. Chan may be Chinese, but his very American take on a piece of pie he is not happy with is a hoot!Biggers truly makes both his characters and the islands of Hawaii come alive in his first novel in which Charlie Chan appeared. His descriptions of Hawaii as seen through the eyes of the characters are nostalgic and filled with beauty. The House Without a Key is that rare novel which can be read with pleasure by both those who love a good mystery, and those who love a light and atmospheric romance. If both are your cup of tea, this great classic is definitely for you. It is a great read during summer, when things are bright and cheery, or during winter, when you want to escape.You can't miss with this one. Make yourself one of those drinks with an umbrella in it, grab your oversized Hawaiin luau shirt and head on out to the lanai for a grand time between the covers of this mystery classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUDIHL6EOX1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XY5KH2#wasThisHelpful","R2QUDIHL6EOX1W","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the resemblance to the famous radio show is sketchy, this second entry in the ""B"" movies about The Shadow, otherwise known as Lamont Cranston, is quite fun. Rod La Rocque adds more than a dash of charm and humor to his role as Lamont Cranston, who here is a radio crime fighter who uses his show to expose crooks, and often exposes the ineptitude of Commissioner Weston in the process.Astrid Allwyn is really nice as Phoebe Lane, the station owner's relative who wants to break into radio. She gets Cranston into plenty of hot water when she hands him a note on the air and he announces it without checking it out first. The crime isn't as important as the trappings and the stylish performances in this entry, which includes an excellent turn by Lew Hearn as the cab driver, Moe, who gets Cranston and Lane out of more than one jam as they try to get to the bottom of things.There is humor and panache in La Roque's performance and the film itself. It is very fun to watch for those who enjoy ""B"" mysteries, and while it may not be exceptional, it is quite enjoyable. It is too bad that more entries in this series, and for that matter, more ""B"" mysteries, aren't as easy and pleasant to watch as this second attempt to cash in on the radio popularity of one of the greatest figures in that medium's history. All-in-all, a fun film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJW9QLPAKOEX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J31P8I#wasThisHelpful","RJW9QLPAKOEX8","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romance on the Run is movie-watching that becomes surprisingly fun in this snappy and charming little ""B"" from Republic Pictures starring Donald Woods and Patricia Ellis. Director Gus Meins gives Jack Townley's screenplay from an Eric Taylor story just the right pacing and atmosphere. There is also just a bit more polish than usual for a ""B"" picture and the performances by everyone are first rate, particularly the two leads and Edward Brophy, who supplies the humor.The story is reminiscent of a Boston Blackie, with Donald Woods' excellent turn as Barry Drake similar to the style and character of Chester Morris in those films. It is all about suave Drake trying to recover a stolen necklace, and seemingly succeeding. When it turns out he's recovered a phony, both he and the secretary for insurance man J.W. Ridgeway chase the the two culprits with the necklace from Cincinnati to New Orleans while Lt. Eckhardt of the police chase them.William Demarest of My Three Sons' television fame is likable mirroring the Faraday part in the Boston Blackie series and Grace Bradley is also fine as Lily Lamont, one half of the thieves Drake and Dale Harrison are chasing. Some backwoods humor, including a moment about ""Revenuers"" as Drake has to backtrack once he discovers who really has the necklace makes for great fun. The ending doesn't let the viewer down as a romance begun on a train finally reaches its destination.All-in-all, this little ""B"" gem from 1938 will get very high marks from fans of that genre of film. While so many are slow-moving and dull, this one has a good script and sparkling, energetic performances. Woods and Ellis -- a WAMPAS baby who often referred to herself as the Queen of ""B"" pictures at Warners -- along with Edward Brophy and William Demarast make this one a 53-minite ""B"" mystery fans won't want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3643SYBKYFOFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028NSEGY#wasThisHelpful","R3643SYBKYFOFA","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little ""B"" gem from Mascot Pictures, one of the ""Poverty Row"" studios who specialized in low-budget fillers for double-bills, is quite entertaining. While the storyline sounds familiar the execution is done with humor and flair, and an excellent cast.It all begins on a dark, stormy night as Jasper Whyte (Charley Grapewin) reveals to his servants and relatives that he is giving them each one million dollars. Since his long-missing granddaughter, Doris Waverly, is the only one who could throw a monkey-wrench into the plan, their inheritance seems assured.But Doris shows up, of course, in the form of Evalyn Knapp. As the old man dotes on her, grateful for her sweet return, the rest of the household fumes. Things take a u-turn when a second Doris Waverly (Mary Carlisle), an actress not nearly as passive as the first, appears right on her heels.Before the first Doris can be exposed as an imposter, she is murdered and we have ourselves an old dark house murder mystery. Sheriff Jenks (Fred Kelsey) isn't that much help when he shows, nor is Doris' pal from the stage, the ""Great Luvalle (Wallace Ford). Tom Dean (Regis Toomey), the easygoing and fun-loving member of the clan, takes a real shine to the second Doris (Mary Carlisle) and decides to do a little detecting.An attempt on Doris' life by poison blowdart adds to the fun in this easy to like ""B"" mystery. This is great entertainment for late at night when you can't sleep. Famous gossip columnist Hedda Hopper plays the part of Laura Proctor in this one, for a little added nostagia.Many of these ""B"" films are just slow-moving imitations of the real thing, but this one has some snappy dialog and a fun atmosphere to recommend it, not to mention a fine cast. A good rainy night time killer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZG4QD6GGRNXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XF1VV6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZG4QD6GGRNXC","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some spy novels get better and more relevant with age, and Robert Ludlum's fabulous The Matarese Circle falls into that category. What it lacks in literary aspirations it more than makes up for in sheer excitement and fun. Written over 30 years ago now, its story line seems almost prophetic, the world finally catching up to the plot. A spy thriller this wildly entertaining isn't supposed to give you such pause afterward, as you look around the globe, yet it does. Riveting is a word too often used by publishers attempting to hype their book and generate sales. It is the perfect word to describe what lies between the covers of this terrific thriller.Two high level executions, one on each side, are mere tests of controlled reactions by a group whose name is not even whispered within the hallowed corridors of power in Washington or Russia. It began in the hills of Corsica decades before and now moves covertly in the shadows. Two men in the world are the best in their field, and soon the Matarese has manipulated both governments into the unthinkable: an order of unsalvageable for both men. Brandon Scofield and Vasili Taleniekov have been on a collision course for decades, but now the Russian will secretly reach out to his sworn and deadliest of enemies to help him stop the Matarese from controlling the world.This is a lightning paced spy thriller with more globe trotting action than any ten others in the genre combined, yet it comes off eerily plausible somehow. The Matarese control through fanatical belief in their cause, creating chaos in governments through financial control and political upheaval; financing violent groups unaware they are mere pawns of the Matarese. Unless Scofield and Taleniekov can stop them, the Matarese will soon superpower through assassination and another through election. Then, what began in those Corsican hills will span the globe.A young woman from Corsica will give Brandon Scofield new life, but perhaps too late, as he may have to sacrifice it to save his country. And Taleniekov will discover just how far the fever has spread when he contacts old friends. Only Beowolf and the Serpent can track down the heirs and heiresses to a group so deadly and insidious a simple whisper means death. And even then, it is unreasonable to think both could survive the journey. For the reader, it is a spellbinding read that keeps you turning pages late into morning. A book so exciting, written over 30 years ago, in the midst of a cold war which no longer exists, isn't suppose to be this much fun, or this disturbing.Ludlum revealed to readers he patterned The Shepherd Boy after Spanish financier Juan March Ordinas, and the Matarese idea sprung from rumors that the Trilateral Commission was attempting to create one world government. He embellished on this premise and created one of the most action filled spy novels ever written. A wild ride that is both gripping and tremendously enjoyable. If you only read one spy novel in your lifetime, make it this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZD7EXVXNZ0FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553025899#wasThisHelpful","R1ZD7EXVXNZ0FD","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote some terrific mysteries dating back to the early 1900's. The Yellow Room, originally published in 1945, is one of her best. It is old-fashioned in a good way. This is a classic and very entertaining example of the mystery genre. There is a pretty young girl, a murder, suspects and intrigue involving the young woman's family, and, of course, a dashing war hero in love with the heroine and only too willing to use every means at his disposal to get her out of the jam and solve the mystery. Rinehart creates a fun and exciting atmosphere for mystery lovers to enjoy, as well as a pretty good brain teaser.Young Carol Spencer is a likable heroine trying to recover from the loss of her fiancee in the South Pacific. She longs to keep busy and wants to make herself useful in the war effort. She has been forced to care for her mother, however, as her selfish sister Elinor is too busy in her society functions to help. When Carol leaves New York for Maine to open up their home there, she discovers many unsettling mysteries. Lucy, the maid, for instance, is missing, and it is soon discovered that she is in the hospital with an injured leg. Someone unknown has chased her in the night until she fell down the stairs. It could be that someone who has been staying in the yellow room, even though no one was living in the Spencer's Maine home. Worse, there is a very dead young woman in the closet. When it is discovered that she came there asking for Carol, she herself becomes a suspect in the eyes of the local police.Dane is the war hero next door still recovering from a leg injury before heading back to his men. His past is a bit of a mystery also, and his meddling in the case is unappreciated by the local police. Carol hasn't a clue who to trust, and when her brother, also a war veteran arrives on the scene, the mystery becomes murkier. Carol's snotty sister's car was seen the night of the murder, even though she was supposedly in New York. Was Carol's brother involved somehow? Who has been stealing her mother's fine china from the house? What was the dead girl's relationship to her brother and sister? Dane uses every man and instinct at his disposal to root out the killer and get to the bottom of things. Shots in the night and the mysterious actions of someone unknown, yet moving easily among her Maine neighbors, can only spell danger for Carol.The mystery is very old-fashioned and so is the romance. Dane falls in love with Carol before a kiss is exchanged. As was the case in more romantic times, he puts himself in harm's way to save Carol, even though his own future is uncertain. This is very much a mystery where you can sense WWII and the changes it made in young men. The mores of a bygone era are in the forefront in this enjoyable and atmospheric mystery from one of the greats in the genre. For those who enjoy their mysteries in this vein, The Yellow Room is a lot of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35S978WV3C3NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CKJWW#wasThisHelpful","R35S978WV3C3NR","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A rainbow is the door to heaven.""Few films of today can compare with the tenderness of pure romantic love displayed in silent film, or the depth and glow sound brought to romance during the classic film era, but over the past decade, South Korea has blended something wonderful from both art forms and captured a transcendent beauty unmatched. A sense of longing for love and happiness just out of reach hangs over many of their finest romanticist efforts giving them an emotional ache not felt when watching anything else. An epic love story, The Classic is a beautiful river, filled with love and longing, promise, and dreams shattered by fate and circumstance. Like all rivers, it keeps flowing, eventually returning to where it began, completing a circle.Son Ye-jin gives a tender and beautiful performance in a dual role as two love stories are played out over time, intertwined and connected in ways which only become clear in the final heartbreaking moments. Jo Seung-woo as Joon-Ha, and Lee Ki-woo as his friend, Tae-Su, make a considerable contribution to the story of Joo-hee (Son Ye-jin), told in flashback. Son Ye-jin also portrays the daughter of Joo-Hee, Ji-Hae, during the present day. Jo Ing-sung as Sang-Min, and Lee Soo-in as her possessive friend, Su-Kyeong, round out the modern day triangle as letters and diaries of her mother help her understand the present. Written and directed by Kwak Jae-yong with great sensitivity and understanding, the director of My Sassy Girl and Windstruck gets everything perfect here, right down to the music. Everything from Beethoven to The Swinging Blue Jean's Hippy Hippy Shake is used to wonderful effect. Most beautiful, however, is the haunting Saranghamyon halsoorok (If We Are in Love, Then..) used to underscore many tender and emotional moments in both love stories.Ji-Hae (Son Ye-jin) is going through a box of her mother's love letters and diaries as this epic love story opens, and soon it will lead to flashbacks showing a parallel between past and present. Ji-Hae has been writing love letters for her girlfriend Su-Kyeong (Lee Soo-in) so she can get and hold on to her popular boyfriend, Sang-Min (Jo In-sung). It works well except that Ji-Hae has fallen in love with him herself while doing so. Insecure, possessive, and sensing Sang-Min has unspoken feelings for her friend Ji-Hae, Su-Kyeong constantly reminds her just who his girlfriend is. Son Ye-jin is marvelous here, shy and demure, with little hope of happiness because her best friend has everything she loves. Sweet, she immerses herself in the love story of her mother, only to find parallels to the present, and a deeper understanding at the right moment, which comes after a romantic run in the rain with the boy she loves. By this time, the viewer is deeply involved in the story of her mother, Joo-Hee, as it is told in flashback. Perhaps a more romantic and heartbreaking story has never been put on film.If Son Ye-jin is marvelous as the daughter, Ji-Hae, she is ethereal as Joo-Hee, giving a Janet Gaynor type performance not seen since Seventh Heaven or Street Angel. The situation in which her daughter finds herself is reversed in flashback, with Joon-Ha (Jo Seung-woo) writing letters for his best friend Tae-Su (Lee Ki-woo) so he can get the lovely pig-tailed daughter of an important man. It is Joon-Ha who is enchanted by Joo-Hee, however, and as their love grows, so does their guilt, as Tae-Su is a good friend and loves her also. These two triangles, decades apart, becoming deeply involving, filled with charm and tenderness, and humor. To reveal too many details would be a disservice in regards to this film, where so much happens. Sprawling, yet intimate, with a sense of tragedy somewhere down the road the viewer can't quite get a handle on, this is a beautiful film all classic film fans will adore and embrace. A cross between Maytime and Random Harvest, it is a film never to be forgotten once seen. A haunted house, a run in the rain with no umbrella, and fireflies at night become magical recorded moments of love told through flashback. Even war intrudes on happiness in this romantic poem to love being a river.A necklace may be the link between the past and present, so that love can finally overcome fate, in this lovingly rendered and beautifully acted film only Korea could make. Heartbreaking on one front and hopeful on another, director Kwak Jae-yong shows love as a river which always comes back for those who wait and hope for what seems just out of reach. Often difficult to find, great romanticist films are still being made, and South korea is leading the way. This version is for those who require a region three DVD, but it can be found in other formats. Worth tracking down a copy. A beautiful film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENB10GVPNZP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CIJMTU#wasThisHelpful","R1ENB10GVPNZP0","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rain is falling hard as this dark noir melodrama opens, and after the night is over, it will always be raining for Martha Ivers. Lewis Milestone directed this tale of a life-long guilt that festers until misplaced suspicion destroys one person and puts another out of her misery. There are good performances from a great cast, none better than Lizabeth Scott's as a girl down on her luck and hoping against the odds for something good to happen. She is the outside element to three lives bound together since childhood by a crime that has haunted two of them into adulthood.This is a strange noir in many respects, mostly due to Milestone allowing the moviegoer to see the story in chronological order, rather than using flashbacks. It creates sympathy for the twisted Martha Ivers, because the audience understands how one selfish moment in her youth set her on a coarse she can never change. It has been raining inside her ever since, and will always keeps coming. At the same time, however, we are rooting for the vulnerable Scott, hoping she'll be the victor in a battle she's not sure she can win.Judith Anderson is Mrs. Ivers, little Martha's (Janis Wilson) aunt. She's none too nice and on a rainy night Martha causes her death in the heat of the moment, only her pal Walter (Mickey Kuhn) a witness. They both believe their friend Sam (Darryl Hickman) witnessed the deed, and that knowledge will haunt them and rule their lives for years to come.Nearly two decades later Sam Masterson (Van Heflin) has an accident just outside of Iverstown. It brings back memories of when he was a brash kid, and the girl who now controls both Walter (Kirk Douglas) and the town. He meets the lovely Toni Marachek (Lizabeth Scott) on his first night there and lends her a hand. Fresh from jail and hoping to start over, Toni falls for Sam, but fate may slam the door in her face when his ties to Iverstown come to light.Barbara Stanwyck is the adult Martha, married to the weaker of the boys from her youth, Walter. She always wished it had been Sam who'd stayed that night so long ago, and even when she thinks he's there to blackmail them, she can't help but throw herself at him. She flaunts her feelings for Sam in front of Walter, thinking she has it over on him because he loves her. He may have more courage than she does, however, as their twisted relationship becomes strained further by Sam's return.Heflin is solid as always and this is one of the great neglected noirs of the 1940's. Douglas is very good in his first screen role and Stanwyck's portrayal of the sad and sick Martha Ivers can stand proudly with any she played in the 1940's. Though her screen time is less by comparison, it is Scott who steals this film, however, as Toni is easily the most memorable character. Even when she isn't around, we are thinking about her plight, wondering what will become of her.If you want a really fine print, the Paramount one is the one to go with, but many watchable ones are out there. This is one only for those with PAL compatible equipment, which is mostly outside the US. One of the truly great noirs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KR6D2BYCKTDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000803PAO#wasThisHelpful","R1KR6D2BYCKTDX","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Radio buffs all certainly agree that The Shadow was among the greatest radio shows of all-time. It is often stated that The Shadow began as a magazine, but that is not quite the case. The character of The Shadow originated as the announcer for Street & Smith's Detective Story, a radio show designed to help sale the magazine of the same name. When listeners began calling in requesting ""The Shadow Detective Magazine,"" something had to de done.Walter Gibson brought The Shadow to life for over a decade in pulp-type novels. The Shadow Magazine made its way to the public for the first time on March 6, 1931. There were two of these novels each month and between 1931 and 1949, Gibson, a former magician turned journalist, churned out 283 of the 325 shows, creating Commissioner Weston and many other characters later brought to life on the airwaves.It may surprise some casual Shadow fans to note that Lamont Cranston was originally only one of The Shadow's many personas. Street & Smith wanted to continue The Shadow as the pulp detective of Walter Gibson's novels, rather than the mysterious announcer and storyteller fans had come to love. But their lack of foresight could not kill, The Shadow.Though a transcribed serial production of 15 minute shows originating in San Francisco, with Carl Kroenke as The Shadow, was syndicated and hung around for 10 years, it wasn't until September 26, 1937 that, The Shadow, as we now know him today, returned to network airwaves via the Mutual Broadcasting System. Orson Welles was the ""man-about-town"" Lamont Cranston, using a strange power he had learned in the mysterious orient to cloud men's minds so that his alter ego, The Shadow, could fight crime.While Welles' Shadow was very good, and his stint as The Shadow sent people running to his Broadway production of Julius Caesar in order to get a look at the face of The Shadow, I have always been partial to Bill Johnstone's portrayal of Lamont Cranston. One of my favorite shows ever, The Chess Club Murders, is included here and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.Over the years, Lamont's constant companion, Margot Lane, would be portrayed by Agnes Moorehead, Margot Stevenson, Marjorie Anderson, Judith Allen, Lesley Woods, and Grace Matthews. Margot Stephenson was the beautiful Broadway actress who had actually inspired the character of Margot Lane.This is one of the best collections around of The Shadow, and while by no means definitive, a ton of terrific shows are here to enjoy. Since the individual shows have already been listed, I will only list what I believe are the most enjoyable from each of the three men who portrayed the greatest single figure in the history of radio.ORSON WELLES---Welles was only 22 when he starred in The Shadow. He managed to strike a deal with the sponsor, Blue Coal, which allowed him to do the show ""cold"" without rehearsal. It served to give his performance as The Shadow an edge. Welles would show up a few moments before airtime, perform a few magic tricks for the cast, then bada bing-bada boom, he would grab the script and run with it.What Welles could not do, however, was the signature and sinister laugh of The Shadow. Frank Readick (the voice of The Shadow on Street & Smith's Detective Story) continued to both open and close the program.FAVORITE SHOW---SOCIETY OF THE LIVING DEADBILL JOHNSTONE---He began as The Shadow on September 25, 1938. He had trouble with the laugh also, but finally managed to perfect it. My favorite Shadow.FAVORITE SHOW---THE CHESS CLUB MURDERSBRET MORRISON---He became The Shadow in 1943, was replaced by John Archer a year later, then returned as Lamont Cranston late in 1945.FAVORITE SHOW---A TIE---PREVIEW OF TERROR and THE PHANTOM OF THE LIGHTHOUSEThis great collection comes with a stunningly researched booklet by Anthony Tollin, who uses a number of sources to give a far-reaching look at the history of radio's greatest man of mystery, both in print, on radio, and in film.There are marvelous program notes on each episode included in the booklet, supplemented by photos of many of the key players. For fans of radio, the theatre of the imagination, this Shadow collection is not to be missed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPLBGUNCMZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570195005#wasThisHelpful","R3JPLBGUNCMZ7","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Lundigan had two of his finest ""B"" hours at RKO with Robert Wise's Mystery in Mexico, and the marvelous little film, Follow Me Quietly, directed by Richard O. Fleischer. All the flair and pacing of The Narrow Margin which were soon to give Fleischer his reputation are already in evidence in this terrific ""B"" mystery. Ideas tossed around by Anthony Mann and Francis Rosenwald were crafted by Lillie Hayward into a tightly written screenplay; nice touches of secondary conversations adding color and zip to the main action and plot. Lundigan today gets a bad wrap but in this fun mystery, perhaps even more so than in Mystery in Mexico, you can see it was only the material he was often given which held him back. He's solid and likable here, reminiscent of Alan Ladd.Ann Gorman (Dorothy Patrick) braves the rain hoping to pop in the local police hangout and get the scoop on a strangler the cops can't seem to stop. Lundigan is Lt. Harry Grant, who wants no part of she or her tabloid rag, however. Catching the ""Judge"" as he has been named by the papers is his only priority. The Judge only kills on rainy nights, and it's been raining a lot lately. Grant's frustration comes to a head in this breezily paced mystery when he helplessly watches the editor of a local paper dictate his own final story after becoming the killer's seventh victim to date. There is some nice back and forth between Grant and Ann as she begins to grow on him. An excellent scene where it is Grant who undresses and readies himself for bed after Anne has finagled her way into his apartment is a nice reverse twist which and adds spark to the couple's pleasant romance.With tons of evidence yet no real clues, Grant gets the idea of making a dummy with all the killer's characteristics except a face to aid police in their search. While it sounds corny, it is done quite well and Lillie Hayward's script has a dynamite scene of Grant talking to the life-size mannequin not to be missed. Ann's idea about a magazine dropped at the scene of the eighth victim puts Grant hot on the trail. There is an exciting chase where Grant nearly bites the dust punctuating the mystery, and a very pleasing wrap up for the continuing romance of Harry and Ann. William Lundigan and Dorothy Patrick work nicely together in this one, and Jeff Corey is solid as Lundigan's pal, Sgt. Collins. Marlo Dwyer contributes a nice turn also as a waitress who may have unknowingly served a killer.Nicely photographed by Robert de Grasse, with an excellent screenplay from Lillie Hayward and fine direction from Fleischer, this is an enjoyable way to kill an hour on a Saturday afternoon or pass the time on a rainy night when you can't sleep. Great fun, and the kind of discovery which more than makes up for all the ""B"" films which didn't make the grade. This one gets ten stars where I'm concerned. Fans of the genre who pick this one up will be delighted. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFIXHFV6C3LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DI94HE#wasThisHelpful","R3GFIXHFV6C3LX","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I can be your diary for awhile. Your talking diary.""This love story from Korea has the tenderness of snowflakes carried gently from the heavens on a soft winter breeze. From its sepia-hued opening to its final shot, this film will gently squeeze your heart until you feel the ache of love, and smell its fragrance. Filled with moments of great romantic beauty and heartbreaking sadness, its complex story is told with a simple grace and elegance, making it one of my personal all-time favorites.Kim Ha Neul is endearing as Soeun, a shy college student in love with classmate Donghee. Their story of gradually getting together has a sweet innocence of yesteryear. It is in stark contrast IN (Yoo Ji Tae), whose girlfriend is brash and quarrelsome. He is concerned, in fact, that she may be sliding into alcoholism. But underneath there is a yet untapped depth which will flourish near the end of this story. It is the otherworldly manner in which their paths cross which is at the crux of this film.Souen's life in college consists mainly of visiting the hospital where her best friend, Sumi, is recovering from a broken leg. But late at night, she begins talking on a HAM radio to IN. But the radio, given to her by another student, is reportedly broken, and does not work. Their conversations are at first contentious, she disbelieving of his claim that he is attending the same college, but 20 years later. Much to his girlfriend's displeasure, he makes arrangements to meet Souen. But it is a bridge too far to traverse. Each initially believe the other stood them up. Her continued concern about current events, however, prompts him to give her news of future happenings. It is then that both realize something very special is occurring; they are living in different times.Whereas most films would use this as a device to propel their love across time love story, director Jeung Gueon Kin and photographer Kwang Suck Jung take this in an entirely different direction. Soeun and IN do come to care for each other, however, he becoming her diary for her fledging romance with Donghee, while he wrestles with his girlfriend's drinking, and her skepticism that what he's telling her is actually happening. His sudden realization that his parents are attending college with Soeun leads to a romantically heartbreaking bit of information that changes both their lives forever. It also changes his girlfriend's mind about what has been happening, and she decides to support IN. In an emotionally gut-wrenching scene, he discovers the scent of love still remains. To reveal anything further would ruin the experience for those who have yet to see this piece of film magic.It story unfolds in a deceptively simple manner, its touching depth sneaking up on you at the end. The two most wonderful things about this film are Kim Ha Neul's lovely performance, and the hauntingly beautiful score. A film which takes something from your heart, but gives something greater back. A must see for romantics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPS7AO1PERC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SJ8ZA#wasThisHelpful","R1SPS7AO1PERC7","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Everyone I loved were always just out of reach."" -- Sung-hyun writing to Eun-jooAn achingly beautiful film, its bittersweet tale of love and longing for a happiness perhaps forever out of reach, Il Mare epitomizes why so many are flocking to Korean cinema. Joining films like A Moment to Remember and Ditto of recent times to form a unique genre, filled with a tenderness and beauty heretofore only found in books, Il Mare leaves an impression of images and emotions deeply entwined around our hearts, like flowered vines clinging to a trellis. Once viewed, there is no turning back for the film lover, who will spend much time and energy tracking down the romanticist films of Korea. A lovely and haunting score interspersed with some beautiful jazz selections help create a moving letter of ethereal beauty, as love crosses time only to be kept at arm's length by a gulf too deep to bridge.Titled in lovely Italian for North American audiences, the original Korean title is based on Chinese characters, meaning time-transcending love. The Sea House and Siworae both hold great meaning for all who have seen this delicately layered love story that squeezes the heart until breath comes grudgingly. Directed with great patience by Lee Hyun-seun and photographed with an eye to elegant simplicity by cinematographer Hong Gyeong-pyo, a quiet and magical mood which never wavers is set for lovely Jun Ji-hyun of My Sassy Girl fame, and Lee Jung-jae. A mailbox outside a lonely house at the end of a pier becomes a portal through which Eun-joo (Jun Ji-hyun) and Sung-hyun (Lee Jung-jae) correspond through time itself. Leaving a Christmas card in her Il Mare mailbox, dated Dec 21, 1999, she requests the next resident forward her mail. That simple act will bring her into contact with a puzzled Sung-hyun, who receives the query, but two years earlier, in December of 1997. What follows is a graceful story of love slowly healing wounds and blooming across the gulf of time.Eun-joo is very much alone at Christmas and experiencing the pain of love lost when the rift opens and her first letter arrives from Sung-hyun, who thinks a joke is being played. As in Ditto, small things she knows about the past convince both they've actually found some sort of wrinkle in time. There is joy and laughter when they realize it is the mailbox at Il Mare bringing them together. He retrieves a tape player for her, small presents are exchanged, and a date of sorts is arranged, as each does what is suggested by the other, but two years apart. Red gloves she looked at but did not buy, a bottle of wine he leaves her for their date across time, a dog named cola, and a tree he decorated at Il Mare she enjoyed two years into the future offer very special moments for the couple and the viewer. Eun-joo consoles Sung-hyun when his father dies, and sends him a gift to help him heal. Director Lee Hyun-seun makes marvelous use of a bench at a train station where the two often meet, separated by time, and the train which takes her away, to create an atmosphere of longing for what should be but perhaps is not meant to be.An attempt to actually meet doesn't work, and when she asks Sung-hyun for his help to keep from losing someone, he knows she is the love of his life. A moment of revelation has her racing with desperate urgency to the mailbox to prevent a heartbreaking tragedy. Moving and beautiful, Il Mare will capture your heart and reside there always after seeing it for the first time. Remade in America as The Lake House, the Korean version is a lovely film of poetic beauty. Listings for this film are very murky, but it is available, so make sure you are getting the original Korean language version, with English subtitles as an option. Those with a romantic heart are urged to see Il Mare, and begin their journey into the world of Korean romanticist cinema.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTA9FLE7BPM93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZF9D2W#wasThisHelpful","RTA9FLE7BPM93","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This warm, beautiful, and often magical film from Audrey Wells would surely have been an Academy Award darling if made decades ago, as its tone and message, not to mention performances, fit more into the old-style filmmaking of a Hollywood now long gone. Diane Lane is simply marvelous as a woman whose world is turned upside down by divorce. In an attempt to start her life over and recapture the joy in life, she purchases a run down villa in Tuscany. Audrey Wells, who directed and co-produced the film with Tom Sternberg, also adapted Frances Mayes' book, giving this film the heavenly scent of grapes on the vine and the visual beauty of a field of sunflowers on an Italian hillside.Diane Lane is Frances, suddenly, and quite unexpectedly single again. Wondering how you breathe again when your world is shattered, Lane perfectly captures that stunned feeling of years wasted when a marriage ends. The wind is taken from the San Francisco writer's sails when someone half her age takes her place, which though cliche'd, is often the case. Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy fame lends fine support as Frances's friend, Patti, who refers to Frances's new place as 'camp divorce'. Adrift at sea emotionally, Frances has not moved forward despite having enough cash from the settlement to do so. When Patti experiences a similar heartbreak, she offers her friend the ticket to romantic Italy she can no longer use.Frances feels a change within herself, realizing if she truly is to recover from seeing her world crumble, she must build another one. After a chance meeting with Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a free-spirited former Fellini actress, Frances jumps in with both feet, purchasing a run-down Italian villa called Bramasole. Vincent Liotta is excellent as the kind and decent realtor, Martini, who will become a true friend to Frances. There is an especially touching scene between the two as Frances realizes she has bought a house for which she doesn't have the life. The humorous elements of fixing up a 300 year old house on the hills of Tuscany are handled well by director Wells, adding great charm to a tender story, juxtaposing the ebb and flow of rebuilding a life and a villa. The happily married Martini has great affection for Frances nonetheless, aiding her by finding a group of Polish builders looking for work.The workers become part of her family as she refurbishes both her live and her villa. Pawel (Pawel Szajda), the youngest of the workers, falls in love Chira (Giulia Steigerwalt), the daughter of Frances's next door neighbor daughter, prompting Frances to intercede for her new family member with the girl's disapproving family. A simple white dress becomes a poignant image when Frances rediscovers the joy and excitement of new love with Marcello (Raol Bova), only to discover there is pain in learning to live again. That realization is soon confirmed when a devastated and quite pregnant Patti shows up on her doorstep in need of a shoulder. It is Frances's friend Martini who will come to her rescue again, however, opening her eyes to the fact that all her dreams have actually come true, if only she will use her heart to see them.This wonderful and life-affirming film ends at a wedding reception, proving that unthinkably good things can happen, even late in the game. The warmth and charm on display here is of another era, and was unfortunately scoffed at by many critics. Audrey Wells has made a sweet and ultimately joyful film about the living of life itself. A moist ocean breeze and the flavorful aroma of Italian food as it simmers seem to hang over every frame of celluloid used. Superlative photography from Geoffrey Simpson captures the many colors of Italy, the flag throwing festival where young Pawel tries to win over Chira's parents especially beautiful. Christophe Beck's score seems to fit every mood and situation without intruding upon the scene. Finally, Diane Lane gives a very gentle and old-style performance that fits the tone of this lovely film. Great and wonderful things occur even later in life, and often when we least expect them. That is the lovely message of this film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q6IWPZYMWU37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056SO2N2#wasThisHelpful","R3Q6IWPZYMWU37","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You revel in the joys of fleshly love, don't you?"" -- Rebecca Femm to the horrified, and quite lovely, Margaret WavertonThis wonderful curio from the early 1930's captures all that was best about the old spooky house genre. Director James Whale injected the film with dry, sardonic humor, a dash of romance, and enough thrills to keep audiences in their seats on a rainy night. A hybrid of America and England, it has an odd lineage, and was both successful and a flop all in one go. J.B. Priestley's 1927 novel, Benighted, was actually published in the United States under the title Whale kept for the film. The adaptation to the screen was credited to Benn Levy, but some input was given by R.C. Sherriff. The sophisticated repartee between the characters and the often black humor did not mesh with American audiences expecting perhaps, something closer to Frankenstein. Audiences in England embraced it, however, making it another big hit for the director.As with many of these early 1930's films, one must view it themselves before dismissing or lauding its merits, either as entertainment, or art. Many films during this period which enjoyed a modicum of popularity prove not to hold up with the passage of time. Other films which may have disappeared quickly, have today attained legendary status. Also, many films often given little consideration by today's critics, which were popular with audiences during their initial release, prove quite charming and entertaining still, reenforcing the belief that critics are sorely out of touch with the public. In the case of The Old Dark House, it is the widely held view of classic film fans and critics that England got it right. Fun, humorous, and with a few creaky thrills, it is fabulous to watch it today. The dust on the story is palpable, but only adds a nostalgic charm for today's viewer. The cast includes screen greats, and soon to be greats, making for a delightful escape into another time and place for the moviegoer.On a rainy road in Wales, a dashing former soldier with no means of support, and a married couple are forced to spend the night in a gloomy old mansion when their car is virtually washed into it during the storm. Gorgeous Gloria Stuart is most feminine as the scared wife of Philip Waverton, Margaret. Raymond Massey is her husband, and an agreeable Melvyn Douglas is already displaying the light charm which would carry him through decades of great films, as Roger Penderel.Shelter is sought from the storm also by Charles Laughton. Laughton is businessman Sir William Porterhouse, and Lilian Bond is his platonic companion and ex-chorus girl, Gladys DuCane/Perkins. There to welcome all of the stranded travelers is a gibbering and virtually unrecognizable Boris Karloff as the butler, Morgan. Eva Moore, as Rebecca Femm, nearly drives every one of them mad with her misplaced fervor. Her droll and cowardly husband, Horace, portrayed in winning fashion by Ernest Thesiger, is hiding something as well.To reveal more might ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen this delightful bit of spooky fun. An old mansion lit only by candles, a voice up the stairs, a dangerous butler, and the storm itself create the chills while Douglas and Bond provide the romance. If that isn't enough to warm you to this film, a frightened Gloria Stuart runs around in scantily clad elegance for nearly the entire film! All the players seem to have understood what they were making here, and it shows in their lively performances. A true early 1930's classic, this one is a must see, and perfect with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy night. Terrific fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WALLZSCN0PL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065LK6#wasThisHelpful","R2WALLZSCN0PL3","A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried them all. I was leery about buying a cheapie velcro watch band, but I was desperate... I've had it with my watch twisting to the side & not staying in the center of my wrist. Whether a leather band, stainless steel link, chain link, Euro nylon, my watch face always rotated over to the edge of my wrist. I tried over tightening the straps /bracelets which did keep the watch from twisting, but it also cut off blood supply at my wrist!But this Miltat band is different,...it grabs on the both SIDES of the wrist which keeps it centered. Plus it has a strategic gap in the middle underneath the metal link. This design feature mean there is much less pressure in the sensitive center of the wrist & allowing maximum free-flow of blood thru the surface veins. Love this Free Flow design. Grabbing from the sides keeps the band & watch perfectly aligned on my wrist,.. no rotating or watch band discomfort. Sweet.This is NOT a cheapie timex-type of thin velcro watch bracelet that snags on clothing. I wanted a nice looking, quality band to handle larger face watches with COMFORT. At 48$ I thought was ban was expensive until I felt the c-o-m-f-o-r-t & performance This Miltat turned out to be Great. Installed it my self by popping out the spring loaded straight pins beside the crown. Some watches have their own custom non-standard bracelet connectors & they won't fit. Has to be the standard spring loaded bracelet pins that attache the band to the crown.Beefy & comfortable for larger (42-50m) size watch faces. Top quality and well designed. Good blood supply & no nasty wrist band marks in my skin as wrist expands /contracts with exercise, temperature, etc. . BEST OF ALL, watch face STAYS PUT right in the center of my wrist. Easy on & off at bedtime. Does not snag on clothing. Lays flat around my wrist and under clothing. Refined military ops look but I think passable for use with my dress watches. The brushed stainless steel retainer loop in the middle of the strap is a nice refined touch. I bot the black loop (20$more) but prefer this sand blasted stainless steel retainer loop that was not avail at the time. I own the 24mm, 22mm & 20 mm wide bands & they are all excellent.BOTTOM LINE: Top comfort and performance Highest quality. Best of all, watch face STAYS PUT in the middle of my arm instead of rotating to the side. Friendly Free-flow arm design. EARNS 5-STARS. Highly Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REA9GNX4UIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J93ZNWY#wasThisHelpful","REA9GNX4UIW","A1LG0RB22GV3QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG0RB22GV3QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Took a couple days for my cat to investigate and accept the cat tree. It was interesting to watch how her curiosity led her to 'discover' the tree.  She likes to lay on the platform with the round ball on a string. The two door box is also a favorite that gives her comfort & safety.  Sometimes I'll put the cat onto the platform & we'll play together with that ball,....her paws hanging over the edge knocking it around. Very cute.  I find she's also climbing on other things in the house now as she investigates higher areas.  To me this is healthy & expands her world a bit,.but we do have boundaries where she it not allowed to climb.OTHER REVIEWS REPORT TOO MUCH MOVEMENT. I found that when being used on Carpeting it creates a bouncy trampoline affect by the cats jumping on /off or just moving around the tree.  Works best /more stable on hard wood floors. The tree stand itself when assembled carefully is strong with very little wobble,... especially when placed on hardwood, tile, or other non-carpet flooring. But when I moved it onto some carpeting it was noticeably wobbly due to the soft carpet & spongy carpet pad. The cat was a little reluctant to get back on for a while & had to encourage her a bit. I thought about attaching some round chair /furniture feet to the bottom to stabilize things without reinforcing the weak fiberboard.TIPS FOR ASSEMBLING.  I bot the 28x25 size and overall it's a good value. Assembly though is a little tricky to avoid a wobbly result.A hex wrench come bolts for assembly. First I laid out all the parts, which are clearly marked, to make sure everything was there. The parts list is on the one page instruction sheet.I inspected all holes on the platform boards & Initially, it looked like some of the carpet holes were not drilled. But actually they put a small slit that enlarges when the bolt is forced through it. To make assembly easier I used the hex allen wrench the simply pushed it thru the small slit opening it for easier bolt insertion.When tightening up the bolt heads I used a 3 stage approach to avoid over-tightening and possibly breaking the fragile particle type board,...while also preventing UNDER tightening /wobbly results.  First stage is hand tightening each bolt into a tube. Next  use the hex wrench with the LONG end inserted into the bolt & finger tightened the bolt by twisting the hex wrench finger tight. With the long end inserted it is impossible to over tighten.  Then assemble all tubes on the SAME  level. When all tubes on a level are stage 2 tight, insert the SHORT end of the hex wrench into each bolt head and tighten about 3/4 turn. Careful not to over tighten with the extra leverage.This approach allows me to see the general assembly for each level,...allows time for the carpet to compress during stage two tightening,...which makes stage there final tightening more accurate, snug & avoids stripping the plastic threads in the tube's plastic base.I  assembled the unit carefully adding  stages horizontally on the floor,... near to the final place the cat tree was going to be. Directions warn against moving the completed unit as it could easily be damaged. So the final sliding & minimal lifting was done by grasping the base & never any of the upper stages. By assembling horizontally I was able to go back easily to previous levels and make sure the bolts were still snug. NOTE: When I got to the upper two stages I turned the unit upright as it was easier to assemble the top features in an upright position.I ran into a small problem when installing the three tubes in the base.  Three tubes, two of equal length and a longer tube are installed in the base. The instruction diagram is a bit unclear but with some extra attention you will see what they intend. SO be sure to get these three in the right position. You will find out later if you've got it wrong & have to redo like I did.TIP on 2nd PROBLEM AREA:  A 2nd problem area involves two straight studs threaded on each end (where a hex wrench is not used for assembly). These two studs are a bit short which makes assembly difficult because one tube can only get a few turns onto the stud. To minimize this weakness in the tree, I backed out side of stud so it was not fully seated (gave it a couple unscrew turns with my fingers from being fully seated) which made the other side of the stud longer / more length=more threads available to the other side of the stud for screwing on the opposing tube.Took me about 30 minutes to assemble. It is solid, no wobble, no complaints. This will be a traveling tree, so I'll be disassembling /reassembling from time to time & this tree meets that need nicely.SPECIAL NOTE: One reviewer mentioned  potential dangers of a carcinogen chemicals used in this type of type of press board ( see reviewer  January 26, 2015 By G. Nelson...""boards in this tree are made of MDF, probably bound with formaldehyde resins and other VOCs.."").  I checked into the reviewers concerns by Googling MDF board to get some info. I became concerned the chemical(s) used in MDF board are indeed potentially a health hazard to pets AND humans. So to minimize that, I may paint the open underside board to seal those that  side. But the carpet side isn't practical to paint  without removing all carpeting. Also, as the tree is used & clawed, particles /dust are dug out of the soft board under the carpet & giving up possible toxic dust particles into the air, onto paws, fur and into lungs if the binder in the board is indeed toxic. (There is no health warning on this product.)HEALTH CONCERNS: So, to tried to minimize potential toxins in the materials of this tree,... I opened the box not in my front room but in a safer place away from our living area,....the garage or back porch.  Then  carefully vacuumed each piece front /back, carpet & board sides & also the tubes wound with rope. I used a hepa filter vac so as NOT TO BLOW ANY CARCINOGENS into the air /lungs.  After vacuuming each piece, to help the chemicals dissipate I spread out the pieces in fresh air for several days,...a week in fresh air would have been better. I carefully washed my hands with soap whenever touching the inside of the box, the un vac'd pieces, & especially after assembly. Made sure not to rub my eye carelessly or lips or anywhere until a good hand washing. I choose not to ignore the potential very real toxic chemicals typical in pressed board.BOTT LINE: This ia a good value as compared what I could buy locally. Careful assembly using the 1-2-3 step tightening approach ensured a snug, stable tree. Unfortunately, the materials used in the construction are possible linked to health hazards & strongly sugg using measures to help make it safer.  Generally good engineering features. But because of toxic concerns Earns an overall 3-STARS,....  with serious sugg the manufacturer drop all potentially hazardous materials harmful to pets & humans if there are any, or /and please address reviewer concerns on this issue.Regarding product SAFETY: Armarkat makes the following excerpted statement on the Amazon's product page:  ""Armarkat branded products are designed by professional pet product designers committed to putting your pets needs and preferences front and foremost while using environmentally friendly materials that are harmless to pet and to the pet owners."" Given Armarkat statement the product is harmless & environmentally friendly,...versus a reviewer's experience prompting a toxic review,...review  January 26, 2015 By G. Nelson... I wish the Armarkat would step up & further clarify /address user concerns about possible toxicity & safety of this product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTF4K5ILA7RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BYQ100#wasThisHelpful","R1CTF4K5ILA7RY","A1LG0RB22GV3QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG0RB22GV3QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this set because I kept loosing individual keys from the loose type hex key sets. But I always felt the individual key sets were better & that's why I stayed away from swiss knife type hex keys. Gorilla PROVED ME WRONG!I admit it,...I was I surprised at the quality & performance of Bondhus mfg Gorilla keys. They took away all the YeARS OF IRRITATIONS I had with other stick sets. And to find they were made right here IN THE USA. Sweet!These are top quality tool steel & stronger than the chromed vanadium that I broke last week. Gorillas are tough. They do have rust protection built in,...and they are NOT oily like some hex keys.These keys are average length & there is no ball on the end. Long ball keys are handy for special situations. But if you don't need special extra length or the ball end you can't do better than these. It's not a big expensive tool,.. but it is a TOP VALUE BUY in my book. It simply delivers convenience & performance in a handy size.In a Nut Shell here's what I like:1. These keys have accurate sizing & fit perfectly. They have carefully engineered the edges to just barely soften all the sharp edges which makes each key seat like a glove into place. They don't bind or jam in the hole, after severe twisting,...release nicely. That's fine quality and attention to engineering detail. If it doesn't fit like a glove it means there is something wrong with the hex head, not the Gorilla key. they are dead on.2. My favorite thing is I'll never loose another key. They're all right there in a handy container.3. The Gorilla grip housing the keys is a simple, but very effective design. Not over sized but right sized for housing the keys with a protective, comfortable grip for extra torc turning the keys.4. User Friendly engineering. With all keys closed & in place, there is a handy space /gap under each key that allows your my finger to easily slide under the keys to life out easily. With most competitors, they lie flat against the case & I have to use my fingernail to slide under the end & life the key...tough to do: 1. with short nails, 2: when then the keys are held tightly in place to avoid rotating out unexpectedly. Bondhus engineering solves this often overlooked annoyance.5. CUSTOM ROTATING TENSION FEATURE: Key rotate smoothly 270 degrees. Nice. They were just a bit loose and rotated out sometimes on their own. It was easy to tighten the pivot point to whatever tightness works for you. Another nice feature. So now the rotating tension is perfect.6. The two adjustable steel rotating shafts...one at each end holding keys...is enclosed in a tough nylon design shaped like a pocket knife. So it's not bulky or oversized like some I've seen, but very efficient /effective without being over done.7. Each key is divided by tough nylon spacers that minimize any slop and keep the keys rotating smoothly. This, combined with the grip gap below the keys, mean I can actually pull up an individual key instead of two or three just to get the one I need.8. Made in USA.9. Built to last a lifetime...& did I mention I'll never loose another key??10. For MAX STRENGTH each key is one piece with a loop at the end....not the weaker two piece design. Good attention to detail.CONS: Lettering indicating the key sizes are a little small. Not a big deal, The numbers are small, raised, & the same color as the body which makes it a little hared to see.TIP: I used a Sharpie marker to lightly touch the raised numbers with some permanent black ink and now the numbers jump out at a glance! Black matches the rest of the lettering, too.BOTT LINE: Gorilla has brought solutions and quality engineering to all the hassles with hex keys I've put up with for years,...& I'll never ruin a set by loosing an individual hex key again!!

"I researched until I was purple in the face. This bell is first class. Fit and finish smooth, shiny and ready for action. The large BRASS  dome puts out a clear consistent ring ring. The metal strap connector conveniently handles any size of handlebar. No special measuring necessary.Dome easily unscrews so I can get to the internal mechanism. There is no oil on the moving parts, gears and spinning shafts so I sprayed silicon into the mechanism. That does make it smoother & extends life. Definitely recommend this easy maintenance if you want bell to perform at its peak & last for years.I mounted my bell  on my right handlebar and use my thumb to activate. All the dimensions make it very easy  /convenient to mount and ring safety.

"Aug 12 2015 Update:Had an issue with the motor & had to call cust service. Problem was handled very quickly & efficiently! Thanks!Orig REview:I researched until I was blue in the face because I do NOT like to sweep & I didn't want to buy a problem or a disappointment. Sweeping is a pain & a chore. But to my surprise every time I use this Shark it brings a SMILE! :)Wasn't sure what t to expect with this Shark,...there were some mixed reviews & opinions were  helpful. Since I own several Dyson's including a Dyson 44  (I'm not happy with the D-44 or small storage of the Black & Decker Platinum 20v hand vac)  I looked at buying the dyson59. Glad I chose this Shark,...though nothing is Perfect...& this Shark is not designed for all situations.PERFORMANCE: I don't try to sweep a large house,..its just not designed for that.  It's great for quick, effective clean ups but has flexibility to do larger areas too. Shark give me flexibility to keep my full-size Dyson in the closet much much longer between major cleaning. That's nice. With a cord I have no batteries to run down unexpectedly. Nice. Yes I do have to find an outlet to plug it in, but it's got a very long cord which minimizes that minor annoyance.-The dust /dirt collection cup is much biGGer than the Dyson's I've tried & much easier to dump without a mess. Plus the dirt cup is easily detachable with one hand,..very convenient, well thought out,...a major plus.-The snap connections on the shaft of my portable Dyson are so loose goosey it's like trying to  sweep with a droopy wet noodle & leaks suction. Not fun.-But the Rocket is ROCK SOLID!  The locking couplers on the shaft are very solid w/no loss of suction. No wet noodle feeling at all.  It's a lightweight metal of some sort more durable than plastic.  But I resisted buying Shark for a long time because of the huckster feel to their advertising that made me resist buying. Shark's First Class Quality Engineering surprised me.OTHER PLUSSES:* * *NEW UPDATE.... When I need to store the unit I don't use the wall hook.  Instead of mounting a plastic hook somewhere to hang the Shark, I lean the Sharp upright against the wall as one unit, nothing detached,....with the bottom vac head close to the wall. It's quick, easy, nothing to disassemble, no mounting hooks involved, convent storage anywhere while minimizing  storage space.-Lean Storage works for me because of two small, strategically placed  rubberized feet /knobs on the underside of the dust cup that helps grab the wall so it doesn't slide down. It also creates a 3-point stability  between the 2 rubberized knobs & the sweeper head flat on the floor. In this 3-point position the Shark rests nicely balanced /stabilized with minimal storage space yet ready to conveniently swing into action quickly.-smartHE (smart Handy Engineering).  The  placement of rubber knobs is one example of what I call  smartHE (Smart Handy Engineering)  or smart, handy, practical engineering features that enhance Sharks performance, reduce stress & make it flat out easier /even fun to use. These small rubber knobs do double duty cushioning /stabilizing  the plastic dirt cup when laying the sweeper flat on the floor.  SUGG: would be helpful if Shark could enhance this upright storage feature with some pop-out rubber feet on the sweeper head & larger rubber on the bottom of the dirt bin.The 3-point storage is easy & simply needs a wall /closet etc  to  lean against. The rubber under the dirt cup keeps everything stable & in place,...automatically keeping itself from walking /rolling away from the wall or falling over sideways.  I store it upright  like this even on smooth hardwood floors. Very convenient & gives max flexibility to store it most anywhere out of sight, in an quiet corner, etc..  Nice!  With a little practice  it's easy to catch on to the technique & not have problems of it falling over as some reviewers have mentioned.-Vac performance works great on medium, short carpeting, hardwood floors & tile. Don't have to change height or anything,...just flip a switch that slows the beater brush on smooth surfaces. On deeper pile carpet I go to high speed. I read the directions. Easy Peasy & effective.-***UPDATE: The Sweeper's Headlight was a BIG SURPRISE.  The angle & intensity allows me to actually SEE THE DIRT dirt /dust on my medium dark hard wood floors. Nothing in the marketing describes this benefit, but it's a real help to actually see where I've swept & see the dust  in areas yet to be swept.  NO MORE GUESSING!  As a result I haven't really used  any other attachment yet. The slower brush speed setting for wood floors attracts dirt & smart handy engineering keeps the spinning roller from damaging the wood floor. Never a danger of that.-Bot the motorized animal attachment for cat hair & misc on bedding. I can immediately see the results in the transparent collection container. Use Shark for steps too, but often too lazy to switch the heads & simply use my normal floor attachment for steps too,... with great success.* * * UPDATE... WHEEL NOISE &  HARDWOOD FLOORS: Not an issue for me. The two large wheels have rubberized tread which deaden click clacking over wood /tile floors & superior to all-plastic wheels wheels on most vacs.-The two small spacing rollers on the front of the sweeper head are not rubberized & do make some rolling noise on wood. Some reviews reported the noise was annoying on hard floors but on balance was not an issue for me.* * * NEW TIP:  IF YOU HAVE A BAD BACK or trouble bending over you can wind the electric cord without bending. While standing upright with cord in hand, simply let out enough cord to loop it over the lower hook when draw the cord back over the upper hook then let out enough length to loop under the lower hook & repeat. The cord is flexible yet stiff enough to make this work easily. With a little practice you'll  catch on easily. Works for me.-Does have a nice LOOOONG cord. But I always come to an end somewhere where an just an extra 5 feet would be nice. It's one of those things where LOOOG is never long enough! An extra 5 feet would be handy if it can be safely done.-Durability & Longevity....only time will tell.  But this Shark is starting from higher quality level /features than battery powered units like Dyson44 /59. That higher quality & attention to detail usually translates to durability & longevity.GREATEST STRENGTH: HIGH QUALITY & VERSATILITY.  Does not pretend to be a full size vacuum. But delivers Big time features.  Shark adapts well to most situations /hardwood /tile /medium & short carpet, under furniture & hard to reach places with excellent heppa filtration that's easy to clean & refuse. No special filters to constantly buy. So it's versatile, self contained & easy to maintain filters with peak performance. It is wrist arm intensive so if you're handicapped in those areas you may want to stay with traditional floor sleepers,,,but can always give it a 30 day test /return.-Usually avail at a lower price than battery powered competitors. With Shark there's no limit on run time,...no expensive batteries to wear out or repurcha$e. Just plug & run.-TOO MUCH: Suction & cleaning performance are excellent. Some sweepers I've used have TOO MUCH  suction making it tough to easily move the sweeper across the carpet because it sucks down on the floor /carpet & won't glide.  No problem here w/Shark due to smart engineering that manages the suction well & picks up the dirt. With a little care & technique I can sweep even loose throw carpets without it being sucked off the floor into the sweeper head.  SUGG: it would be nice if Shark had a safety overload pop-out reset switch to protect the head roller & motor if something gets caught in the roller.CONS & More SUGGS: There aren't many. Plastic wall mounting hook is a little weak. But that's not an issue for me since I use the handy  3-point storage for leaning  against a wall in a closet or empty corner out of sight yet close at hand. This makes sweeping quick & effective,...not a big production. An extra 5ft on the cord would be nice. Extra lights on the sweeper head that shine not only to the front, but to the sides for larger viewing area would be nice. Adjust the motor to get rid of the annoying whine. A simple quick wheel lock to keep the unit from rolling away from the wall when storing /leaning it upright.-A larger accessory bag that closes more secure with a couple fabric loops for hanging would be nice. I don't change accessories very often & store them in the handy bag on a hook in my closet.  Some reviewers prefer having all attachments on the shaft at all times, but for my taste that reduces portability & performance which is Shark. Besides,  I can use my big, bulky sweeper if I want all my attachments at my fingertips.* * * UPDATE:  MY CAT ALWAYS  JETS out of the room whenever I start a sweeper.  To my compete surprise,  my cat GRACIE  just calmly sat there watching me sweep away!  Who knew?!  Ha!  SHARK IS CAT ENDORSED... :).BOTT LINE: Brings a s-m-i-l-e every time I use it. Pushing my Shark I feel smart, refined & minimal.  Now when going back & pushing my full sized vac I feel clunky & out of step.  Just sayin.  Unexpectedly gives me a smile & lift on what used to be a chore.  After owning 3/4 Dysons, I finally chose to break away  from all that overpriced hype & poorly fitting cheap  plastic.  It was hard to convince myself to do that.  I know we're just talking about a sweeper here, but the feeling of freedom & discovery was worth it.This shark delivered solutions for all the annoyances that were trapping me with Dyson & other brands. Shark's smartHE  (smart Handy Engineering) features are second to none. Superior  fit /finish, exceptional cleaning performance, versatility, larger collection cup easily removable, smarter design, usually less expensive... this Shark is a winner in my book. Glad I gave it a try.  Our cat Grace is much happier, too.HIGHLY Recommend.

"Guess I'm slow on the uptake.  Took me YEARS to find the right tool for the right job. This tough tool took me out of the Dark Ages changing watch spring bars. I was trying to use jewelers screwdrivers which usually bent, broke scratched the case & band. My thumb nails (which also bent & broke!) didn't work any better,...either did, luck or ignorance.  Finally got to the point it wasn't worth the chance of scratching my more expensive watches. Luckily, ran across this Bergeon tool. Looks like a well made dental tool so I decided to give it a whirl.MY LIFE CHANGED!!!  This is one tough tool that works every time & does NOT bend or break. Looks like its built to last for years,..and new tips are available. Sweet.  The 'V' design tip grabs the bar just right & gives great control when maneuvering the pin & searching for the hole. It takes me much less time to find the blind hole than any other tool I used previously. What used to be a frustrating chore became a quick easy peasy snap!Works great on difficult tight tolerance stainless steel watch bands, leather and MilTat nylon /velcro bands.  Even used it on Curved spring pins which are more difficult to compress & control vs straight pins.  But the Bergeon 6767-Fine tool tames whatever pin I'm handling & makes it a breeze.  I've used the tool on 20mm, 22mm, & 24mm curved & straight pins without a hitch.BOTT LINE:  TOP QUALITY & PERFORMANCE.  26$ & free ship I thought was expensive at first,...but well worth it. Can't think of one negative thing to say... & I've been in some tight spots with this tool. What used to be a tedious royal pain is now  Easy Peasy.  Saved me many trips to jewelers to change bands & they always seemed to add a few scratches in the process!  So I took charge, tooled up & I'm a happy camper.

"This is First Class screwing! After using these once, I tossed out all my other broken tip, bent, hard-to-hold mini Screwdrivers. This Tekton 2976 set is not as cheap as some or expensive as others, but definitely a Good Value with reliable performance.I bot these Tekton's mainly to resize stainless steel watch bands. But I did not want another cheapie set that broke in a pinch or were too small & slippery to grip while screwing. These tips don't bend, break or slip which means no scratches on the watch or bracelet. These are worth every penny.Watch band screws are usually installed by machine so they're in there pretty tight. Removing them by hand pressure is a lot easier with the right tool. This is the right tool. Each screwdriver has a LARGE  rubberized grip that tapers down the shaft to a very grippy hexagonal design closest to the tip. This is really handy for applying & controlling MAXimum torc on the screw,...  especially on a squirrelly watch band thats hard to hold still.When taking links out of my watch band I need two screw drivers.---one to hold the head the other to turn the screw.  So, I still use a cheapie hard-to-hold screwdriver on one side of the band (until I buy a second Tekton set) while using the Tekton to do the power twisting on the other side. Also, on the large end of these screwdrivers is a right-sized smoothly rotating knob that fits just-right in the palm & rotates smoothly giving extra power and control while screwing.In front of the rotating end knob is a slot that goes clear through the handle. This can be used for a handy chord or to hang directly on a nail. By inserting another screwdriver in the slot I can put extra torc in tough screwing situations.This also come with a very nice case. Its a thicker plastic, but not as brittle & take impacts better. The Hinges are strong,...a metal pin in the middle with a hinge on each side which makes it very strong and smooth. Fully opens & lays flat. Best hinges I've seen in a long time. Handy easy grip handle on top. A secure rocker switch opens /closes the lid securely. Every screwdriver has a custom molded place to keep is from shifting in the case. There enough space I carry some extra screwdrivers inside. Sweet! You could also remove the insert and use the case for something else entirely. First Class case that has many handy uses.BOTTOM LINE: These are not pretend screwdrivers. They are tough & refined.  For 10$ & free shipping it's a no brainer. Applying pressure on the tip while power twisting is much easier with this Tekton2976 set. Where other mini-screwdriver tips bend, break or slip, these  Tekton's power through. Comes in a handy case built like a tank. Easily EARNS 5-STARS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W2GXWPV12JJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LQK3VW#wasThisHelpful","R3W2GXWPV12JJM","A1LG0RB22GV3QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG0RB22GV3QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was torn between this SOG  & Fiskars 14in x7.  This SOG was about 70% more expensive  (45$ special sale & free ship) it had some features the Fiskars (26$ free ship) didn't have so I had higher expectations of the SOG.FEATURES: The curved handle is absolutely great! Ruberized won't slip in sweaty /rain conditions. The curve & increasing width toward the bottom allows me to choke up half way comfortably depending on what I'm chopping. Down at the end it's the widest with a nice flare making full-out max chopping very easy vs the straight smooth fiberglass handle Fiskar that's harder to hold onto,... especially in sweaty /wet conditions.  The one piece SOG head /handle is very tough & all one casting. Reasonable balance,... feeling  invincible  with this tough axe.HEAD: Unfortunately the SOG was only fairly sharp &  still needed sharpening right out of the box. Also, the edge was fairly shallow and would not pass thru wood very easily.  I didn't want to hassle with reshaping the face as I'm no expert on sharpening techniques. Chopping thru a one inch semii-hardwood branch was very difficult. The cutting head seemed thick & the edge did not bite into the wood very well. Almost seemed clumsy somehow. Maybe the SOG is best for splitting wood & not outright chopping.Either way the LOw performance head was a deal breaker for me. Actual weight of the SOG is actually a bit more than the Fiskars, though the description numbers are not very accurate in that regard. The Fiskars has a light fiberglass handle & this SOG is solid one piece forged steel.  So I thought the SOG would penetrate better, but no.BOTT LINE: Love the handle on this SOG,... but I returned it  & bot the less expensive straight handle Fishers 14 inch x7 for about 26$. Since I already own the larger 39in Fiskars I know what to expect from the FIskars head design /performance.  Overall his SOG axe earns an Average 3-STARS.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY9SXXT24XW1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU6B5TO#wasThisHelpful","RY9SXXT24XW1O","A1LG0RB22GV3QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG0RB22GV3QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This band is for smaller wrists 6-7 inches. I had to return this and buy the XL size (190mm long). No matter what the length, this band delivers a Great Custom fit that metal bands cannot match for comfort or fit. The extra padding inside the strap makes this very comfortable and watch stays perfectly aligned in the middle of my wrist. No twisting to the side, perfectly in the middle.I've tried them all. I was leery about buying a velcro watch band because the ones I saw were usually on a timex and they were cheap. This 20mm MiLTAT is NOT cheap, but a high quality well made band. No matter how expensive the watch, watches were always rotating to the side & not staying in the center of my wrist. Whether a leather band, stainless steel link, chain link, Euro nylon, my watch face always rotated over to the edge of my wrist. I tried over tightening the straps /bracelets which did keep the watch from twisting, but it also cut off blood supply at my wrist!But this MiLTAT band is different,...with the unique inner comfort nylon pads they grab both SIDES of my wrist & keeps the watch centered. Plus on the inside of my wrist on the soft part where all the veins are at the surface, this band has a strategic gap in the middle underneath the metal link. Unlike all other bands, this design feature means there is little or NO STRAP PRESSURE in that sensitive center of the wrist & allowing maximum free-flow of blood. Even with exercise or hot weather when the wrist naturally expands, this watch strap DELIVERS COMFORT. Love this Free Flow design. Grabbing from the sides keeps the band & watch perfectly aligned on my wrist,.. no rotating or watch band discomfort. Sweet.This is NOT a cheapie timex-type of thin velcro watch bracelet that snags on clothing. With he hi quality band and inner nylon padding it is think,...but in a nice way especially for today's watches. I wanted a nice looking, quality band to handle larger face watches with COMFORT. At 50$ I thought was ban was expensive until I felt the c-o-m-f-o-r-t & performance This Miltat turned out to be Great. Installed it my self by popping out the spring loaded straight pins beside the crown. On another watch I had to take it to a jeweler and that cost all of $5. for them to put on the new band. Some watches have their own custom non-standard bracelet connectors & they won't fit like many of the Invicta watches. Has to be the standard spring loaded bracelet pins that attache the band to the crown.Beefy & comfortable for larger (42-50m) size watch faces. Top quality and well designed. Good blood supply & no nasty wrist band marks in my skin as wrist expands /contracts with exercise, temperature, etc. . BEST OF ALL, watch face STAYS PUT right in the center of my wrist. Easy on & off at bedtime. Does not snag on clothing. Lays flat around my wrist and under clothing. Refined military ops look but I think passable for use with my dress watches. The brushed stainless steel retainer loop in the middle of the strap is a nice refined touch. I chose the stainless over black & but both were available.BOTTOM LINE: Top comfort and performance Highest quality. Best of all, watch face STAYS PUT in the middle of my arm instead of rotating to the side. Friendly Free-flow arm design. EARNS 5-STARS.

"Well this was not a miracle product for me,...but it did help. Sinus were runny at night. Sinuses would fill up and have to get up during the night.  I suspected some sort of low level deep sinus infection years ago caused by a CPAP breathing machine.  The first use of this spray was dramatic. It immediately took my breath away & felt like a mini hurricane in my nasal passages as it grabbed loose flem and helped it drain & coughed out.  Used it morning & bedtime  3 squirts each time, ...3 is the minimal the bottle recomends,....6 squirts the max.After 4 days the sinuses had cleared & sleep was easier. But when I continued using the spray I began two get stuffy again but no flem present. It was as if the spray was trying to do its thing but there was nothing for it to work on any more.  So  I discontinued use to see if my original symptoms returned,.. but no. So I stopped using Xlear & went back to using Ocean nasal spray. Things have been fine ever since & sinuses more normal. So I learned in my case it was not necessary to use Xlear every day forever, & learned to gauge when it is time to stop using it.  None of the reviews  I read touched on that point, so I had to work thru that unexpected  unknown. Did not suffer any of the side affects, diarrhea, skin rashes, etc that some users reported.  Before using I went on-line and researched the side affects of Xylitol ( the main ingredient & a natural sugar substitute some use for baking ) which was an eye opener. Bottle says 'Made in USA"" but  Xylitol actually comes from China. So when ingredients are mixed here that must be what they mean Made in USA. But to be fair to users it should be noted somewhere what ingredients come for China etc I think. The Grape seed extract in Xlear is used as a natural  preservative I believe.BOTT LINE: It did help loosen flem & reduce some sort of inflammation in my sinuses that salt spray did not correct. I am still amazed and wondering how Xlear, which is basically a sugar substitute, helps in the way it does.  Would feel more comfortable if real medical studies would look at this product more closely.

"After reading some reviews, was worried the plastic was brittle & would break easily. After a couple months of use,... no problem. The plastic is tougher than it looks,... but if I go gorilla on it I'm sure I could break it.  I really love this Bosch organizer box with the clear top. The big molded handle is also handy.I didn't buy this 'tray' to fit into a Bosch storage box,...alway intended to use it free standing (there are no latches to lock into the Bosch case system).  What I needed was a solution,... the big draw was the slick design, clear lid, and customizable compartments. Not completely waterproof but water resistant.I was looking for a solution for my big collection of drill bits and other small drill parts. I have drill bits all over the place & it got to the place I couldn't find the right size or type when I needed it. Hiding them inside closed cases just didn't help. Plus I could put everything in one place, easy to see & handy to carry. This clear top was the perfect solution. With the 30 day easy return  I gave it a shot.Large or small, long or short, AT A GLANCE I can see what I need. Real time saver,...and everything in one spot.  Nothing lost, nothing left behind, just toss it back in the bin and ready for the next job. Easy peasy.Will definitely buy another one or two (but on sale). At the current price (about 50$)  that's a steep price for my wallet. Glad to have the one I own. Will buy again on sale @ $28 range & sometimes it drops down to that lower price range on Amazon for a short couple days.  The colorful removable /reconfigurable trays are handy & found things to fill up every one.BOTT LINE: Good solid construction. Plastic  turned out to be stronger than anticipated. The clear top is the real draw for me. Can organize different things easily.  When my wife spotted the case  she tried to  sneak-steal it for her sewing stuff!

"Serious USB 3.0 S P E E D!  A big diff over USB 2. Comes formatted to use right out of the box on both Apple OS or PC.  No need to reformat under normal circumstances at all. Sweet. This thumbD delivers speed, advanced protection, reliability, fair price.On my Apple MacPro I had problems using this Traveler with the other USB port occupied. The close USB port layout on the MacPro & the fatter profile of this Traveler's special thick, protective soft rubber shell prevents me from plugging in two thumbs or a USB printer cord side by side.So  I use a thumb extension chord with a low profile USB plug wire that provides an extra 4 to 8 thumb drive ports. This gives max flexibility for any USB usage. If you have a USB printer or other USB devices needing the second Mac laptop port, you'll have to use a USB extension or other methods to provide multiple USB usage.  So the fatness of the Traveler is a bit of an inconvenience but its features are WELL WORTH  a little reconfiguring to make it work with other USB devices. I prefer laptops that have 4/5 USB's on diff sides of the case to eliminate this type of thing.TIP:  I bot a super slim DTGE9 8GB USB 2.0 from Kingston made in Taiwan that's super slim & can  use both ports at the same time side by side.The DataTraveler also has an unattached rubber cap. In the product picture, it's actually on the right end of the thumbD. The cap completely seals the entire metal nose. Soft rubber, not hard plastic, designed to absorb shock, keep out dust /dirt & water. I've submerged this USB under running water & it is completely water proof.  Nice!There is a slot at the end if you want to attach a lanyard,...nice touch. Unfortunately a lanyard is not included.BOTT LINE: This is a quality package that brings confidence & performance to a sometimes sketchy thumb drive world.

"Have used these for years & have confidence in Fisol. Designed not to release in stomach /avoids annoying fishy burp up. That's 95% true. Sometime I take them on an empty stomach & get a very modest burp back. But that's more my fault. Have recently been trying Dr Tobias optimum omega 3 with good luck. Tobias is higher potency in each pill, also larger quantity less cost, same quality.  Prices vary on both products so you have to watch. Three of these Fisol pills is equal to one dr tobias fish oil pills. Tobias is easier for me to swallow & Never got a fishy burp up. Tobias is a little more expensive usually. So right now I am taking both & comparing both.Its nice to have choices.  For some reason the oblong shape of tobias is easier to swallow vs the round /oval shape of the Fisol. But that's just me. Both have the same anti-fishey burb-back pill coating. It's really a matter of cost per dosage. Tobias at 22-24$ shipped is beginning to get my vote.BOTT LINE: Fisol EARNS 3-STARS. Am always re-evaluating choices. Fisol is a Good product I've taken for years. A competing product dr tobias fish oil is giving Fisol a run for their money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5QTSTOMMCU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HYLCRM#wasThisHelpful","R2B5QTSTOMMCU5","A1LG0RB22GV3QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG0RB22GV3QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This massage design delivered great relief & wanted to rate it 5-stars. UNFORTUNATELY,....developed an annoying squeal inside the motor housing in the first couple days. Had to return. Specifically bot a Panasonic brand for high quality,...but not the case with this one. Other than that defect, the design was excellent. I only ran it on the Low speed that was just fine on my pelt,...Didn't need the hi speed setting or a variable speed that some reviewers creatively rigged up for their vibrator.  But  a variable speed dial in the handle would be a great feature for everyone.The two green wheels & triangular knob seemed strange....at first.  But they work very well & transmit the vibration in different ways for different applications. Rolling that vibration down the legs and across the backs is just great. The long, curved handle reaches areas all over my back with no problem. The triangular knob really comes into play when doing around your heel.There is also a 4th curved surface you can't see in the picture,... on the back of the curved vibrating head. This surface is designed for softer areas like the side & arch of your foot,...and works very well. It reduces the intensity. broadens the vibration zone & curved shape that fits like a glove into curves on the bottom of the foot.A  warning in the instructions says Do Not leave the massager plugged in after use. What's that about? Is it going to catch on fire or something? Seemed a bit strange.BOTTOM LINE: Even though my unit was defective & returned,  I did not want to 1-Star it. The Pana EV2510K is a smart, effective design delivering GREAT results! But quality control is a question. I may wait a while until a new shipment arrives to try it again.  EARNS 3-STARS.

"I've probably tried 3 or 4 different types of hex wrench sets and there was always something where they came up short in actual use.I have hex sets that fold out like a knife. But those are awkward if you do any amount of twisting,...you have to twist the bulky handle that houses all the other folded wrenches. I've had sets with no ball on the end and yes they do get the job done but you've got to make sure  the hex is inserted directly into the bolt or problems when turning. Sometimes that's not possible.These hex ball ends dynamite. Well engineered with a great case with helpful features. These Tekton's are perfect for fitting into any situation where a straight in attack is not possible. Comes with both the metric & english sizes in their own case with sizes clearly printed on the hinged fold out flat case. Nice!  Best case I've ever seen for hex wrenches. Plus the wrenches are a little longer than standard hex wrenches which makes life easier in most situation.BOTTOM LINE: I paid 19$ retail for metric set only. To get BOTH Metric/English for less & free shipping  is a nice bargain.

"I'm not sure why, but Fodor's doesn't usually come to mind when I am looking for a travel guide.  To me at least, Fodor's guides have traditionally been a bit stuffy and honestly a bit ... boring.  Of late, however, Fodor's has managed to hit the sweet spot of being informative without being encyclopedic, including useful and attractive maps and pictures without sacrificing content, and providing tips and suggestions for readers of all budgets (although still tending toward the upscale).Fodor's London is no exception.  This guide is informative yet fun to read; it has useful information on everything from classy museums to activities for kids, fancy restaurants to pub crawls, transportation to London slang.  The food and lodging suggestions are extensive, and while they tend toward the expensive (the ""cheapest"" lodging category seems to be less than 100 pounds--$150 and under, in other words--which would hardly be considered ""budget"" for most travelers) they still try to include all price ranges.  For me, the TripAdvisor quotes are a bit gimmicky (if I wanted TripAdvisor quotes, I'd just go on TripAdvisor!) but provide nice little soundbite perspectives on each place.  Overall, however, this is both an attractive and extremely useful guide--I will be in London again this summer and I plan on taking this along, in addition to Rick Steves' guide (my usual standby for Europe).If you haven't used Fodor's before, give this guide a shot ...

"(Caution: some spoilers ahead)I thought the first 200 or so pages of The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet were absolutely brilliant: Mitchell succeeded precisely by dismissing any suspicions or expectations that his story would be a reheated version of the novel that--for better or for worse--has become the archetype of historical fiction written about Japan by non-Japanese: Shogun.  Where Shogun is expansive, Thousand Autumns starts off delightfully claustrophobic; whereas Shogun's protagonist quickly becomes a Japanophile, gains entry into the inaccessible and the exotic, and sets off on a series of adventures, Thousand Autumns' protagonist is--although intelligent and likable--clearly out of his element, lacking in power amongst his own people let alone a foreign race, and more observer than participant.  By creating a story about Dejima (rather than ""Japan"" per se) that is both as inward-looking and in-between worlds as that tiny island, Mitchell quickly finds his own voice and creates a unique story very different than Shogun and focused on universal and timeless issues like race, power, and faith.  Looking back, I found the beating of Sjako--the reasons for it, the reactions to it--in many ways to be among the most impactful and passionate sections of the entire book: full of deeper meaning, demanding of the reader's introspection, and--brilliantly, and unconventionally for this genre--having completely nothing to do with ""Japan"".Then, abruptly, Mitchell abandons his sympathetic protagonist and the nuanced confines of Dejima (the island becomes a character in its own right) for a good 200 pages to focus on the Orito-in-captivity story.  If the first part of the novel was an interesting expansion of The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing from Cloud Atlas, the second part was an oddly flat retelling of An Orison of Sonmi-451 from the same tale, without the nuance or deeper meaning.  I found myself bewildered by Enomoto and the infanticide plot line ... it touched upon some of the recurring motifs of faith, power, and oppression but not in a convincing or compelling manner.  Enomoto feels like a cardboard cutout villain, the ""good guys"" like Orito and Ogawa are oddly impotent and less interesting as main protagonists compared to the supporting roles they previously held, and the whole strange storyline seemed to drag on unnecessarily long.  Moreover, despite being set in ""normal"" Japan with a cast of Japanese characters, the whole part felt jarringly un-Japanese.  The setting could have been a monastery in Europe, the characters talked, acted, and thought distinctly in a European fashion despite clumsy attempts to ""orientalize"" things.  Creating a believable world and realistic characters doing reasonable things in it is a big challenge with historical fiction, and Mitchell is usually spot-on in this regard; in this case, it just did not come together or ring true.I was happy to get back to de Zoet in the last third of the novel, but this new de Zoet felt more like someone out of Clavell's tale: heroic, powerful, master of Japanese language and custom.  Mitchell wrapped up loose ends fairly well and adopts a somber tone of melancholia suitable for the final plot twists and turns ... but at the end of the journey, he still leaves the reader feeling a bit unfulfilled.Most of my comments about the book have been fairly negative.  Yet, it was a page-turner; even when I could see where Mitchell was going, I still enjoyed being taken along for the ride.  de Zoet was, overall, an interesting and thoughtful protagonist.  Yet, it just seemed fairly predictable and conventional in the end--it was like eating a meal that is good enough, but you keep waiting for that extra little something to make it special and memorable.  Perhaps Cloud Atlas just raised my expectations too high--honestly, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought Thousand Autumns was his earlier work, not Cloud Atlas.  After all, in the latter, Mitchell essentially weaves together *six* historical fiction novels (some of the ""history"" just happens to be in the future).  In comparison, this just feels a bit less ambitious and lacking in its ability to live up to its potential: Mitchell had a chance to transform the genre; instead he seems to just conform to it.  Cloud Atlas grabbed my heart and stimulated my brain; Thousand Autumns kept me more or less entertained, but the fact that I did not end up enjoying it as much as I truly hoped I would left me feeling a little betrayed and disappointed.  I debated between three and four stars, but decided to round up in the end--not a bad novel by any means, but perhaps a victim of my lofty expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQ2JXGVCM0SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812976363#wasThisHelpful","RSQ2JXGVCM0SZ","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cloud Atlas is not perfect by any means (I'll get to what I see as its main flaws in a minute) but credit must be given where credit is due: it is the most ambitious, thought-provoking, entertaining, and imaginative work I've read in a good while.  To do a review of it justice, certain ""spoilers"" must be revealed below ... so let the reader beware.In my description above, I intentionally used the word ""ambitious"" first.  When ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"" is chopped off mid-sentence after just a couple dozen pages and we are transported abruptly to 1930s Belgium, the reader knows that he or she is in for a long, roller coaster of a ride.  Each of the six stories begins in medias res, in fact, and in almost every case, the stories use dialect and are in a context foreign enough that it takes real concentration and focus on the part of the reader to follow along.  Mitchell, after all, has something important to say, and in return for revealing his wisdom, he expects the reader to put some effort into reading his work.  Each story, while a different genre, is remarkably rich in detail--one of Mitchell's strengths is the ability to so thoroughly and convincingly create a universe and characters that the reader feels as if he is strolling along the drafty corridors of Chateau Zedelghem with Robert Frobisher or at sea in the cramped ""coffin"" (cabin) of Adam Ewing.  In fact, for the first half of the novel, one finds oneself acclimating to one world only to be transported to another just as soon as they have adjusted to the first.  Certain sentences and passages are left untranslated or unexplained.  One either finds his exhilarating or frustrating.  As others have noted, this work is not for everyone--if you are looking for a ""fun"" read, or one that has only one level of meaning, look elsewhere.  But for me, I found myself in the ""exhilarated"" camp.  Diving into these rich, diverse worlds, trying to understand how they all fit together, gradually piecing together the puzzle of Mitchell's meaning ... Mitchell creates an adventure where the journey is as thrilling as the destination (each story, and the novel as a whole, tends to follow the pattern of a journey or quest).  What is Mitchell's message?  I'll let you read the book to find that out, but it is one that becomes clear as one reads the book ... and is even explicitly spelled out at several points (notably the last few pages of the Sloosha's Crossin' and Adam Ewing stories).  Personally, having the message so explicitly written out was a bit heavy-handed and unnecessary for me--it was as if, having brought the reader along this far, Mitchell was afraid that the reader might leave without fully grasping what he was trying to say.  Which, again, I felt was unnecessary given that the message was clear anyway--an author should not have to say ""here's what it all means, folks!"" if he has effectively conveyed the message through the story being told (which he has in this case, if the reader is attentive and committed to understanding the work).The message is indeed profound, and important.  However, another annoyance is how overtly and self-consciously Mitchell trumpets just how profound and important his message is; apotheosis is reached with the Robert Frobisher character's creation of the Cloud Atlas Sextet, which seems to be only a thinly-veiled metaphor for Mitchell's own creation.  There are a number of self-conscious and self-referent moments that feel like a jarring breach of the fourth wall in an otherwise elaborately staged production.  At these times I just wanted Mitchell to let his work speak for itself and its brilliance to be judged by the reader.  Other flaws: although I enjoyed each of the six stories, some worked better for me than others--I felt that while all started brilliantly, only some finished brilliantly.  Despite my grumblings about the Mitchell-Frobisher links, I found the psychological intensity of the Frobisher character to be remarkable; once I penetrated the dialect, Sloosha's Crossin' was rewarding as the first step in really tying everything together (as the other bookend to the story, I enjoyed Adam Ewing for the same reason).  To this day, the most haunting and memorable story for me was that of Sonmi-451.  The interrogatory style, the brutal satire of democratic capitalism through the portrayal of ""corpocracy"" as a near-future vision of the path we are on, the deceptions within deceptions and chilling revelations ... I felt that in terms of the plot, characters, and message it was perhaps the best of the lot as a self-contained story in and of itself.  Other stories I enjoyed, but did not find quite as moving: Luisa Rey was fun as a hardboiled crime/detective novel (and a nice setup for the corpocracy of Sonmi-451) but felt a bit forgettable otherwise; for me, at least, Timothy Cavendish struggled to find the right balance between humor and seriousness.  Of course, others will find other stories more or less gripping than me, that is the nature of this kind of genre-bending work.Despite these complaints, I really did love Cloud Atlas despite its flaws.  This was the first book of Mitchell's that I have read, but it has led me to seek out others.  I greatly admire his ambition, his willingness to place expectations on the reader, his ability to create a rich world and complex characters to inhabit them, and his lack of fear in putting a message in his books and making his reader THINK.  I would probably give this book 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 if I could, but I give no hesitation in my 5 star review: even if Mitchell occasionally falls short of his ambitions, bravo to him for writing real literature in an age where the bestseller lists are topped by the likes of Fifty Shades of Grey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMQSI2KY3VUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812984412#wasThisHelpful","RAMQSI2KY3VUF","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost didn't pick up this book, with its dull ""Tokyo on Foot"" title ... which, in addition to being pretty generic, isn't even accurate--as we learn in several amusing anecdotes, this is actually ""Tokyo on Bicycle""!  However, the whimsical sketches on the front and back cover grabbed my attention, and as soon as I started flipping through the pages I was hooked.  I lived in Japan for two years, one of them in Yokohama (so I am quite familiar with Tokyo), and this captured the experience of living in the Tokyo area perfectly: hunched over grannies, aggressive insects, old bicycles, expensive fruit, taxi drivers, police officers who seem to strive to be either your best friend or worst enemy, a mix of curiosity and suspicion toward the gaijin who actually are *living* in Japan as opposed to simply passing through as tourists, etc., etc.  One of the only major omissions I can think of that a resident of Tokyo will notice is the absence of trains, subways, etc. (this is ""Tokyo on Foot""/by bike, after all).Note, however, that this is not really the ""tourist's Tokyo"".  The fact that this book starts off in nondescript Machiya (an area of Tokyo warranting only a few scant sentences even in the Japanese language version of Wikipedia) should be a clue.  If you pick up this book hoping to see sketches of Meiji Shrine, the Imperial Palace, or Asakusa's Sensoji Temple, you will be sorely disappointed.  Likewise, this is not the traditional culture connoisseur or otaku's guide to Tokyo--no tea ceremonies or kimono, and anime/manga make only a brief appearance.  As a result, while I think this book will be of interest to anyone with an interest in Japan, I think this will be of the most interest to people who have experience living in Japan, the Tokyo area in particular (although much will be familiar to people who lived in other parts of Japan, particularly the urban areas).  The author shines in his attention to the little details and everyday events that combine to make up that sometimes-thrilling, sometimes-frustrating, never-boring experience that is living in Japan.  For such people, this book is a 5-star experience--it will bring back vivid memories of your time living in Japan (and for the artistically inclined, it will likely leave you kicking yourself for not thinking of doing this book first!).  For those who have been to Japan only on short trips as tourists, 4 stars: I'm sure this will still be enjoyable, although many of the details will go unappreciated.  For everyone else, depending on your level of interest in Japan, this may or may not be of interest--flip through a few pages first, and I imagine you will either be hooked (if so, buy it!) or bored (if so, move on!).Personally, for me as a former ""gaijin-in-residence"" and Japanophile longing for an opportunity to go back, I found this book to be delightful and I poured over the details and the maps as I reminisced about my days living in Japan.  There are many books on Tokyo and Japan in general, but this is a truly unique and special work ... I am glad to have the chance to add it to my bookshelf, and am happy to recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TB1UJBSNK00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4805311371#wasThisHelpful","R3TB1UJBSNK00","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that Zinn's ""people's history"" is best appreciated and understood as a reaction to U.S. history as it is traditionally taught and consumed--a bloodless, classless, inevitable march toward equality and progress led by heroic Great Men.  ""A People's History"" adds much needed nuance and balance to this perspective.  Progress has been made, but often each generation fights the same battles (with the same outcomes) as the previous one--history is as much cyclical as it is linear.  Far from being classless, class struggles and inequality have always been a part of our history.  Progress was most often made not by but rather in spite of the ""Great Men"" (who were indeed usually men, and often of the wealthy and Caucasian variety), who usually fought to protect their own interests through any means necessary; in other words, the Great Men were usually not so ""great"" upon closer examination.This can seem to be a grim and cynical perspective, until and unless one realizes that this nation has many great attributes and has done many great things (consider that a book like Zinn's would not even be possible in many, if not most, countries), but that what progress has been made has been accomplished through the blood, sweat, and tears of average Americans who have been skeptical of government and the interests of the privileged classes, and speak truth to power.  Personally, this is actually rather uplifting: that far from being ""God-given"", most of our rights and accomplishments have been given by no higher power but rather earned by ""We, the people""--ordinary folks like you and me.  This also means that any future progress will also need to be earned through hard work and a clear vision.  It also means that those who cannot remember the past--or, do not know the past--are doomed to repeat it, especially given that the past, as written down in the standard historical accounts, is often written by those who would prefer its readers to have a very selective memory and knowledge of it.If Zinn's book were the only book on U.S. history, I could see the perspective of critics who point out that Zinn too has a selective and somewhat idiosyncratic focus.  However, as a *counter-balance* to traditional accounts (which typically have the opposite biases and focuses) Zinn's book is a much needed and eye-opening account.  I would go so far as to say that every U.S. citizen should read this before they leave high school, cast their first ballot, and take their first step into adulthood.  Personally, regardless of one's politics, I think a healthy skepticism toward those in power is important for any citizen to hold, and that true patriotism is not blind reverence toward a government or a flag, but rather informed commitment to this country's people and the common ideals that we hold (which outweigh the differences we have, which themselves are often exploited by those in power to divide and conquer).  This is the message that pervades ""A People's History"", and makes it a book I highly recommend--read it with an open mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H9SKG1KHAGR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060838655#wasThisHelpful","R2H9SKG1KHAGR0","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Narrow Road to Oku is one of the classic works of Japanese literature, and Basho is one of the masters of the haiku poetry form.  Although haiku is known in the West primary for its ""5-7-5"" pattern of syllables, it is considerably more nuanced and rule-bound than this (ironically, however, the 5-7-5 ""rule"" is occasionally broken).  For this reason, I would recommend reading about haiku a bit first, if this is one of your first forays into the genre.  I personally wish the introduction had spent some time discussing this form of poetry, as even just a brief discussion of such key features as kigo (""season words"") and kireji (""cutting words"") would have been very enlightening (especially for people familiar with Japanese, given that this is a bilingual edition).What might surprise the reader is that The Narrow Road to Oku is more prose than poetry, as it is essentially a travelogue and journal.  In rather succinct and yet evocative prose, Basho captures many emotions that will be familiar to the traveler and likely to inspire wanderlust: sorrow at parting with friends, excitement at setting out on the road, admiration of sights seen on the road and acquaintances made, contemplation of ages past, and joy at returning home.  Basho's haiku serve almost to both summarize and elevate the prose.  For me, I found his reflections on nature and on ""mono no aware"" (the pathos of impermanence) to be the most compelling.  Personally, I found the passage where Basho finds himself weeping, unaware (and unconcerned) about the passage of time as he considers the famous battle by the Koromo River and composes a pair of haiku (""The summer grasses ..."" and ""In the verbena ..."") equal to the famous poem by Tu Fu (""Countries may fall ..."") to be among the most gripping.  Perhaps because he is capable of such moving passages, one is even more struck by the range of his observations, which are not always so lofty--Basho's haiku about the horses urinating, perhaps because it comes right after the deeply profound passage I mentioned before, is particularly striking.  As enjoyable as Basho's prose is (the opening passage--""The months and days are the travelers of eternity""--in particular), the poetry is simply fantastic--at the risk of sounding greedy, I was left wishing that Basho had included even more haiku poems.Note, however, that this work will not be for everyone.  Basho and his intended audience are steeped in a culture, history, geography, and set of literary allusions that is quite removed from our own--as Donald Keene alludes to, this can be a barrier for a modern Japanese reader, let alone a Western one.  Moreover, the haiku themselves vary in their accessibility: some feature wordplay that is difficult to capture in translation, and most rely on a particular poetic, geographic, or historical allusion, limiting some poems' universality to some degree.  Keene does an admirable job translating these poems, but especially for those of us who can read Japanese, it is easier to see that despite his best attempts something is still lost in translation at times.  Some of this is due to the nature of the work (although, there were a number of times where I wished that the footnotes were a little bit more copious), others are due to the translation.  Keene is a master translator, and overall his translation is quite good--my quibbles are mostly minor, and deal more with style than substance.  For example, Keene seems to have a tendency to add words to Basho's haiku ... which often provide more context but sometimes with the drawback of changing the flow and focus of the poem a bit (especially when he chooses to add verbs--most of Basho's poems have just one verb, if any at all--Keene often will add another verb or two to try and clarify the action, although sometimes this adds ""action"" where there is none in the original).  Sometimes word choices are a little strange (if I could not read Japanese, I admit I'd have had to consult a dictionary to understand what the ""staling"" horses were doing), and he can be a bit inconsistent when deciding whether to translate (versus simply romanizing) place names; again, though, this is a very difficult task--as a place name often has at least one ""meaning"" in addition to simply being the name of a place, and that meaning is often key to understanding what Basho is writing about.  Keene also must make some difficult decisions in translating Basho's prose, which tends to be very succinct and almost a little terse--yet, it can also feature rather long sentences made up of these short phrases.  In English (and even modern Japanese) these would be run-on sentences, so Keene often creates many more sentences than Basho has in the original (e.g. the opening passage, ""The months and days ..."" is but 4 sentences in the original; I count 15 in the translation!).  Again, I do not envy Keene this difficult task, and overall I think he does a great job in his translation.  However, I think he probably also has left the door open for improved translations in the future.Although I nitpick a bit in the preceding paragraph, this particular version has much to offer.  I love the fact that this is a bilingual version--if you are a student of the Japanese language, it is great to be able to compare the translation with the original (and again, despite Keene's best efforts, Basho--like most poets--is still best appreciated in his own words).  If you are competent in modern Japanese, reading Basho in the original is actually not too difficult most of the time (especially once one gets accustomed to the old kana usage, and the kireji such as ""ya"" and ""kana""), and is quite illuminating.  If you cannot read Japanese, it goes without saying that the bilingual aspect will not be of much value, other than perhaps aesthetic value.  Speaking of aesthetics, regardless of your language skills, the beautiful kiri-e (collages) by Miyata Masayuki will be appreciated by all.Overall, this is a loving edition of a Japanese masterpiece.  The original work is outstanding, the ability to refer to the original is invaluable for the student of Japanese, the translation is expert, and the collages are the whipped cream and cherry on top.  All in all, while not quite perfect, it is still most likely the version to beat.  Moreover, this is a work that, although short, should be lingered over and also re-read.  Despite the reader's remove from Basho's time and place, it remains a pleasure to read today; especially if you are interested in haiku and/or the Japanese culture and literature, definitely pick it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNSZXEXC6OS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4770020287#wasThisHelpful","RJNSZXEXC6OS0","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wyoming might be the USA's least populous state, but it is easily one of the most beautiful.  This Moon guidebook does Wyoming justice, with approximately 750 pages full of great information and insights.  Despite its size, this guide is remarkably easily to use and Don Pitcher's writing style is both informative and honestly fun to read.  We moved to the southeast corner of Wyoming a couple of years ago and this guide has been our bible for our explorations of this state.  Although this guide is 6 years old, we have not encountered any difficulties using it--the biggest caveat would be that, given its age, eating and sleeping options are not very up-to-date (but this is a problem easily remedied using TripAdvisor and other similar websites).  Otherwise, the detail is honestly amazing--easily more thorough than many guidebooks I've used for entire countries let alone a single state.Moon is probably not as well known as other guidebook series such as Lonely Planet, Frommers, etc. but I have been consistently impressed by the quality of Moon guides--they have become my default option for North and Central America.  I really hope they decide to update this guidebook, as it is an absolute gem.  I see that there is a combined Montana and Wyoming guidebook that Moon put out in 2011 ... but it has only about 200 or so pages specifically on Wyoming.  As a result, if you are concentrating your focus on Wyoming, I definitely recommend this 2006 Wyoming guide even though it's a bit older.  Its attention to detail just can't be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4V3XZA8GHV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BWQ5OK#wasThisHelpful","R1M4V3XZA8GHV7","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the difficulty of writing a travel guide for the world's 3rd largest country by population and 4th largest by land mass--in only 500 pages!--I think this book does a pretty good job of hitting the highlights.  Its coverage of cities is better than that of more nature-oriented areas, but even still there are no major omissions that I can see (although the coverage given to some sights is limited to just a page or two, regrettably).  The suggested itineraries are relatively reasonable, although some try to cram too much into a short amount of time.The bigger question is: who would find a 500 page guide to the USA most useful?  I think the answer would be people in the early idea stage / preliminary planning stage, especially non-Americans (or perhaps Americans who are very unfamiliar with the country outside of their own home region).  I could see a Briton or Australian who knows that they want to spend a couple of weeks in the US, but is not entirely sure where they want to go, finding this guide the most useful, as it gives a nice overview of the country--with nice pictures and a decent amount of information--to inform their choice.  I would give the guide 4 stars for that purpose.I think its second-best usage would be as an on-the-ground guide for someone (American or not) doing a whirlwind trip of the US where they will spend a short amount of time in a large number of places (especially if those places are the major cities).  For someone just spending a day or two in a handful of places--hopping from Boston to New York to Philly to DC in two weeks, for example--the relative lack of depth in coverage for each place will not be a major issue.  I would give the guide 3.5 stars for that purpose ... I'd rather have the regular Lonely Planet guide even for this purpose, as it has more information.For anyone else, however, I cannot recommend this book very highly.  Your average American, in particular, probably already has an idea of a specific region or city where they'd like to travel: the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, Florida, etc.  In that case, getting a guidebook that is specific to that region or city would be the most useful (personally, I think the Moon guides are some of the best regional- and city-guides for the USA).  If, for example, I was traveling to Boston and Cape Cod for a couple of weeks, I can't think of a good reason why I'd bring along this book instead of just a Cape Cod and/or Boston guidebook.So, in summary, this guide will be useful for some people but not terribly helpful for most.  If you're thinking of traveling to the US from overseas and are still in the idea stage, I think this could be quite useful.  For people already more familiar with the country, or who know what part of the country they're going to visit, a guide that's more targeted to that particular location would be best.  In the end, I struggled with how many stars to give ... I'll give this guide the benefit of the doubt and give it 4 stars, as I think it could be quite helpful for a particular audience--just make sure it fits what you need before buying it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7PB67EMGT69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=174220001X#wasThisHelpful","RC7PB67EMGT69","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Miracle of Mindfulness"" is the fourth book of Thich Nhat Hanh's that I've read, and it provides a straight-forward, ""how to"" guide for achieving mindfulness.  If you're like me, if you read the sutras or books on Buddhism by such enlightened people as Nhat Hanh, you find yourself thinking: this makes sense and is quite inspiring and enlightening ... but how exactly does one ""be"" Buddhist or ""do"" Buddhism?  Buddhism can at times seem rather esoteric and abstract; what makes ""The Miracle of Mindfulness"" so eye-opening is that Nhat Hanh provides quite explicit and concrete activities and exercises for being awake and being aware.Of course, this is easier said than done ... and Nhat Hanh is writing to an audience he presumes is already familiar with the basics of Buddhism ... so despite this short volume's deceptive simplicity, I personally do not know if this would be the best preliminary introduction to Buddhism.  Personally, I might start with a work such as his ""Peace in Every Step"" or Steve Hagen's ""Buddhism Plain and Simple"" and then consider reading this book.  Then, somewhere along the way, definitely read Nhat Hanh's ""The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching"" to better understand some of the key Buddhist concepts such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, and also read some sutras--I think that Red Pine's translations and commentaries on the Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra are quite good.All of the texts I mention are worth reading and re-reading, but of them, ""The Miracle of Mindfulness"" is probably the most explicit and straight-forward ""manual"" for not just understanding but actually practicing Buddhism.  I highly recommend reading it and practicing what is written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUV0HX7Z7O2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807012394#wasThisHelpful","R2KUV0HX7Z7O2Y","A2UN4S3N7VYLEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UN4S3N7VYLEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Cats are not mere pets. They are the rightful descendents, in all their furry glory, of the Cat Goddess. As your cat sits quietly curled on her favorite cushion, observing the world through half-closed eyes, remember that ancient wisdom is the heritage of this eternally mystical creature.” – From the companion bookThere’s a handful (or two) of feline Tarots on the market, but by far the best of them is the Mystical Cats Tarot by Lunaea Weatherstone and Mickie Mueller.Rather than anthropomorphisizing cats or merely posing them in Rider-Waite-Smith scenarios and stances, the creators took on the challenging task of portraying them in alignment with their varied natures: curious, mischievous, playful, mesmerized, predatory and—of course—lounging.Some of the 22 Major Arcana have been renamed (I’ll list them later) and the 16 Court Cards become Kitten (Page), Tom (Knight), Queen and King. The 40 Minor Arcana cards are divided into clans: Fire (Wands), Sea (Cups), Sky (Swords) and Earth (Pentacles). Weatherstone says of the four clans:“Although every cat is unique, they have common affinities and traits that are determined by their clans, both by heritage and by clan culture. It would be difficult for an independent Sky Cat to feel at home among collective-minded Earth Cats, or for a dreamy and psychic Sea Cat to understand the restless urge for adventure that motivates a Fire Cat. Your own cats also belong to one of the clans, though they may not choose to reveal it to you. By observation and deepening your knowledge of clan characteristics, you may come to know them better—and know yourself better as well.”As with all her Tarot deck companion books, Weatherstone’s prose proves spiritually insightful and psychologically relevant, not to mention an enormously enjoyable read. For every card, she shares a general overview as well as sage “cat’s advice” for both upright and reversed images.Mueller’s watercolor renderings are adorable, perfectly capturing cat antics both expected and impenetrable. What I love most about her art for the Mystical Cats Tarot, though, is her conscious act of adding herbal infusions to watercolors as part of her artistic process. Catnip made it into the paint for every image, while various card-specific herbs were included based on significance and symbolism. For example, the artist incorporated ginkgo leaf and olive into the Stars card (ginkgo is noted for its memory-enhancing qualities).Thirteen artist sketches with collaborative notes between Weatherstone and Mueller serves as a nice touch to the 201-page companion book, giving us a behind-the-scenes peek into the often demanding work of deck creation. (Weatherstone’s notes to Mueller about raising up a cat’s head with the flehmen response so it doesn’t look like a Mystical Cat hairball is too funny!)Cards measure approximately 4  x 2 ¾ inches with a flexible, satin finish card stock that shuffles like a dream, while the attractive mirror-image cat’s paw motif on back is ideal for reading reversals.There are four spreads included in the companion book, and I’ve tried the 3-card Shield of Sekhmet layout with great success. I look forward tot trying the Nine Lives Spread sometime this year (on a momentous occasion).I’ve used the Mystical Cats Tarot several times within the last few months, and find it extraordinarily accurate—and a delight to use. Wether this is because of Weatherstone and Mueller’s talent or from owning (and loving) cats I can’t be sure. But if you DO adore cats, this is THE Tarot to own, in my opinion.Here’s a rundown of the (mostly) re-titled Major Arcana cards:The Cat (Fool)Cat Magic (Magician)The Priestess (High Priestess)The EmpressThe EmperorThe Priest (Hierophant)The LoversThe ChariotStrengthThe HermitThe Wheel (Wheel of Fortune)Consequences (Justice)The Floating Cat (Hanged Man)DeathGrace (Temperance)Demon Cat (Devil)The TowerStars (The Stars)MoonSunGood Kitty (Judgment)The WorldTo see 18 images from this deck, visit the Reviews—Decks section at JanetBoyer.com.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGC5V72V5CGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738733881#wasThisHelpful","RIGC5V72V5CGC","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The card designation error on the Dog card (#18, which should be the 10 of Hearts, not the 10 of Spades).

"“Victorian science would have left the world hard and clean and bare, like a landscape in the moon; but this science is in truth but a little light in the darkness, and outside that limited circle of definite knowledge we see the loom and shadow of gigantic and fantastic possibilities around us…” – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in The Coming of the FairiesWith its borderless imagery, unique title font and extraordinary watercolor art by Gary A. Lippincott, there’s a lot to love about the Victorian Fairy Tarot (companion book by Lunaea Weatherstone).Although they feature pointy ears and wings, the fairies in this deck display all-too human situations, tools, garb and backdrops, making this an accessible set of cards for all users.Vic Fairy BonusSave for the Six of Winter depicting a fleeing family gliding downriver on a swan and the Nine of Winter showing a worried fairy sitting up in bed, the Victorian Fairy Tarot is (blessedly) without Rider-Waite-Smith iconography. Yet, the cards skillfully depict what the cards usually mean—with some additional thought-provoking touches (many highlighted by Weatherstone’s engaging commentary).For example, stocked with fragrant perfumes, glittering jewels, fine fabrics, enticing elixirs and luscious fruits, The Goblin Market (The Devil) portrays the trap of materialism. Yet Weatherstone elaborates that not only are the Goblin’s wares mere temptations, but also illusive, damaging and addictive. Once bought, used or consumed, the gems turn into rough pebbles, the garments burn the skin and the fruits create more hunger. “You should have looked before you bought!” croons the Goblin.Speaking of The Goblin Market serving as The Devil card, here are the other re-named cards in the Victorian Fairy Tarot:• The Conjurer (The Magician)• The Seeress (The High Priestess)• The Vicar (The Hierophant)• The Fairy Bride (The Lovers)• Fortitude (Strength)• The Wheel of Time (The Wheel of Fortune)• The Magistrate (Justice)• The Burning Oak (The Tower)• The Stars (The Star)• Awakening (Judgement)• The Worlds (The World)The Minor Arcana suits are divided according to the four seasons:Wands – Spring CourtCups – Summer CourtPentacles – Autumn CourtSwords – Winter CourtI was pleased to see this particular demarcation since these are the personal seasonal associations I ascribe to the four suits. Even though the suits are assigned to a season, it doesn’t mean that the cards are set outdoors with obvious accoutrements (i.e. snow for winter, flower-filled fields for summer, etc.)In fact, one of the most brilliant cards in the Victorian Fairy Tarot is the Three of Winter (aka the 3 of Swords). At a fairy theater, a couple performs a dramatic scene on the distant stage. In the foreground, three women (of course) whisper behind unfurled fans, not even looking at the production.We could deduce “gossip” as an obvious meaning for the card, but Weatherstone gives us much more to think about:“Some elegant fairy ladies are finding the intrigue in the audience as riveting as the scene onstage. With little to occupy them during the long winter months, gossip is a favorite pastime, and their opinions are not always kind. Small offenses are magnified, little lapses of judgment are thrown into high relief, and everyone minds everyone else’s business far better than they mind their own. There are real tragedies, to be sure, but exaggerated melodrama serves as well for petty minds and chilly hearts…Workplace intrigue is particularly insidious, as it can cause real damage to livelihood and reputation.”What a fantastic re-casting of the traditional 3 of Swords card! (Personally, I’d ascribe this type of interpretation to the 3 of Cups reversed, but it works very well as the 3 of Swords—or the 3 of Winter—especially since both Death and the 5 of Summer demonstrate grief, disappointment, sadness and loss in this deck).The Court Cards follow a Herald, Knight, Queen and King designation, reflecting the highly hierarchical preferences of English Victorian society (and influenced by royal aristocracy).The 253-page companion book serves as a lovely tour guide of the Victorian Fairy Tarot, describing each scene, providing divination guidance, offering “in a nutshell” keywords and detailing three spreads (six, if you count the seasonal differentiations of The Herald’s Welcome spread).I found the 8-card Dance of Happiness Spread especially revealing, making me wish that Weatherstone created even more spreads for the book!The Victorian’s obsession with the “secret language of flowers” is renowned, so the artist’s use of 46 different flowers and plants (decoded in the Appendix by Weatherstone) add another interpretative, and visually appealing, layer to these cards.In my estimation, the Victorian Fairy Tarot is one of the best decks to hit the market. Artist Gary A. Lippincott renders some of the most stunning watercolor art (Tarot or otherwise) I’ve ever seen (my artist husband concurs—and he’s hard to impress). With its gorgeous play of shadow and light, the sumptuous attention to detail in this deck is much more than just pretty pictures; rather, Lippincott packs a comprehensive sense of story into almost every card—giving readers and creative writers plenty of grist for the intuitive mill.To see 18 more card images from this deck, visit the REVIEWS--DECKS section at JanetBoyer.com.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HGN3B0BF38N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738731315#wasThisHelpful","R22HGN3B0BF38N","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I look forward to EVERY Archie Sheridan/Gretchen Lowell book. They're delightfully twisted but, more importantly, full of likable, well-drawn characters. I can ""see"" them all in my head, in fact--Susan (she's got a skunk stripe in this one!), Henry, Archie's ex-wife, Debbie, etc.LET ME GO continues where the last book left off: Gretchen has left Archie a dog and is on the run (yet again). But she comes back to Portland to celebrate Archie's birthday (Halloween), just as Archie heads to the secluded island of drug dealer Jack Reynolds (dad of Leo, Susan's boyfriend who happens to be undercover DEA).We discover that Archie's girlfriend Rachel is more than meets the eye (no surprise), and, as always, there's a high body count and lots of blood in this book.My only criticism is that the whole ""Gretchen-on-the-loose-and-able-to-kill-a-dozen-men-with-just-a-scalpel"" is running thin. And, the fact that Susan got in a car ALONE, without police protection, is just unthinkable (it wasn't that long ago that she saw Pearl slaughtered in her bathroom.

The anthropologist is self-absorbed, arrogant and unlikable (despite his ""assistant"" touting his awesomeness in the beginning).I tried to force myself to read this book--I acknowledge that it's a feat to write as if you're an anthropologist detailing your life--but the disturbing fact that the protagonist is a convicted child molester coupled with the dry prose left me feeling ""Who CARES?""","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9XUYY33HDXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536771#wasThisHelpful","R3F9XUYY33HDXT","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""And since, above all else, Steampunk is about adventure--wherever, whenever and whoever it features--it seemed high time that there should be a way of looking into and through the strange distorting glass of this new-old world, and to explore its vitality and wonder, and its wisdom. Just as we may turn to the tarot to aid us in navigating the shoals of uncertainty which surround us, so, in the alternative world of the Steampunk Imperium, it opens vistas that help us to see things in a new way."" - From the Steampunk Tarot companion book by John and Caitlin MatthewsFrom hulking dirigibles to clockwork devices, intricate gears to steam-powered machines, the alternate world of Steampunk blends historical accoutrements with futuristic visions. A realm that evolved alongside our own but with various divergences, Steampunk embodies Victorian dress and manners with Edwardian industrial advancement. Add some clean fuel derived from amber (Pullman's ""anbaric powder""), metaphysical experimentation, conscious automatons and thirst for adventure, and you're witnessing the essence of Steampunk.In the scholarly, playful hands of John and Caitlin Matthews, Steampunk--sometimes derided as ""goth dressed in sepia""--finds a fresh, bold presentation when melded with Tarot structure and philosophy...a combination resulting in a complex, intelligent oracular system and set of cards.In the Steampunk Tarot, all but three of the Major Arcana--known as the Gods of the Machine in this deck--are renamed, as are the four Minor Arcana suits (Leagues) and Court Cards (Ligates).The Four Leagues are Leviathans (earth), Submersibles (water), Airships (air) and Engines (fire). The Four Ligates that govern the Leagues are Messengers (Pages), Navigators (Knights), Ladies (Queens) and Captains (Kings). In the 160-page companion book, the Matthewses also provide elaborate subsystems where four Regulators (Gods of the Machine) correspond to each League, as well as eleven complementary opposites and seven initiations of the Apprentice (seven triads).I did say the Steampunk Tarot was complex, right?However, even if you decided to forgo understanding or (trying) to apply the convoluted (but fascinating) methods of the Matthewses, the cards themselves still prove a bit inscrutable, owing to detailed imagery of fantastical equipment, intricate technology and unrecognizable paraphernalia. Thus, those who glean scads of intuitive information by illustrations alone may find the illustrations by Wil Kinghan challenging to interpret.However, for those intrigued by the idea of Steampunk sensibilities and hierarchical structures superimposed upon Tarot archetypes, the Steampunk Tarot vastly rewards the patient, the curious and the bright. The companion book is a thinking person's playground and the metaphysician's delight. Rather than simple keywords for each card, the Matthewses give seekers a holistic, perceptive overview, as well as personal lifestyle, interaction and impact (both upright and reversed). A ""Steampunk Wisdom"" phrase also accompanies each card.The authors also provide a spread for each of the Gods of the Machine (Major Arcana). Most any Tarot author can slap together a spread, but to craft twelve substantive layouts (corresponding to the 22 Majors) that each provide an insightful, meaningful blueprint for a seeker is extraordinary and commendable.I've been using the Steampunk Tarot for the last week with amazing results. Not only have my readings been incredibly accurate and insightful, but also empowering. When I asked a question and drew Triumph (Trump 7, correlating with The Chariot), I was so encouraged by what the Matthewses wrote about this card that I decided to go a step further and try out their 4-card Triumphal Procession Spread.I was so blown away by the psychological depth and precision of this spread that I've placed the four cards I drew in a prominent position on my desk to remind me of the journey I'm on, what keeps me on the road, the obstacles I need to avoid and my final (project) destination.It's obvious that much care and thought when into both the imagery and companion book, so rousing kudos to the publisher (Tuttle), authors (John and Caitlin Matthews) and illustrator (Wil Kinghan) on this superb addition to Tarot literature and thought. My Steampunk Tarot stands ready, awaiting yet another intronautic journey where visions become reality and otherworldly guidance manifests for my soul's evolutionary enjoyment.(To see 18 images from this deck, visit the REVIEWS--DECKS section at JanetBoyer.com)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USQOVHC2TRXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080484352X#wasThisHelpful","R2USQOVHC2TRXF","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""To get a better understanding of how a spread works, think of a tarot reading as a novel--stuff that happened and who was involved. But without some sort of organization, it's all just a random pile of words and information."" - From the book How to Use Your Deck of 1000 Spreads by Tierney SadlerAh, the amazing Deck of 1000 Spreads. Incredibly, no one thought of this brilliant idea before (or, didn't have the courage to create or publish it until now): a labeled, color-coded deck of cards listing spread positions and what they mean.Seasoned and professional Tarot readers know how aggravating it can be do be in the midst of a face-to-face reading--especially with clients or addressing complex issues--and forget the designation of a particular position (especially with on-the-fly spreads).""Wait. Did I say that position indicated The Past...or What Needs Released?""Ack! It's happened to the best of us.Fortunately, Tierney Sadler had the experience and foresight to eliminate this pesky problem by crafting the Deck of 1000 Spreads and its 137-page companion book, published by Llewellyn. Separated into five categories (Influences/Blue, Topic/Green, Outcome/Red, Character/Orange and Timing/Purple), this 59-card deck covers just about every question addressed by the most popular spreads used by Tarot readers: The Celtic Cross, Horseshoe, Star and various 3-card layouts.For example, among the Topic/Green cards there are labels like Card of the Day, Career, Problem, Situation, Career, Friendship, Success and so on. For the Influences/Blue cards, there are labels like Positive Influences, What You Can't Change, What Is Hidden, Surprise, What to Avoid, Hopes and Fears, etc.Unfortunately, positions from the Zodiac Spread and Chakra Spread (two of my favorites) aren't provided, nor are there cards geared towards novelists (protagonist, antagonist, villain, sidekick, subplot, turning point, complication and so on). Those types of cards would have greatly enhanced the Deck of 1000 Spreads, especially since there are only six blank cards for those types of permutations. Granted, some of the cards could be ""stand ins"" for a few of those positions, but not most of them.Despite my ""wish list"" for this deck, it's still a fresh, welcome addition to the world of Tarot and a reader's toolkit.I've given the Deck of 1000 Spreads several test runs, with clear, insightful results. I often have tons of irons in the fire, so I asked the Tarot ""What needs to be my main thrust right now in terms of creativity?""I then selected Hobbies and Talents card from the Topic/Green pool, since it ""Addresses the current state of your creative energies. When not used as the spread's topic card, it can advise on creative endeavors"". From the Snowland Deck, I drew Impermanence (Death). This card shows a melting snowman, a flying bluejay about to eat a bug, a moose drinking from a lake and the spirit of the snowman among the clouds, winking.I thought of how this card is traditionally associated with Scorpio, my Sun sign. Scorpio deals with penetrating truths, deep wisdom and transformation; it's a lot like the Phoenix mythos. Yet, Impermanence also deals with something ""passing away"" in the cycle of life...or the resistance to change.Was this card saying that I needed to let one part of my creative endeavors go--the one that I've been doing the longest--to make way for a new focus?I then fished out an Influence/Blue card: Clarification. I shuffled, asking for clarification for the Impermanence card. I drew the Mental Ace (Ace of Swords). I couldn't help but chuckle because this card shows a pointed icicle being offered from a cloud to a very eager snowman on a bright, clear winter day....clarification personified! It's also a card hinting at sharp, pointed, focused communications--an approach that happens to be my trademark. I took this to mean, ""keep being you"".So then I selected an Outcome/Red card, Advice. What was the Tarot's advice, then, in terms of my creative output? I drew Quester Energy, the equivalent of the Knight of Wands. In the Snowland Deck, this card--featuring famed Australian polar explorer Sir George Herbert Wilkins--portrays the consummate Renaissance Soul as his various exploits and talents. He was ""all over the map""...just like me!So I weaved it all together as a message to keep pushing for the hard truths in life, expose bull*&^% when I see it, and celebrate being a polymath (rather than sometimes thinking it's a liability). And, that having several creative projects going at one time is what I'm good at and what will fulfill me.The companion book How to Use Your Deck of 1000 Spreads provides a wealth of ideas on how to vary spreads, switch out cards and create your own. And, as the author points out, ""1000 Spreads"" is a misnomer: with all the cards in this deck--and the option for choosing to arrange or select them consciously or randomly--there are literally tens of thousands of possibilities.I'm especially excited to try out the chart method, where cards from this deck are arranged outside a grid as placeholders, and then Tarot cards are placed in horizontal and vertical rows. What an innovative way to see a situation from various angles or explore how an issue may impact several people all at once!My favorite part of the companion book, though, was how the author explained three Celtic Cross variation usings the same cards (but different position titles). Just extraordinary. I'd love to read an entire book with the author riffing on a dozen or more spreads using the same cards in different positions!Although intermediate and advanced Tarot readers will likely be the most comfortable using the Deck of 1000 Spreads, there's no reason beginners couldn't cut their teeth on card layouts using this box set. In fact, it may very well save them months (or years) of grief that many experienced readers endured muddling on their own without such a handy, accessible tool.Highly recommended!(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the REVIEWS--DECKS section at JanetBoyer.com)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NK5KYRE5IT4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738733393#wasThisHelpful","R2NK5KYRE5IT4T","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Kuan Yin is the Mother of Compassion. She guides us into our enlightenment, which is being able to live in harmony and unity with the Love that is, and surrendering into that Love. Enlightenment is not meant to be a distant spiritual goal, but something that we can choose to live at any time, by choosing love, kindness, compassion and wisdom over fear, judgement, anger or separation from the Source, the Divine Feminine, that seeks to nourish us so that we blossom into the fullness of our being."" - Alana FairchildFor those weary of the fear-based zeitgeist, the Asian goddess Kuan Yin serves as a balm to deflated souls. This Mother of Compassion finds expression via delicate, ethereal images painted by Chinese artist Zeng Hao in the 44-card Kuan Yin Oracle, published by Blue Angel Gallery (Australia). With profound, heart-based insights by Alan Fairchild, this deck offers wisdom, healing advice and prayers to help seekers operate from their Higher Self.The 143-page companion booklet provides two excellent spreads (the 3-card Kuan Yin's Mirror and the 4-card Lotus Blossom), as well as 2-3 pages dedicated to each card, explaining the energy of the card, the issues or circumstances likely at play when the card comes up, a healing meditation and a prayer.As with most of the Blue Angel Gallery decks, the cards are quite large and glossy, measuring approximately 5  x 3 ¾ inches. Each card is titled and numbered, making it easy to find the corresponding entry in the companion booklet.In the companion book, Alana Fairchild points out that ""You might have a specific question but know that the Divine Mother brings to you what you need..."" When using the Kuan Yin Oracle, I've found this to be very true.For example, the other night, I was troubled by the behavior of a Tarot blogger who writes for the same group blog that I do. I've never had any interaction with this person before, and she's new to the blog, but when I came across a post of hers, I took the time to comment--complimenting the post and sharing my own insights on the topic.To my surprise, she deleted my comment and blocked me from further posting.I can only assume she's a part of the petty Tarot clique that's made it their mission to blackball and ignore me no matter where I am.In the back of my mind, though, I was also discouraged about the direction of my writing--not sure if I was on the best path for my highest good.I decided to test out the Kuan Yin Oracle, asking about the snub by the Tarot blogger. Interestingly, I drew Card 24, Reveal the Peacock Beauty. Some of the wisdom of this card includes:""As the power of the throat chakra grows, our urge to express ourselves in an uniquely creative way becomes strong...This oracle is also an indicator that whatever project, plan or purpose you have been contemplating is in alignment with the higher creativity of your Soul. Don't worry if the details aren't unfolding as you thought they would. It is always wise to be clear with your intention and surrender the details to the Universe so that they can unfold according to a vision greater than our own...Don't give up, but do let go. Allow the beauty within to find its expression now, beloved. It is time for your inner beauty to shine.""I was blown away at how the advice seemed to address both issues that were on my mind (one in the forefront, the other in the back). The purpose of any kind of shunning (or shaming) is to shut down the Throat Chakra of the target--to crush the will to the point of ""shutting her up"". It's an insidious, passive-aggressive, fear-based approach to dealing with a disliked person, to be sure.Bolstered and encouraged by the additional advice of the Peacock Beauty card, I sat in awe at how its message resonated on multiple levels. It reminded me to keep on shining, to pursue beauty, to allow the powerful creative energy generated in the Sacral Chakra to rise up and manifest in the Throat Chakra via written communication (in my case, blogging and writing a novel)--free from the bad (or good) opinions of others. I am in Higher Service to something Greater, and it's my sacred duty to allow the beauty within to find expression.So, just in case you wonder if the Kuan Yin Oracle may be too ""gentle"" or ""feminine"" for you, allow me to point out that other expressions in this deck include Mother Fierce, Orchid Priestess of Destiny, Daughter of the Phoenix, Sound of the Fierce Flute, The Book of Changes and Weave the Future Golden. In other words, some heavy-hitting spiritual energy to help you bust through blockages, stay resolute, honor your own authority, act courageously and choose compassion--not exactly pursuits for the faint of heart!Even if you're not a fan of Asian art or familiar with Eastern spirituality, don't let that keep you from acquiring the Kuan Yin Oracle...especially if you feel inexplicably drawn to it. I didn't expect much when using it, only because I've associated Kuan Yin with ""just"" compassion and nurturing energy. By the skillful words of shaman priestess and spiritual alchemist Alana Fairchild, however, I've come to realize that the Mother Goddess is so much more than I assumed--and powerful beyond imagination.

"I own an original Kindle Fire and was so pleased with it, I decided to buy a new Kindle Fire 7"", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers when it was on sale for Cyber Monday.To say my husband I and are disappointed is the understatement of the year.Last night, our new Kindle Fire FROZE UP. I have never, ever had my old Kindle Fire freeze up on me. I don't even have any of our apps pulled from the Cloud yet! (So it's not like I've used up any memory in less than 24 hours of owning it...) I had to re-start the thing! Geez, and I thought the ""blue screen of death"" was unique to Microsoft!My husband says the screen is SUPER touchy, and he had trouble comfortably browsing Amazon's new music (as an example). He'd barely swipe something trying to scroll down, and it would activate what he last touched. OVERLY sensitive.Speaking of music, my husband LOVED finding new music on our old Kindle Fire. He said there used to be a heading like Photos, Album Art, Details and Related. He'd tap Related to get a whole bunch of thumbnails of related music to find new artists. He says the new Amazon music section for Kindle does NOT have this.For me, I had a hard time setting up my email. In fact, although the cursor is blinking on my POP 3 line, I canNOT ""tap in"" to change the correct incoming address! Finally, one of those square cursors came on the beginning, but I could NOT move it to delete was on there by default so I could type in a new, correct POP 3 incoming address!Even the browser actually seems SLOWER than the old Kindle Fire. (!)The pluses of the new Kindle Fire is the crisp images (should you use/keep photos on your Kindle Fire) and the keyboard interface (it works much better IMO...I'm much less likely to ""accidentally"" tap a neighboring keyboard). The ads aren't bad--they just work as a screen saver you can ""swipe"" away when going ""Home"" (but I don't think parents would want some of them, to be honest). And, the kid's FreePlay is good because, on the old Kindle, if you were giving it to your child (as I was) you can technically REMOVE content from the device...but not the Cloud. And, kids could just access the Cloud by one touch, see all the book covers, re-download it if they weren't supervised, etc.I'm returning our new Kindle Fire. I guess I'll have to be on the lookout for an OLD one to be my NEW one now that I took an hour or so yesterday removing all MY content from my OLD Kindle Fire which is now our son's. *sigh*","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUCJI68UIKH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083Q04IQ#wasThisHelpful","RAUCJI68UIKH8","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""As he walked up the aisle of his church, broken glass crunched beneath his boot. He spotted a brick on a nearby pew. ""Not again"", he sighed. ""Lillie, be careful.""""Why would anyone break our windows?"" his daughter asked. ""Well, some people don't like our church because we don't believe in slavery"", Mr. Pierpont said. ""Someone is probably angry because our congregation has four members who once were slaves. Four members who are much more likely to go to heaven than the person who threw that brick, I might add."" - From the book Jingle Bells: How the Holiday Classic Came to BeAttempting to recreate the sound of sleigh bells from his native Boston, John Lord Pierpont climbed the stars to the church pipe organ and began to plink out some notes. He begins to sing ""jingle bells, jingle bells..."" and, recalling that his parishioner Mrs. FitzHugh said  ""oh what fun"", realizes he may have the beginnings of a song.During the sweltering Georgia heat at Thanksgiving time, undaunted by racist vandalism, Mr. Pierpont and the children's choir introduce a new song to welcome the holidays, as was their yearly custom.Two girls stroll up the aisle shaking strands of bells, and Mr. Pierpont calls down from the organ loft for the congregation to join him in singing the new song One Horse Open Sleigh. When the song is over, the rest of the children throw white feathers in the air as the congregation bursts out in applause.Although the story is fictional, author John Harris did extensive research in Savannah, Georgia, including interviewing the folks at the Unitarian Church on Oglethorpe Square where John L. Pierpont served as music director. AT the end of the book is a two-page spread relaying some facts about Pierpont, as well as actual photos.Sumptuously illustrated by Adam Gustavson (Snow Day!), Jingle Bells: How the Holiday Classic Came to Be is a beautifully told tale that not only brings a slice of Christmas history to life, but also lifts the spirits of readers young and old.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTBYR7GBXIOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561455903#wasThisHelpful","R3HTBYR7GBXIOL","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because there's no thorough description of this deck, The Original Dog Tarot, I assumed that I would be getting a bone-a-fido Tarot--78 cards (or close to it).Imagine my utter surprise and disappointment to find out that The Original Dog Tarot contains ONLY 30 cards--far less than the even average non-Tarot oracle decks (which usually contain at LEAST 44 cards).Not only that, there's not even a full Major Arcana (22 cards)--and the numerical order doesn't even follow a traditional Tarot deck. The Major cards are:I The FoolII The Magician (Nostradogus)III The KibbleIV The HydrantV The AuricleVII The MoonVIII The SunIX The CatX The DogcatcherXI The WandererXII The ChariotXIII The CouchXIV The HangdogXV The ShelterXVI The RuntXVII The Wheel of FortuneXVIII JusticeAnd The Minor ""Barkana"" of The Original Dog Tarot? Only three cards to each of the four suits (bowls, bones, biscuits and leashes)--Ace, Three and Seven. These cards aren't ""animated"", only showing 1, 3 or 7 items of the suit. Supposedly, the Aces refer to the ""human"", the Seven to the ""canine"" and the Threes a balance between them. Each suit, in its brief entirety, is described in the equivalent of one booklet page. Based on the brief suit descriptions, those who are familiar with Tarot will recognize the connection between bowls/cups, biscuits/wands, leashes/swords and bones/coins...but actual references to traditional Tarot correlations are non-existent.The author tries to be clever, but bears no resemblance to the knowledgeable, witty writers of the companion books to campy decks like the Housewives Tarot (who actually have a respect and familiarity with the history and traditional design of the Tarot).For example, here's an example of a One-Card Draw Reading from the companion booklet:""Jannie bought her enchanting Corgi mix, Bean, a dazzling Halloween costume but wasn't sure she should make her wear it. Janine knew Bean would look fabulous in her flowered headdress and matching tutu, and would enjoy the resulting attention. But friends said it was ridiculous to dress a dog like a doll. Conflicted and confused, Janine asked the Dog Tarot, `How would Bean be impacted by dressing her for Halloween?' She drew a single card: The Runt (XVI), the card of transformation. It suggested that every dog had a special gift waiting to be unleashed. For Jannie, the message was a sign to dress Bean and go trick-or-treating with the neighborhood children. In costume, Bean was beguiling, floating down the street, pleased and proud. People gathered in admiration, and soon she'd collected more treats than the children. At home, an exhausted and radiant Bean fell into a deep, happy sleep, sighing, dreaming of next year's Halloween. A star had been born. The truth was in the cards.""Okaaaay...I firmly believe that tools like Tarot can be used to not only connect with our pets, but also to help ""diagnose"" behavioral problems or ways to enrich the lives of our furry companions. I believe that animals are sentient, and that pets are an incredible blessing to humans.Which is one reason why this Dog Tarot rubs me the wrong way.I almost get the feeling that the creator, Heidi Schulman, is mocking those who use Tarot cards for insight into animals...or any other situation. It's clear that she loves dogs, make no mistake, but it appears she has little knowledge of traditional Tarot constructs. Granted, some of her Major ""Barkana"" interpretations, while shallow, do resemble their traditional Tarot counterparts...even if the numbering system deviates wildly from usual decks.And lest you think I take Tarot ""too seriously"", just re-read what I've written. A Zombie Tarot? Heck yeah! Housewives? Love it! A Halloween Tarot with Frankenstein, a mad scientist and fire imps? One of my favorites!But what each of those have in common is an intelligent reflection of familiar Tarot constructs, while still taking traditional ideas ""out of the box"". Not to mention that those decks also contain 78 cards.Which brings me to the idea: What IS Tarot? MUST it be 78 cards? Personally, I don't think so. I consider Lucy Cavendish's Oracle Tarot a Tarot deck, even though she removes the 16 Court Cards. John Holland's Psychic Tarot also is absent the 16 Court Cards, as well as the Minor Arcana 10s, and he adds 7 Chakra Cards to the mix.But I consider them both Tarot because they retain the 22 Major Arcana cards, as well as the majority of the Minor Arcana--with both containing over 60 cards.But a 33-card deck with a Major ""Barkana"" containing only 18 cards (most deviating a good deal from traditional numbering)--and a Minor ""Barkana"" of 12 cards?No way.This deck should be called the Dog Oracle, pure and simple. When you call a deck a ""Tarot"", it comes with certain conventions and expectations.In short, I'm glad I only paid 10 bucks for this deck. I'll be giving it away first chance I get. Heck, maybe my 14 year old will want it as a novelty.And, truly? I feel that's the only thing this deck is good for in terms of Tarot collectors/readers: a novelty for dog lovers. The art is cute, especially for the Major ""Barkana"", as is the card backing design. But for those who like oracle decks and canines, this ""original"" Dog Tarot may very well be just what the veterinarian ordered.-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarot(To see 12 images from this deck, visit the REVIEWS--DECKS section on my site)","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O97VRXAKH8JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307984931#wasThisHelpful","R1O97VRXAKH8JK","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Everyone thinks that dogs have it easy. But I work from morning till night. As soon as I get up...I make sure that no one oversleeps. Ruff! Ruff!"" - from the bookIn one of the most delightful children's books I've ever read, author Caroline Sherman offers us a dog's eye view of life.What humans may categorize as accidents, messes and annoyances have, at core, noble motivations--from a dog's point of view.""I was dishes. Slurp! Slurp!"" (A dog sneaking licks on a finished dinner plate).""Then I go outside to tidy up the yard. Splish! Splash!"" (The dog wrestles a spouting water house in its mouth).From page one of A Dog's Life, I was smiling. By page three, I was chuckling. Who knew what a dog REALLY thinks going about its daily ""chores""?And that howling at night? Why, singing lullabies until everyone is asleep, of course!Brought to playful, animated life by illustrator Donald Wu, A Dog's Life offers a comical perspective on canine antics. The dynamic close-ups will likely engage children, while the fresh perspective of what may be classified as drawbacks to dog ownership will amuse adults.My husband saw this on the table, read it and asked me ""Did you read A Dog's Life yet? It's funny!""And honestly? I can't see how anyone who reads this 22-page hardcover book would think any differently.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FIYJ626KTGZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761462007#wasThisHelpful","R1FIYJ626KTGZO","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""El Dia de los Muertos is not a time to feel sad or afraid of death. It is a time for familias (families) to come together, share memories of past loved ones, and celebrate the joy of being alive!"" - From the book""Knock-knock!Shhh!Huh?Rattle-rattleQue?Creak-crackUp we go!Big fiesta!Yay!""With colorful hats, sweeping dresses, bow ties and festive garb, author and illustrator Richard Keep commemorates the Mexican celebration known as the El Dia de los Muertos in the book Clatter Bash!: A Day of the Dead Celebration.Happy skeletons climb out of their entombment to frolic about the graveyard, driving in cars, splashing in fountains, watering marigolds, singing songs, telling stories and feasting at picnics.Replete with vibrant images in greens, purples, oranges and yellows, the first 26 pages of Clatter Bash! depicts a simple, rhyming, alliterative poem showing the fun that the dead have when the Day of the Dead begins (usually November 1 or 2).A mix of English and Spanish phrases underscores the clanking and jittering antics of the smiling skeletons that have risen for this special fiesta.In two pages at the end of the softcover story, the author explains the late-October celebrations that occur in the villages of Mexico and many places in the United States, as well as the meanings of several Spanish words and phrases.For example, children dress up as angelitos (angels), diablos (devils) and calacas (skeletons) to parade around the village with their parents, yelling Hola! amidst music and merry-making.From ofrendas (home altars) to traditional foods, graveyard picnics to common greetings, Richard Keep describes the mood, purpose and accoutrements surrounding this special holiday.As the author/illustrator says, ""El Dia de los Muertos is not a time to feel sad or afraid of death. It is a time for familias (families) to come together, share memories of past loved ones, and celebrate the joy of being alive!""Clatter Bash! not only offers a wonderful opportunity for cultural education, but also a reason to explore the topic of death. In fact, its upbeat tone and pictures would likely bring comfort to those mourning the loss of a loved one. I lost my Dad in March of this year and haven't really properly grieved yet, but this book gave me a smile and a new way of seeing his passing. Perhaps I may even make my own little Day of the Dead celebration this year.On a poignant note, the author/illustrator dedicates Clatter Bash! to Joe Lucas, who inspired this book on his deathbed.Highly recommended!(Cut-paper montage illustrations for this book were created with various papers, watercolor and acrylic paints, pens and markers).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KE1KRDLSVKW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561454613#wasThisHelpful","R2KE1KRDLSVKW8","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

More importantly, will he have the math skills to ""pay up"" what's owed the monster?With brilliant, clever rhyming verse, award-winning author Danny Schnitzlein shows what happens when kids become lazy thinkers and attempt to take short cuts with their homework. Reminiscent of TV cartoons from the 30s, exaggerated and lively art by Bill Mayer adds up to a hilarious, but instructive, tale on why math is important.A fantastic tale for numerically-adverse kids, The Monster Who Did My Math shows the all-too-real cost of not knowing how to do simple math--and how perseverance may not only result in mastery, but also actual enjoyment.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPRUYI8XEW6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561454206#wasThisHelpful","R3KPRUYI8XEW6C","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Baby Lit Books are ""a fashionable way to introduce your child to the world of classic literature"".Delightfully illustrated by Alison Oliver and conceived by Jennifer Adams, Little Miss Bronte: Jane Eyre features characters and objects from the beloved classic in the form of a counting primer.We're presented with 1 Governess, 2 Trunks, 3 Candles, 4 Towers (Thornfield Hall!), 5 Trees, 6 Chalkboards, 7 Insects, 8 Drawings (Adele! Mr. Rochester!), 9 Pears and 10 Books.Admittedly, I haven't read Jane Eyre since Junior High, but it doesn't take a Janeite to realize that calling this book BabyLit is more than a stretch (and an insult to literary types, really).If you'd like to introduce literature to toddlers in the most basic of forms (a few characters, general setting and a classic book title), then you very well may enjoy this book. I can see how it might be a big hit at an upscale baby shower (or among intellectual wannabes).But if you're looking for a basic re-telling of Jane Eyre to pass on to little ones, I think you will be greatly disappointed.-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR26R5LMJBJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423624742#wasThisHelpful","R2FR26R5LMJBJ9","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baby Lit Books are ""a fashionable way to introduce your child to the world of classic literature"".My first introduction to the Baby Lit Books was Alice in Wonderland, a color primer by Jennifer Adams with illustrations by Alison Oliver.A marvelous idea with charming illustrations, Alice in Wonderland is a flexible board book featuring a white rabbit, black shoes, a purple bottle, an orange cat, a blue caterpillar, a brown hat, pink flamingos, red hearts, a green frog and a yellow teapot.Except...the blue caterpillar isn't blue. He's teal...which looks greenish.This is obviously a big problem, because, after all, Alice in Wonderland is a color primer.I have another Baby Lit Book, Jane Eyre, and it's cover is blue. True blue. And believe me, when compared to the green caterpillar and green font that says ""blue""...well, there's a huge difference.I would have LOVED to have highly recommended this book; the bottles and the Queen of Hearts actually put a smile on my face.But as a color primer, I'm afraid I have to advise passing on Alice in Wonderland...unless you'd like to explain to your confused toddler why ""blue"" isn't really ""blue"".

"My CaseCrown case for Kindle Fire JUST arrived via FedEx...and it's wonderful!I had a hard time making up my mind as to what color I wanted but ultimately chose the dark navy blue; I figured it would be less distracting than the chartreuse one I was eyeing. ;o)The case arrives in a stiff plastic packaging that easy to open. Then, you just unfasten the velcro tab (that holds the Fire in place), remove the padding inside, slide in your Fire and re-fasten the velcro tab under your device to hold it in.Tada! That's it!Watch the video here on Amazon; the CaseCrown cover works just like the video shows. The material feels like leather with thick, tight stitches. It even smells good...sorta liek a new car smell! The inside is a soft, attractive suede-like material that's a few shades lighter than the outside ""leather"".I particularly like the magnetic cover that safely encloses the Fire; some covers are pretty, but don't have this important feature (I suppose to mimic the look and feel of an actual book..?).The only reason I'm giving this holder 4 stars instead of 5 is that the built in ""stand"" only holds the Fire in the landscape position...not portrait. This matters a wee bit to me because I have severe tendonitis that causes numb and/or painful hands, and I prefer reading my eBooks in the portrait orientation.It's a great holder that will leave your Kindle protected and add very little weight to the device.

"In arguably the performance of her life, Florence Henderson (Brady Bunch) stars as an eccentric, rough-around-the-edges farmwoman who nurses bunnies back to health.A troubled foster child named Julia has been tossed from home to home, largely because she won't speak and obsessively watches an old videotape of The Velveteen Rabbit. Her foster families don't know what to do with her--and Julia's Mom is a drug addict incapable of caring for her.Enter a loving but fallen-on-hard-times family that includes an out-of-work engineer for a father, a stay-at-home furniture-painting mom and an adolescent boy who have decided to take on a foster child (doing double duty for additional income and filling a void in the mom's heart).The caseworkers place Julia with the family, but the transition isn't smooth--especially because of Julia's lack of communication and anti-social behavior.During the holidays, cousins come over and an uncle gets the boy a BB gun. They run out in the woods and start shooting at birds--and end up injuring a bunny. Julia takes to the bunny and the family rush the animal to the vet.Barring an expensive operation, the bunny has little chance. However, the vet knows a woman who's a ""Bunny Lady""...a rabbit whisperer, if you will. The family goes to the Bunny Lady's farm and get a chilly reception, but she agrees to keep it and try to mend it.Unbeknownst to her family, Julia gets off at a different bus stop (which worries them): it's at the Bunny Lady's farm. The Bunny Lady allows Julia to visit every day, and she teaches Julia how to care for the rabbits.When the bratty boys take the healed bunny and decide to put it in one of their ""sleighs"" to push down a steep snow hill they made, Julia screams--and bites one of the boys...and then runs away deep into the forest on a bitterly cold evening.The rest of the movie shows how a family's love (and a rabbit's!) breaks through to a sad, mistrustful, lonely little girl--and how a grown man learns humility for the sake of his family and how a bitter widow's heart softens towards humanity.The Christmas Bunny isn't a saccharine holiday tale (despite receiving Five out of Five Doves from the Dove Foundation), and does have a few unsettling moments. Still, it's a redemptive, well-acted movie likely to elicit more than a few tears, as well as feelings of thankfulness for family and community.-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2CKG73CNBHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WJT5FG#wasThisHelpful","R2J2CKG73CNBHQ","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Single Mom and workaholic Jennifer Cullen doesn't have time for Christmas. In fact, hers is the only house not decorated with white lights per the unspoken community block agreement (which her neighbor is more than happy to remind her).Even Jennifer's son, Brian, isn't sure if he believes in Santa (but he obviously wants to).Jennifer is engaged to an uptight, somber jeweler who throws money at everything and everyone, and she's clearly not very happy (even though he's a ""solid"" match).Enter Uncle Ralph, a retired policeman played by Henry Winkler (The Fonz!), who flies in for Christmas to stay with Jennifer and Brian. Winker is endearing (naturally) and happens to bring along a stranded (and handsome) fellow passenger.The rest of The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is rather predictable, but it's one of the more better-acted and better-written holiday romances. I admit to shedding a few tears at the ""down-to-the-wire"", triumphantly joyous ending. It's a feel good movie, for sure, and my whole family loved it (even my 13-year old).However, there's a two inexplicable sour notes in this movie: when Jennifer's syrupy neighbor encourages her to get her lights up for the umpteenth time, Jennifer says under her breath that she's a ""light Nazi"". I bristle at anyone trivializing the Holocaust, especially in such an inane setting.But later in the movie, Henry Winkler's character says to Jennifer's fiancé's parents (who are apparently Jewish): ""Oh, I knew a few Jews. They were all thieves"". Considering Winker IS Jewish, I can't believe he agreed to speak those anti-Semitic lines!If you're not bothered by these two examples, then you'll probably love The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.

"Having just caught the talented Elle Fanning in the movie Super 8, and knowing how good of an actor John Turturro can be (Johnny Depp movie, Monk's brother), I thought I'd buy The Nutcracker: The Untold Story from Amazon without first seeing it.Boy, what a big mistake!This DVD starts out well, with lovely atmosphere, unique musical numbers (written by Oscar-winner Tim Rice), great special effects and solid acting (despite Nathan Lane's perpetually quizzical visage as Albert Einstein and a wooden Frances de le Tour).My whole family and I were transfixed, especially as the wooden nutcracker (in awesome CGI) and Mary ride an enchanted elevator sleigh up through a humongous towering Christmas tree. We had no idea what would happen next, because this ""re-telling"" of The Nutcracker had been unpredictable from the beginning (e.g. Einstein replacing Uncle Drosselmeier, Mary's mother being an opera singer about to make her debut in front of important politicians, etc.).However, once they got into the realm of the Rat King, things start getting dicey--violent and creepy, even.The Rat King (Turturro) and his minions all have rat faces, resembling Hitler's SS in uniform and demeanor (I can handle that--it makes sense). However, things soon turn violent (beyond capturing citizens of the magical kingdom).For example, a large shark swims in a gigantic aquarium. He doesn't appear menacing beyond being a shark. The Rat King, as he's threatening the captured citizens with a bizarre musical routine, deliberately drops electrical lights in the aquarium. The poor shark thrashes about, as he's being electrocuted--not for a few seconds, but MANY seconds. It was distressful and disturbing to watch.My family and I were in shock. Soon after, the Rat Queen (the Rat King's mother) summons Turturro's character. She is unkempt, drunken and barely dressed--wearing fishnet stockings (!). In a creepy Oedipal moment, she urges her son to come closer...and as he bends down for her to tell him a secret, she BITES him (hard and long).That was it for us!If you're wanting a magical family Christmas movie, this is NOT the one to get!

"Sherlock quote: ""When you've eliminated what couldn't occur, what  you're left with, no matter how...With its tight writing, ingenious plot and compelling main characters, I felt that Think of a Number, John Verdon's first book featuring retired detective David Gurney, was simply one of THE best mysteries I've ever read (and believe me, I've read hundreds).When I found out about Shut Your Eyes Tight, Verdon's second book featuring Dave Gurney, I could not WAIT to read it.Like his first book, this is a ""thinking person's"" mystery. Author Verdon's deft characterizations border on literary (yeah, that good); in fact, the dynamics between Gurney and his wife, Madeleine, is arguably just as absorbing as the central mystery.But here's the very big problem with Shut Your Eyes Tight: I figured out what the deal was within the first few chapters! This is highly unusual for any mystery, let alone with one written by a skillful writer like Verdon.I kept telling myself ""Don't tell me he's created such a great red herring that I'm completely falling for it!"" I then grew concerned that what I was actually seeing was a major hole in the middle of the plot.You see, David Gurney is a brilliant observer and detective. In fact, his colleagues won't leave him alone BECAUSE he's so good...and they try to drag him out of retirement (much to the chagrin of Madeleine).A sharp detective asks great questions. As a reader, I became unsettled when Dave wasn't asking THE most obvious question of all (which I won't say here because it's a spoiler). In fact, NO ONE was floating about the supposition of ""Wait: Is it possible that since ______, then it may be ______?""This is the point when my stomach sank, I grew irritable, and suspected that MY theory was the right one...and that author Verdon screwed up big time with his ""misdirection"". When I got to the end and found I was correct, I was bordering on severely ticked off (this book is over 500 pages long...not a short investment in time!).I was so exasperated! And yet, I couldn't hate the book because it was SO well written and absorbing!But what kind of mystery is it when the main detective, touted for his deductive powers, doesn't ask the most obvious question of all (especially given certain ""facts"" that are presented multiple times, from multiple sources)?Argggh! See my dilemma?I will definitely read the next installment of the David Gurney series (provided there is a third book) simply because I love the characters Dave, Madeleine and even Jack Hardwick (Gurney's gruff, crude and obnoxious ex-partner).I just hope that Verdon's next attempt at a ""convoluted"" mystery isn't so tangled that he once again leaves a huge gap in logic...and risks insulting, and alienating, his most ardent fans.-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPCUSO9Q2V8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307717895#wasThisHelpful","R1EPCUSO9Q2V8E","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""For centuries, the art of tarot and the science of astrology have been closely linked. Now, with the help of Tarot and Astrology, you'll master the connection between astrology and tarot--not as two separate fields of study, but as a seamless, integrated whole. If you're a tarot reader, this book will help you learn astrology. If you're an astrologer, this book will help you learn tarot. And if you already use the two arts in combination, Tarot and Astrology will help you master both specialties."" - From the bookIf you've been into Tarot for any length of time, you've no doubt seen the astrological correlations bandied about in books and on blogs. For the well versed, this fluidity between two arcane disciplines generates great insights--not to mention a communication shortcut to doubled esoteric treasures.But what if you're new to Tarot? Or, what if you're familiar with the cards, but you've learned them on your own terms or from someone who doesn't use astrological correlations in card interpretations, nor in their metaphysical practice or teachings?Not only can the mere mention of Astrology in conjunction with Tarot cause fledging (and intermediate!) Tarotists to get the vapors, but it also may discourage readers from going further with the Tarot--precisely because they assume that astrological fluency among some Tarot enthusiasts means ALL must be fluent in order to be a good reader. No so!However, Astrology brings its own rich storehouse of symbolism and archetypes, which means by becoming familiar with the secret of the stars, if you feel drawn to do so, you can only expand your cache of associations and, arguably, become a more knowledgeable, skilled tarot reader.And this is where Corrine Kenner's new book Tarot and Astrology comes in. I don't know how she managed it, but she not only gives Tarot readers a solid introduction to Astrology, but also explains why in the world astrological correlations make sense through the lens of each card.So when discussion The Emperor, for example, Corrine explains this card's connection to Aries--including behavior patterns, attitude and the ram symbol. That would be adequate, but then she explains how Aries rules the head (yes, every zodiac sign is connected to body parts, if you can believe it)...and what that means for a ""head-based"" leader with other ""head"" associations (issues?).But my favorite part of Tarot and Astrology is the Minor Arcana section. Corrine ably explains the astrological decan and placements of each Minor card, and how that energy correlates to Qabalistic spheres on the Tree of Life. For example, I love how she explains the 7 of Cups in connection to Venus (which connected to the sphere Netzach and the watery realm of Briah):""At the moment, the seven Cups are still in the process of manifestation. Their shape and structure hasn't yet materialized. For the time being, they offer nothing but promise and possibility--along with tantalizing options of perfect happiness and joy. Think of them as unborn children: when women are pregnant, they dream of all the love and success they'll share. Before those infants actually emerge, squalling and demanding to be fed, those children are perfect and unblemished little people.""Wow, isn't that the truth when faced with enticing options of the 7 of Cups? And, really, only a mother could make that brilliant connection in my estimation (meaning, Corrine also brings her life experience and wisdom to this book, as well).Now, if this is all that Tarot and Astrology contained, it would be well worth paying retail. But the author doesn't stop there. No, Corrine provides charts for court card and elemental associations, as well as the Wheel of the Year and zodiac houses. She even takes us through an actual reading with the Horoscope Spread (one of my favorites).And then there's the accessible but thorough crash course (with images) explaining house opposites (e.g. Taurus and Scorpio) and how they energies play out in the corresponding Tarot cards (Hierophant wants to maintain status quo, Death wants to shake it up or take it away).But she's not done! She actually shows reader how to read a horoscope chart (think The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need...but more succinct and with Tarot flair), providing several famous examples with complete astrological breakdown (Prince William, Marilyn Monroe, Dali, etc.). Topping it off? A nine-page glossary of astrological terms!Throughout the book are grayscale images of the recently released Wizards Tarot, co-created by the author, so readers can track the symbols and stances as she discusses them.I am thoroughly impressed by Tarot and Astrology. If you've ever been interested in the crossroad, and meeting, of the stars and the cards, you'll find this book informative and engaging. If you're a Tarot reader, your knowledge will increase exponentially by studying and using this book (and its revealing spreads). If you're an astrologer, you'll gain a unique backdoor perspective on Tarot, which will no doubt enhance your practice, too.-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarot","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GU5F72OE55SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738729647#wasThisHelpful","R2GU5F72OE55SY","A3UV7L5ND3EH8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UV7L5ND3EH8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an expensive but premium quality long telephoto for A mount.  Its only real competition in terms of later model tele zooms for A mount is the Tamron 150-600 f5-6.3 (and I can speak from experience, as I own both lenses, along with several Minolta telephoto primes and TCs).This review offers some brief comparison of these lenses, all of which offer anywhere from good to great image quality, and good to excellent value (the Sony G2 perhaps being the better lens overall, but the Tamron likely being the better value).  Any A Mount body shooter (Alpha 77/77m2/65/55/57/58/33/35 as well as the older Sony DSLRs) looking for a long telephoto should look carefully at this lens, the Tamron 150-600, and the classic Minolta primes (available used in various states of preservation) before deciding which to buy.  I would also recommend consulting the full body of reviews for all these lenses on Dyxum, which is a treasure trove of information about the entire A mount lens ecology.  There are lots of good options in other words.  This review will NOT cover the entirety of the A mount lens ecology (leaving out several older Sigma 400mm telephoto primes, and all the dozens of permutations of various Sony and Minolta and 3rd party 300 2.8 primes and TCs - after all, it's an Amazon review, not a book!)Pros1) Optimized for sharpness at the long end - sharper at the long end wide open than any other competing telephoto zoom, including the new Tamron, and premium Canikon products (which are typically excellent). Also quite sharp (on both APS-C and FF) at wide and in middle FL, if stopped down slightly.  Overall, a very sharp optic, close to the class leading (for A mount) Minolta 400 4.5 prime, which is probably the benchmark for sharpness at 400mm for Alpha mount2) Compact size  - at least for storage and shooting at 70mm (but extends on full zoom to a rather long lens ~ 13” at 400mm)3) Virtually no CA or PF (purple fringing, esp. on bright edges, the principle vulnerability of the great Minolta legacy telephoto primes)4) Built like a tank, like most Sony G lenses5) Excellent focus limiter6) Has corrections for vignetting (minimal on APS-C), CA (which is minimal anyway and very well controlled), and distortion (also minimal) in firmware for many A mount bodies - something no 3rd party lens can claim7) Very quiet and fast focusing, significantly faster than G1 version and somewhat faster than the best of the screw drive legacy lenses (advantage SSM).8) Great soft case that really protects the lens in case of those potentially disastrous drops9) The 70mm wide end is really useful if you want to shoot people as well as animals, and is quite fast at that FL (f4) for a long lens, giving an extra measure of utility and reducing your kit size (I can drop the 'beercan' (Minolta's classic f4 70-210) from the lens bag if I need to save weight) given the overlapping range.  Almost 6 X zoom range (70-400 overall) is actually pretty impressive, and exceeded only by the Bigma 50-500 (which is poorer at the long end)Cons:1) Heavy (but still lighter than the competition) at 3.3 lbs, just at the end of what you can tolerate hand holding for long periods of time.2) Expensive (roughly twice the price of Tamron 150-600) and only slightly less than a used Minolta 400 4.5 in great condition (which is sharper lens and can use 1.4xTC to get additional reach to 560mm with modest loss of sharpness)3) Due to being only f5.6 at long end, no AF functionality with Sony or Minolta 1.4xTCs (can use Kenko 1.4TC OTOH, but with slowed AF)4) Hood seems a bit fragile, particularly for such a heavy lens.  Replacement cost for hood (if you can even get one!) is likely to be ridiculous (Sony baloney?)5) Slightly stiff zoom ring (probably mildly binding from rubber zoom ring)? (contrast it with the butter smooth and light zoom action on the older Minolta Beercan, an unfair comparison perhaps given that the Beercan is a much smaller optic)6) If you are looking for the smoothest bokeh, look elsewhere (true for virtually all tele zooms) -  and get a tele prime instead.7) Really should be weather-sealed at this price.That’s it - no major cons in terms of functionality, just premium cost for a premium lens.  So how does this stack up against the Minolta primes, the Tamron 150-600 and the older Sigma tele zooms, with both the Sigma and Tamron zooms being less than half the cost?  Well, like in relationship to a lot of other technology items, you truly get what you pay for.  It’s sharper at 400mm than any of the Tamron or Sigma zooms (but only slightly sharper than the new Tamron if both are at 400), and cropped images from the Sony at 400mm compare well to the Tamron at 600mm, which gets pretty soft frankly all the way out, and not nearly as sharp all the way out as the Sony is at 400. This suggests that the last 150mm or so of the Tamron doesn’t really get you that much - however at 400mm the Tamron is close in sharpness to the Sony and again, only 1/2 the price.  So once again, there are basic tradeoffs.  The Sony is lighter and more compact, slightly sharper, but lots more $.  For BIF shooting, probably would vote for the Sony G2, given likely better AF optimization and wider FL range, lighter weight, and more compact dimensions.  But you can't complain about the cost-to-function ratio of the Tamron, a real value home run IMO.For a bit more money ($2500-3000 for excellent to mint copy) the Minolta 400 4.5 might be sharper, but only a little, although it is also a full stop faster.  Although the Minolta and the Sony are roughly equally sharp wide open, if you set both at 5.6 (that’s still wide open for the Sony and a full stop down for the Minolta prime), you would find the Minolta perhaps a bit sharper even than the Sony G2, but OTOH, you will have a bit more PF/CA on the Minolta, and it’s quite a bit heavier and  . . . even more money (!).  The Minolta prime won’t focus as fast or as quietly, but it can use 1.4TC to get to 560mm. While the SSM of the Sony seems like a big advantage, the old screw drive AF on the Minolta tele prime is still competitive, and the excellent AF system on the Sony A77ii breaths new life into many older legacy Minolta screw drives. So on this comparison, it's the pluses of the Minolta against the PF issue and extra weight and cost that may help you decide which is better for you.  As a big plus, the Sony G2 is significantly lighter at 1500 g than either a Minolta 400 tele prime (quite heavy at 1900 g), or the Tamron 150-600 (1950 g) or the Sigma 50-150 (1840 g). Its 3.3 lbs is just on the limit of what you can wear on your Black Rapid or competing strap system.  So there you have it.  The Sony G2 and the Minolta primes are perhaps the best IQ choices, but all three options are in fact good to great values.  The Minolta 400 4.5 is actually a phenomenal value, given the 2x cost of competing Canikon products.  Only its screw drive and vulnerability to purple fringing are downsides, and the PF is easily removed in post processing, and as noted above, the screw drive is actually pretty fast and accurate with the A77ii.  People complain about the lens ecology of Sony vs. the Big Two, but this is an example actually of where that negative chatter doesn't really hold up to much careful scrutiny. Admittedly, A mount lacks newer telephoto primes, particularly a 400 prime and a newer f4 300, but that's really about it.  This lens is still better than the competing Canikon products (see testing at DPR).Hopefully, this gives you a quick survey of the main current options for long telephoto zooms on your Alpha body.Highly recommended overall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LAE7ATPG10HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFQHGV4#wasThisHelpful","R3LAE7ATPG10HQ","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So why would someone regard a road racing game as sleezy?  That seems a stretch at best.  WUWT?It emerges from the so-called 'freemium' design approach where premium content is given freely, but typically has to be unlocked fully with some form of payment.  The problem with this is that you get into almost any particular racing contest and discover that it is impossible to complete it without paying exorbitant fees that collectively WELL exceed the cost of any premium videogame.  I know of individuals who have spent hundreds of dollars on this game to get upgrades, buy cars, etc. They hook you in with great graphics and gameplay, and indeed from that standpoint, it's clearly a five star game, and then they soak you for everything that you're worth.  It's a bit like a drug dealer giving you the initial bag free, but then the price ratchets up until you've sold your car, your house, and virtually everything else you own.  Another marketing analogy are the so-called 'auction' websites (they really are functionally and for all intents and purposes better regarded as gambling websites) where they advertise iPads and expensive cameras for ~ $15 - in other words at too-good-to-be-true prices, but what they don't tell you is that you could easily spend twice the cost of the item bidding for it in terms of their bidding system, and, where the cost of each bid is hidden up front (a $15 bid actually might cost you $300).  It's really nothing more than a sleazy form of 'bait and switch' where you advertise one thing but deliver something very different.I would avoid this game completely - unless you can stick religiously to not paying anything (which means you won't be able to finish virtually any race or contest).  It's a shame that Electronic Arts doesn't release a version where you actually pay for the game but then don't get nickel and dimed to the tune of $100 or more over the course of playing the game.Obviously they discovered this is a way to make WAY more money.

"This is an exceptional value in an inkjet Photo printer, particularly if you can get a good used one (Several are available for ~$200 or less on Amazon.com).

"This lens is legendary, and like a lot of legends, its reputation could be considered somewhat hyped and distorted by the inevitable nostalgia.  Some photographers approaching this lens will be disappointed and have a low tolerance for its well-documented quirks and vulnerabilities, (esp. PF) while some will appreciate that they are indeed holding a beautifully crafted piece of photographic history. Affectionately termed ""the beer can"", this lens gained its reputation both for creating very sharp images, even wide open, and for its smooth bokeh and famous 'Minolta colors'.  Regarding these attributes, its reputation is largely very well deserved.Despite some significant caveats (see below), I'm giving this five stars.  The lens is hardly perfect, and with significantly more chromatic aberration and particularly purple fringing when wide open than you would ever see in a modern zoom lens, particularly a premium one - far and away its biggest vulnerability.  However, stopping down reduces this fairly significantly, and the lens is incredibly sharp from F 5.6 down to F8/11.  Its central sharpness might be as good as any modern lens, particularly if you're willing to stop down a bit to F5.6 - 6.3.  Indeed, overall sharpness (both at the wide and at the far telephoto end) compares quite favorably with premium 70-200 2.8 lenses from Canon, Sony, and Nikon, but of course, given that it is an F4 lens, it is significantly lighter (although not particularly light for a constant f4 3x zoom lens).  Those premium 2.8 lenses will be somewhat sharper at F4 than this lens, but this lens is not embarrassed at f4. Buy one, just make sure that the aperture return is snappy, and that you can send it back if proves a poor or damaged copy.A mint one is a piece of photographic history, and a delight to shoot with.  For $200 (still many mint copies available for that little money), it would be hard to find an overall better value in digital photography lenses in the short telephoto range.A great lens for any Sony A body, APS-C or FF.Pros:1) Good sharpness wide-open and exceptional sharpness, particularly centrally, if you stop down 1 to 2 stops.2) High quality zoom mechanism, and the lens exudes a premium feel.  The expression ""built like a tank"" must have been invented to describe Minolta legacy lenses.3) Pretty decent autofocus, particularly for older screw drive mechanism.  Focus limiter on newer Sony bodies helps reduce hunting and improves rapid autofocus lock.4) Nothing short of phenomenal value for the money - very good copies can be had for $100-$150, while mint copies go for $200-$250.  No modern lens approaches its performance for remotely this little money.Cons:1) Vulnerability to chromatic aberration and particularly purple fringing which can be quite noticeable, particularly when the lens is shot wide open.  Can be a PF monster, when shooting bright object wide open.  No sense in glossing over this, it is the lens' biggest liability, and if you're going to shoot with it, you should expect it.  Fortunately, this can be removed fairly effectively in post processing by any number of programs that have a profile for this lens (for example DxO optics Pro 10.2 and earlier versions of 10 have correction profiles).  Stopping down improves this significantly and by f6.3 purple fringing is minimal.2) Noisy, particularly compared to any newer USD/SSM lens. If you're planning on shooting movies with this lens, you're going to want to manual focus - unless you plan to do 'silent movies'.3) Vulnerable to flare so you have to take extra caution to make sure that the sun is not either in the frame or just outside the frame.  Significantly more flare than the best modern lenses4) Somewhat heavy relative to modern F4 zooms (the price you pay for the 'bank vault' construction).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XWEE5ZBTAJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XYIIP2#wasThisHelpful","R29XWEE5ZBTAJ8","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the classic legacy lens referred to as ""the secret handshake"" - a reference to the rumor that at the time of its release that it was given to loyal Konica Minolta users at cost as a 'secret handshake' deal to reward them for their loyalty.  Very doubtful that this rumor is true, but it is part of the legend around this lens.There are many good reasons for why this lens is truly legendary.  First of all, it was a VERY expensive lens at the time of its release in 1985, roughly $700 - ~ $2K in today's money.  The lens, in its day, was probably the sharpest wide-angle to short telephoto 5x zoom that had ever been manufactured.  Relative to premium lenses of today, it's still sharp, although perhaps not quite as sharp for example as the pricey Zeiss 24-70 2.8 full frame zoom optic - probably the best current walkaround-every-day-zoom lens for full frame Alpha mount, but it is very close to the Zeiss, especially past 28 mm, its least sharp focal length.  On the other hand, relative to a modern lens, it does have a fair amount of chromatic aberration,  and its minimum focusing distance is a ridiculous 5 feet, outside of a modestly useful macro setting (which curiously is set on the wide as opposed to the telephoto end of the lens).  And since it is built like a tank, it's not a lightweight wonder, at over 700 g. Additionally, when you have the macro switch engaged, it's all manual focus, a minor loss of flexibility for most people, as most people shooting macro will probably manual focus anyway.  So it's a quirky lens by modern standards.  But it is a very high quality piece of optical gear, and once you have manipulated it, and shot with it, you will understand the legend.It works well (at least for me) on APS-C as a portrait-oriented people-shooting lens, kinda of long for a classic walk around lens but still useful.  On APS-C, it's not really any kind of wide-angle, going from about 42 mm to about 200 mm - so it's a good lens for shooting people at various stages of assembly, particularly candid shots on social occasions where the extra reach is really important.  On FF, it's a bit more useful, going from moderate wide-angle to moderate telephoto.  As one would predict, on APS-C, there is significantly less vignetting, and corners are better wide open towards the wide-angle end, while corners are rather soft on full frame at 28 mm, even stopped down.  However, as the lens extends out, and you get more into mid range and short telephoto focal lengths, corners are pretty good, especially if you stop down a little bit, where they can become excellent, especially again on APS-C.  Central sharpness is a strength of the lens throughout its focal ranges and apertures, and on APS-C, if you're at a >6.3 aperture, the lens can be very, very sharp.  On the other hand, it's rather vulnerable to flare and ghosting, and in its original form, they did not supply a lens hood, exacerbating this vulnerability.  This can be mitigated with a 72mm hood, which I have for my copy.Pros:1) Excellent overall sharpness especially past 28 mm, and especially if stopped down to 6.3-11, with very strong central and very good corner sharpness.2) Very high quality mechanism, and the lens simply exudes a premium bank vault feel, untouchable at its current average price of around $200-$300. Built like a tank (but see cons)3) Pretty decent autofocus, with snappy performance, although perhaps not as fast as any modern SSM or USD but still reasonably responsive.4) Highly flexible five times zoom ratio, probably overall more useful on FF than APS-C, where the 1.5 crop factor wipes out any version of wide-angle, but where it becomes a great candid people-shooter lens for street shooting and candid portraits at social gatherings.5) A truly excellent-to-simply-untouchable value, as mint copies can be had for $250-$300.Cons:1) Significantly more chromatic aberration and vulnerability to flare than most modern lenses - modern coatings and other improvements in optics have really reduced these problems (but DxO Optics Pro for example has CA correction profiles for this lens, substantially mitigating this problem).  Don't have the sun in the frame!!  Or near it!2) Heavy (downside of being built like a tank).  Can be tiring to carry on heavy FF body.3) Somewhat noisy relative to modern SSM/USD designs - Don't shoot movies with this unless you're doing manual focus!  Makes audible clacking sounds..4) Ridiculous MFD minimum focusing distance just under one light year (OK, I'm kidding it's really 5 feet) - another clue that this design is 30+ years old.5) Somewhat softer corners wide-open than in the very best modern lenses.  These will sharpen up at most FL with stopping down and by f7-8 corners are often very sharp.6) Bokeh not so great at wide end (a bit harsh actually), but significantly better zoomed out, where it approaches classic 'beercan' smoothness.7) End of barrel rotates while zooming, making some filters problematic. Also, Minolta didn't supply a hood (but this can be had elsewhere).In short, there is a good reason for why this lens is legendary (along with its famous telephoto cousin the 'beercan'), and although modern lenses exceed it in a number of areas, shooting in its sweet spot (50 mm-135 mm slightly stopped down), it competes with anything, and it simply blows away any more modern zoom lens you can buy for your Sony Alpha mount that costs anywhere near $250.Get a good copy (make sure you can return it if it turns out to be a lemon), and specifically, make sure the aperture blades are not sticky, and you will not regret it. But do expect more flare and some CA relative to the best newer lenses.  It's still an absolute classic for a reason!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2ZUGHSBQKFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XSLDZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1R2ZUGHSBQKFE","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:1) Untouchable reach per $ value. Compare to Nikon, Sony and Canon L glass with this much reach and good sharpness. $1000 less on average than the comparable first-party (brand name) alternatives.2) Sharp from 150 to 400-450mm, even wide open.  Very sharp at the wide end.3) Excellent build quality, with nice hood, lens collar. Premium feel for modest $4) On APS-C, this lens gives you 900mm of reach (~ small telescope range).Cons:1) Sony version (as usual) has no stabilization but costs the same?? WUWT?2) Softens at 500-600 wide open (sharpens back up somewhat if you stop down to f8 but still not critically sharp).  Classic zoom behavior of declining sharpness as you zoom out.3) Will creep if tilted down4) A big honkin' lens to tote around (but what else do you expect for 600mm?)5) Not great bokeh (discovered after first couple of shoots), hence the 4/5 stars.If you are looking for quality LONG zoom, and want to save big $, this is a very good lens.  One of the few long telephoto options for Sony Alphas, esp. since Sigma isn't releasing the Sport 150-600 model for Sony mount, and the cheaper Contemporary 150-600 isn't out for another several months at least.  Only option beyond the pricey but excellent 70-400 G2 Sony, which offers comparable (SLIGHTLY BETTER) sharpness at 400 and better bokeh (maybe only slightly sharper but much smoother background blur) but doesn't go past 400 mm. Problems with bokeh somewhat minimized if you shoot wide open, but then lens is not as sharp, past 400-450 mm.  With better bokeh and slightly sharper long end, this is easily a five star lens.  Perhaps in Gen 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UKOAI4VJ3R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HR6IKY8#wasThisHelpful","R15UKOAI4VJ3R7","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Offers a serious alternative to the very pricey Sony 70-200 2.8 GII lens (a $3000 proposition) for just about half the price list.  Very similar in weight and performance according to DPR testing (check out their website and use their lens comparator tool).Pros:1) Just as sharp as the Sony G2, and very sharp if stopped down to F4 (sharpness peaks at F5.6), and probably sharpest at 70mm but decent performance at max telephoto 200mm focal length as well.2) Fairly compact - lens barrel does not extend - very much like the Sony (indeed one wonders if Tamron is in fact making the Sony lens, given how closely these two lenses perform, test, and appear).3) Excellent value, and can be had on this website no less for just over $1000 - essentially 1/3(!) the price of the Sony G2 lens.4) Works on both full frame and subframe alpha bodies.5) Solid professional construction and weather sealed. Built like a tank (but see Con #1)Cons:1) Weighs like a tank.  Heavy much??  At least it doesn't sound like a tank, with the creamy smooth USD motor.  Is this weight the price you pay for this level of construction? Not sure. . . perhaps the design team felt that the lens had to withstand random cruise missile attacks?  This would.  In any case, this is a bit of a bear to tote around for any length of time. Hans and Franz would be pumped to carry.  YA!!  :-)2) No onboard image stabilization in the Sony mount - have to use Sony's internal steady shot stabilization which is clearly not quite as effective as the best optical stabilization systems (like this one) available only in the Canon and Nikon mounts.3) Correction profiles for vignetting, distortion and chromatic aberration for third-party lenses not built into Sony Alpha body operating system/firmware - This forces you to use DxO Optics Pro or some other similar program that has such lens parameter information, for removing these commonplace issues.  Mitigating this, CA is rather modest with this lens in most circumstances, and vignetting on a subframe body is minimal.Conclusion:A truly great value in a mid-range fast 2.8 telephoto lens for Sony alpha mounts.  Works well with both full frame and APS-C, which means that if you plan to sell your crop frame body at some point and move up to full frame, you don't have to sell your glass.  Overall, highly recommended.

"This is an exceptionally sharp lens, and gives a very nice 100 mm on FF or 150 mm perspective on an APS-C sensor body like the Sony A 77/77II.In terms of image quality it's mostly a five star lens, particularly if you stop down just a little bit to F4, but I'm giving it four stars because of its hunting and noisy motor (see cons). Call me picky or just spoiled by the newer lenses, like Sony's terrific 16-50 2.8.Pros:1) Extremely sharp, quite sharp wide open, but once you get to F4-F8 it's tack sharp across the whole frame.2) Can get extremely close so that you have 1:1 magnification with huge details, amplified by the great sharpness, and color.3) Reasonable value, and can be picked up used for $550 or so.4) Most Sony alpha bodies have correction profiles and can be micro-adjusted terms of autofocus, although mine seems to be extremely accurate without any micro-AF adjustment.Cons:1) Very noisy older motor - why can't Sony replace the older motors in their legacy Minolta designs with newer SSM motors?2) Hunting back and forth looking for autofocus lock, particularly when you have gone from close-up macro to distance work, such that you sometimes have to use the focus limiting feature either on the lens, or on the body, if you want to keep the focus-hunting to a reasonable minimum.3) Still hunts even with focus limiting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H925ZGG9Q6Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000DZH7J4#wasThisHelpful","R3H925ZGG9Q6Z9","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've already written two long reviews about Dragon Naturally Speaking products and I swore that I would never write another long software review.  So much for promises in good faith.  To give you the short executive summary - my previous experience with various DNS versions is that they are the most Janus-faced, trick-or-treat programs in the PC world, capable of astonishing dictation accuracy and speed, but a buggy mess that oftentimes didn't play nice with several other major programs in the PC world, and were sometimes impossible to install and uninstall properly. They are, to paraphase Dickens, the best of programs and the worst of programs running on PCs.  They can save you an enormous amount of grief and cause an enormous amount of grief - I'm still not sure which polarity is truly ahead.  Nuance also has a complete monopoly on good speech recognition, and this may be part of the problem.I had a pretty bad experience with attempting to install DNS 12 from DNS 11, which trashed my DNS 11 speech files after multiple attempts to update them to the DNS 12 format (and therefore I didn't use 12).  This followed a mixed experience with DNS 11 - buggy at first but way better after the 11.5 patch, but I foolishly and navely hoped that Nuance had learned from their previous cascade of negative feedback to make DNS 13 a more user-friendly installation experience.  I must have been smoking something to think that. . .I've just come from a five hour installation nightmare, with multiple failed installs despite ""technical support"" from Nuance.  I put technical support in quotes here simply because I don't think the technical support person really knew anything that I didn't know.  First of all, the install program would not uninstall the previous edition (DNS 11.5), and I had to download their executive remover software to get it completely off the system.  Not only wouldn't the new program uninstall the old one, but using the Windows uninstall function also failed.  Why an industrial-grade souped-up proprietary uninstall program is required to get rid of the old version is itself an interesting mystery and raises a lot of questions about program operation.  How can a program be installed such that Windows can't uninstall it properly?  I have no idea, but it does seem consistent with how a bunch of things seem to happen with Nuance DNS.  This is not a unique failing, as other programs can be tough to get rid of, but a program that has sold easily 100 million copies of its last five versions??  Come on Nuance.  That's really a sign again that Nuance is doing everything BUT sweating the details.Part of the problem may be simply that the core SR (speech recognition) program has become a swollen, bloated and HUGE base of code.  Including loading user speech files, DNS 11 took longer to load than the whole operating system of Win 7 (over 3.5 GB by my calculation for both program and speech files).  With that much code, it may be impossible to get rid of all the bugs.  I've owned every addition since DNS 4 or 5, and it's become an increasingly larger program at each edition.  To their credit, Nuance appears to have made a conscientious effort to trim the size of DNS 13 relative to the code base size of 11 and 12, but they have not addressed the buggy and finicky install process at all.  I have to wonder therefore if the other operational weaknesses have gotten much attention.Getting back to the DNS 13 installation saga . . . . . It only got better - after finally successfully uninstalling the previous version of the program, and rebooting, the program still would not install - and indeed it seemed to fail in exactly the same installation point.  The tech support person indicated that the solution was to turn off the Windows firewall (!!!)  He insisted that this was part of their protocol.  I asked him how often this was really thought necessary - he couldn't say. In any case, an unknown percentage of the time, installation of a product requires turning off a fundamental safety feature on your computer system?  What??  Why is that necessary?  What is it that Nuance believes that they need to do to your system, from the standpoint of turning off your firewall?  I asked the technician this, and he could not answer, and just said that this step was required.I wondered what Microsoft (historically no paragon of concern for end-users) would say about the idea of deactivating firewalls to install software (invitation to a Trojan Horse?) and I thought I was in some kind of Kafkaesque scene at this point.  As I listened to the tech support person diligently explain why this was just standard procedure, I did not hear a single legitimate reason for this other than that this was what he was reading off of some crib sheet/checklist.  Well, against my better judgment I allowed the technician to persuade me that I should turn off the Windows firewall.  I was not terribly surprised when this did not make any difference, and again it seemed to fail at the same installation point.  The plot thickened from there. . .  The tech support person then insisted that our next step was to modify the Windows start-up sequence, essentially disabling startup of most of the startup software.  Not installing from safe mode, which would have been easier, but using MSConfig and manually disabling virtually everything in the startup sequence.  When I balked at that radical a step, and asked if they still supported older versions of Office (2003-7) to determine if this was worth all the grief, he indicated that DNS 13 would not work with anything but the newest versions of Office (2010-13)!  At that point,I decided that I had seen this modus operandi from Nuance before, and that it was best to simply withdraw from the install process.  I later found out that not only would I have had to turn off much of Windows 7 on startup, but I would have had to roll back multiple Windows updates to get DNS 13 installed.  Is this how good and reliable software is installed? I doubt it.  And if this is required at installation, what other bugs has Nuance left in the program's operation?Fortunately, after some trepidation about a similar scenario that might block me from getting back to where I had started, I was able to successfully reinstall DNS 11.5 (had to reinstall the original 11 version and then the 11.5 patch which was time-consuming), and then I began the cumbersome process of trying to get a refund from their Customer Service Department.  After a long wait on the phone, and some back and forth about why I couldn't use the program, and a sworn statement that I would remove it (they evidently didn't quite believe me that I couldn't install it so it didn't have to be removed!) the customer service person agreed to give me a refund, after informing me in solemn tones that ""any use of the program would result in my being prosecuted to the full extent of the law for copyright violation.""  Now I was almost convinced that I had stepped into a Kafka novel - closer to the true ethos and operating logic of Nuance.After all this back and forth, I now have DNS 11.5 once again working relatively okay, just locking up and taking Word with it occasionally, (just as it was prior to all this), and all I've lost is 4.5 hours of my time.  That was actually a huge relief, as losing this program would be a big setback.  It is after all the best, and the worst, of programs, and when it works well, it's a godsend, and I couldn't function professionally without it for long, given how much writing I have to do.If you put this issue of poor installation debugging together with the well-documented history of other forms of buggy operation (trashing of speech files, difficulties with upgrades, crashing of the core program and associated lock ups of Office - see the dozens of Amazon reviews of NS11/12 about all these issues), it's an impressive and undeniable record of real trouble. The proof of this - if you're doubtful - is plastered all over the Amazon reviews of their products. it's a product with an impressive history of polarized reviews - many people love it, because for one reason or another the bugs and problematic interactions did not emerge on their system (lucky folks), while other reviews document major problems and very low marks.  It's a mistake if either side in this debate sees the other side as 'wrong'.  It's just different experiences, based on different computer systems with different existing software and OS bases.  But the fact that a significant fraction of users have anywhere from major problems with the program to outright disasters speaks to the fact that the program is simply not adequately debugged.  It's not 1% of the users either, it's a significant fraction who can't install 13, and again if you don't believe me, just look at what's on the Amazon website. Most damning are the negative reports when users have to deal with technical support or have problems and are looking for solutions from Nuance.  I'd have to say that the cumulative record on Amazon in terms of user reviews in relationship to these types of situations is 75% negative.Here's my conclusion.  Nuance may have a total monopoly on good SR, and the various more recent issues of DNS 10-13 may work flawlessly for some users, but Nuance does not know what they are doing.  This is not to say that they can't create good or even great code.  Although the technicians creating the code base have been successful in carving additional accuracy from the program Over its various updates, the executive management at Nuance can't admit or acknowledge (and therefore can't fix) the program's buggy installation process (or its many other bugs and operational quirks, which have persisted from version to version).  What good does improved accuracy do you if the program can't be installed and uninstalled or upgraded without a lot of grief?  Or if you lose your speech files, and have to start all over after years of training and teaching the program?  Or if negative interactions with other common programs (or its own bugs) make the program unstable?It's possible that Dragon Naturally Speaking 13 is an absolute wonder  - the best yet - when it comes to actually translating your voice into accurate text in a variety of applications.  However, it's pretty clear to me that Nuance pays more attention to their press releases than they do to end-user reports.  Previous versions would not work with Adobe Flash, Microsoft Security Essentials (which appeared to sometimes treat NS 11-12 as a virus, making me wonder what operating system rules it was breaking!) and would sometimes trash or at least nick a Microsoft Office installation such that Office had to be reinstalled every once in a while.  Last but certainly not least, the program would sometimes eat its own user files, requiring that users go back to square one and teach the program from scratch (unless they saw this coming and made several backups - highly recommended to all you DNS users out there, as this has saved my bacon more than once).  I don't know if they have rectified these other various problems, but I've decided I don't want to find out.  And I simply can't afford to spend almost 5 hours installing a single program on a PC that works flawlessly all the rest of the time.I don't know what it will take for Nuance to change their approach, and create a more user-friendly installation process and debugged program, but I'm not optimistic, given that they have heard this complaint for years and it's clear that these basic and recurring problems are no better.  This unfortunately is just as important a fact about the program as its impressive accuracy.  It's a shame that Nuance operates with such impunity towards feedback from its core user base.  With a major cleanup organized by someone within the software team who wasn't complacent but instead was paying attention to repeated user reports, this program could someday be just as great as Nuance says it is.UPDATE: Two days after all this, and after making a post in a Nuance forum to see if anyone else had any insight into the install failure, I got a message back from a SR trainer and beta-tester for Nuance, who confirmed what I had already suspected about the fate of the post - that Nuance essentially censored any post in their forums that cast Nuance in anything less than an ideal light.  Instead of addressing the problem, validating the customers and their experiences as valuable data that had to be attended to, and thereby winning back any lost trust, their approach is to squelch dissent and negative press, rather than dealing with the underlying issues.  What more can one say, and what could be more damning about the operations of Nuance as a large corporation??","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QIPW7TJX99V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX4BYV6#wasThisHelpful","R11QIPW7TJX99V","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was initially something I thought was a bit of a gamble.  Dyson does not have the best reputation for reliability, and sure enough, the first copy (admittedly bought used) died unexpectedly for no apparent reason (would no longer turn on).  The second one – bought new – appears to be humming along.  It does a really great job in our summer condo where we have to go up and down multiple flights of stairs, and a plug-in vacuum simply is a nightmare.  It has excellent suction but somewhat short battery life, especially if it's run on the max or 'turbo' mode.  However on balance it's a great product – assuming this one doesn't die premature death also.  It gets an amazing amount of dirt out of rugs, it's amazingly convenient and way easier to use than any plug-in vacuum, it's fairly quiet, and it's very easy to empty, and you don't have to ever by any bags.  If it could be reliable, I might update this to five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7UTQ0ZDCLJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GN8UYA#wasThisHelpful","R1D7UTQ0ZDCLJ8","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The A77II is a solid upgrade to its predecessor (which was no slouch) with a number of solid functional improvements from the previous generation Alpha 77/65 models.  These include a better sensor, a deeper operating system, a much better autofocus system, a better JPEG engine from a better central processor, and several other tweaks.  Sony really did their homework on this upgrade to the A77, and they have done an excellent job squeezing at least another full f-stop or more out of the sensor relative to its predecessor - at least in JPEGs (but see the - typically - contentious debate in the comments section over this question of how much low light functioning has been improved).  I wouldn’t be surprised if the excellent Toshiba sensor in the Nikon 7100/5300 was their design target.  This means that the A77ii is now only ~ 0.7-1.5 f-stops below the Sony full frame 24 megapixel sensor (in the Sony A99 and Nikon 600/610), instead of its previous ~ 2+ stop disadvantage (the 610 being almost a full stop less noisy than the A99 presumably due to the effects of putting PD on chip as well as the SLT mirror).  The A77II is perhaps just under 3 stops below the phenomenal Sony A7S.  While that sounds like a lot, read on to see why this number can be misleading if taken too literally (and is also effectively reduced by several technologies in the A77II).  The short form of a long story on noise (discussed in detail below and in the comments sections) is that DxO numbers on noise (treated as canonical by many) aren’t the last word, and are only one (albeit valuable) metric on this important issue.For those not familiar with the difference between Sony’s approach to SLR technology vs. the traditional moving mirror, a fixed translucent mirror that doesn’t move replaces the standard SLR mirror that has to flop in and out of position in front of the sensor. That design difference is the key to the camera’s unique strengths (and its weaknesses in the minds of many purists). However, that single design difference allows the much faster and more accurate phase detection autofocus system to be working all the time, including while shooting movies, and thus gives you full time live view, much faster hi-speed shooting, and a lighter body, but also requires an electronic (non-optical) viewfinder, and with a modest ~30% loss of slight with some attendant noise penalty of roughly 1/2  F stop. Although a few purists bemoan the loss of a `true’ optical VF, and few others the 1/2  stop noise penalty, for most people looking for the best possible still photography and video, this is, at least in IMHO, a truly brilliant stroke that in one fell swoop removes some of the chronic limitations of the classic DSLR environs. If that noise penalty is a big deal, you are looking at the wrong camera (or you just have ‘noise OCD’).The A77 Mark II falls in the highly competitive territory of `prosumer’ or semi pro-cameras in the APS-C class, a class with features and capabilities just short of “all-out” full frame pro-cameras.  These semipro APS-C cameras are still plenty big, but not quite as big and hefty as the current full frame pro cameras by Sony, Canon and Nikon, particularly when you hang typical glass on them.  The full frame Nikon 810, Canon 5DIII, or even the Sony A99 (with a Canon L, Nikkor or Zeiss 24/70 mm lens in front of it) is overall a monster to tote around, for any extended period of time.  I had one of these (the A99) for a brief period of time, and as much as I loved its pictures, I decided that it was just too heavy to lug around, and my neck and back voted it out, even though it was a phenomenal camera (see Tim Naff’s review of the A99 on Amazon).  If you want to take a very modest step down in low light ability without giving up anything else and saving some not-inconsiderable size and weight - to say nothing of cost - this class of camera might be a best compromise solution.  This camera basically hits the sweet spot for me, making very small concessions in functionality to full frame equipment, while offering many professional grade features.Let’s talk history.  If you can put aside fan boy loyalties, a recent history of this class of cameras suggests that the Big Players have taken turns leapfrogging each other in relationship to what might be the best semi-pro camera.  When it came out in 2010, the Nikon 7000 was probably the best camera in this prosumer group.  When it first appeared in 2011, the Sony A77 probably displaced the Nikon 7000 as the best semiprofessional camera (although its low light performance was undeniably poor).  Olympus may have snagged the crown for a brief period with its OM-D E-M5 in 2012.  In 2013, Nikon returned the favor, with the Nikon 7100, which received high marks from Digital Photography Reviews and several other professional reviewers, and likely bumped both the previous generation A77 and the OM5 off the top spot.  I think that Sony has responded in kind and `held serve’.  As undeniably great as the Nikon 7100 is, I believe that overall, it still is not quite as good a camera as the A77ii, particularly if the A77ii is equipped with the Sony 16-50 2.8 lens (see my Amazon review of this very fine lens).  Competition has really been good for the class.  All this leapfrogging drives the real progress and just how far the prosumer group has come in four years.  The cameras keep getting better (more resolution AND more low light ability), while the price stays about the same.  Of course, this is happening in virtually all sectors of the DP world, as sensor design improvements keep moving the goalposts.  Compared with even a state of the art pro camera from 10-12 years ago, any of these APS-C or m4/3 cameras simply would be a revelation in detail, low light ability and features.  Indeed, any of the current generation APS-C or FF 24MP sensors will be equal with (or slightly out-resolve) Kodachrome 64 in bright light (my all time favorite film) while demolishing it in low light.Let’s talk pesos.  If you drop down from FF to APS-C, you’re saving a little over $1200 relative to a full frame camera body like the A99 (~ $2K if you are talking about a Nikon 810/Canon 5DIII). You are saving another $1250 on the best walk-around lens ($750 for the Sony 16-50 2.8 vs. the Zeiss 24-70 2.8 at $2000), and yet your only real sacrifice is about one F-stop in noise, but picking up an extra 6 frames per second and a waaaay deeper buffer for continuous shooting.  That’s an almost $2500-3300 cost for that ~ 0.7 (SonyA99) to 1.5 (Nikon610/SonyRX1) f-stop of noise relative to most FF bodies.  Sony’s in-body IS can effectively eliminate that margin if you are shooting FF on a non-stabilized lens (and may even exceed FF w/o IS).  That looks to me like a LOT of money for fairly slim margins.  As someone once said, it’s all about trade-offs - every technology is a series of compromises.  Outside of low light image quality, I’m simply not convinced that the A99 is a meaningfully better camera than the A77II - and the A99 is even surpassed by its little brother in several key functional areas: 1) better AF system, 2) way deeper buffer and 3) doubling up from 6 FPS on the A99 to 12 FPS.  It’s thus - arguably - a better sports camera than the A99.  Would I trade an A77II for an A99 even up?  Perhaps.  But in terms of a price (and especially weight?) dependent preference, the A77II with its 16-50 wins for me, as it is ~50% of the cost of an A99 with the CZ 24-70. Again, slim margins for a lot of money. (But if I was shooting for a living, those margins might suddenly be worth it . . .)Let’s talk weight.  Compared to an A99 with the Zeiss 24-70, the A77 with a 16-50 drops about 1.3 lbs of weight relative to its FF big brother, and ~ 2+ lbs if you comparing with a Nikon 800/810 with its 24-70 2.8. That weight REALLY adds up over time.  Carry the A99 with the 24-70 vs. the A77ii with the 16-50 for a full day while shooting, and you may feel that the weight penalty is WAY more punitive than the $2500 cost penalty.  Plus the A99 (and many other FF pro cameras) have no built-in flash, so you can add yet another lb at least, tacking on a flash unit if you need extra light.  That’s again a lot of weight for the same slim margins.Let’s talk about Sony’s recent track record in DP. Since buying Konica Minolta only 8 years ago, Sony has put out over 40 IL (interchangeable lens)cameras of various types, based on three fundamental design approaches: (initially) conventional DSLRs, but then transitioning to the SLT and the mirrorless E-mount models.  They didn’t stop there - offering three additional groundbreaking cameras with fixed lenses - the RX1 and then the RX100/RX10 - which raised the bar in terms of performance relative to camera size, followed up by the A7 series, which continued Sony’s approach in the RX line of stuffing the largest possible sensor in the smallest possible body.  Since 2010, many, if not most of these cameras have received Gold Awards by DPR totaling 11 Gold Awards in FOUR classes (3 RX models, 1 A7 model, 5 SLT models, 2 E-mount models), and three have won Pop. Photo. Camera of the Year (A55, NEX-7, A7r) - Sony taking this honor 3 out of the last 4 years by producing a camera in 3 of the 4 different classes.  To achieve this run of awards on just ONE class like the SLT models would be pretty impressive, but to do this in such quite different models of digital camera is clearly unprecedented.Let’s also be clear that I am not interested in promoting any version of `brand wars’, and that Olympus, Nikon, Fuji, Panasonic, and Canon all make great cameras (it’s a surfeit of riches in DP these days).  But whatever brand loyalties you might feel, one has to admit that this is an astonishing run of good form, almost out of nowhere, and starting from well behind the established players.  Although they started with major expertize in sensor design, as a major driver of this great run, Sony has also been more willing to take risks than any other DP player, while Nikon, and Canon even more so, seem relatively content to plod along with well-established formulas and take far fewer risks, and both have been more reluctant to move away from time-honored concepts of DSLR operation - witness their slow response to the explosion in mirrorless ILC, which is now being dominated by other players beside Canikon (specifically Olympus, Panasonic, Sony, Samsung and Fuji).  Very little has changed from these two dominant players in terms of the basic DSLR template in the last 15 years, excepting the basic addition of video ability, and while Canikon has sold over 85+% of all DSLRs, sales of this type of camera have been declining by roughly 10% per year over the last 3-4 years.  This suggests that some tweaking of these time honored formulas might be badly overdue. So if you are open to a brave and refreshing new approach in DLSR photography, you might carefully consider the A77ii.PROS (not rank ordered):1) Upgraded sensor, competitive with the new Toshiba sensor in the Nikon 7100/5300 and identical to the highly rated chip in the A6000 (presumably minus its phase detection circuitry).  Depending on one’s metric, between 1/3 and 3/4 stop (more or less) better in terms of noise relative to the 2011 24MP Sony chip in the previous generation A65/77. Combined with improved JPEG engine, at least a full stop if not 1.5 stops, less noise and/or loss of detail in JPEGs (see PRO #14).2) Upgraded autofocus system with 79 PD autofocus points, fast, and accurate.  Highly configurable within menu settings.  One of the best autofocus systems in the industry?  “Lock-on expand flexible spot” AF setting is a revelation for reliable object tracking.3) Excellent OLED EVF (2.4mp), quietly improved over from previous generation A77/65 (less over-contrasted, better low light functioning).  One of the best viewfinders in the digital world, with a big, bright and detailed view of your subject (but see cons).  Using this EVF is a revelation, compared to the sense of looking down a narrow, dark tunnel in any subframe OVF, esp. in low light, where the EVF simply separates from OVFs, even FF viewfinders. Offers live and immediate feedback on how your picture composition is going to change as shooting parameters are modified, and with many configuration options, including a great level, and all kinds of other useful information.4) Operating system can be heavily customized to individual preference with deep feature set (including excellent high dynamic range, low light and panorama modes).  Fine aperture priority mode (my personal preference), but camera can be easily run in full auto for those who are slightly technophobic and conversely can be tweaked to the Nth degree for the technophile.  Basic ergonomics are well thought out and mostly seamless with a deep menu system (but see cons).5) Decent lens options (although clearly less than CanNikon), particularly a very strong 16-50 2.8 Sony lens (see formal testing on Imaging Resource).  The 16-50 2.8 is one of the world’s best walk-around zoom lenses (with a 24-75mm equivalent view) out there, and a good reason in itself to buy a Sony Alpha camera.  Compares favorably with Canon L, Zeiss, Nikkor, and any other pro-grade glass.6) Full-time live view - leagues better than the tacked-on-afterthought version of live view on classic SLR mirrored cameras.  Way more responsive, way faster, and simply way better.  Again once you’ve used one of the Sony SLT systems, it’s hard to go back to the old way of doing live view.7) Full-time phase detection autofocus in movie mode, not available on most DSLRs (although an increasing number of manufacturers are using phase detection on chip to get around this limitation).  Sony’s approach is still better and the auto focus module (in certain modes) is quite effective at tracking moving subjects, and its parameters can now be user customized.8) Under-rated low light abilities, effectively belied by reviews which don’t consider 2 major issues impacting low light performance: IS and MF NR.  In-camera image stabilization means that EVERY lens you put on this camera is automatically image stabilized - IS system is worth ~ 2 stops .  This allows the camera to EXCEED full frame low light ability (FF on a non-stabilized lens) by ~ a full stop (more or less).  In addition to IS, there is a great multiframe noise reduction mode (4 shots in rapid succession with ~ 2 stops of noise smoothing/reduction). Put together, they translate into a combined ~ 3-3.5 stops of noise reduction between the IS and MF NR functionality (low light performance is not all DxO ISO RAW test numbers in other words - those numbers don’t reflect a single stop (!) of this ~ 3.5 stop functional advantage).9) Camera firmware corrects in JPEG for classic lens problems of chromatic aberration, barrel/pincushion distortion, and vignetting.  Most popular Sony lenses, including all the primes, the 16-50 2.8, and all the G lenses have built-in correction profiles.  Underrated plus (becoming a more common feature, but originally pioneered by Sony).10) In highly critical shooting, you don’t have to worry about mirror shake, mirror lockup and all of that nonsense.  This is a deceptively significant issue for the full frame cameras (big issue on the Nikon 800 but also in the APS-C camera group such as Nikon 7100 when trying to get maximum resolution out of the current generation of high-resolution sensors 24-36 megapixels).11) Everything on this camera is fast, not just its maximum burst rate (a class leading 12 frames per second) but its autofocus, menu operation, picture preview/scrolling, etc.12) Dramatically improved buffer depth means that that continuous shooting speed is now a meaningful statistic (as opposed to just advertizing), and you can capture a full 5 seconds at 12 frames per second (~60 shots in JPEG and ~24 shots in RAW).  Previous generation was hampered by very poor buffer depth which meant that its high shooting speed was really more academic than meaningful (a real plus over the Nikon 7100 which is hampered by the same design limitation.)  Combined with its improved autofocus tracking, now a real sports camera.13) As an adjunct to the great autofocus system, you can adjust the AF for lenses that are back- or front-focusing.  Almost every lens can benefit, and this fixed a chronic problem for me with two lenses.14) A much better JPEG engine - this applies both sharpening and noise reduction in a more context-dependent fashion.  Combined with a less noisy sensor, this allows for usable JPEGs at ISO settings where the previous gen A77/65 images were just a blotchy mess.  I would estimate that AT LEAST a full f-stop, if not 1.5 stops of extra usability.  I used to cringe at having to shoot past ISO 1600, now I feel comfortable going to 6400 for smaller prints or if I’m working in RAW. (Part of the debate over how much the new camera is really better at low light emerges from confusion and conflation of RAW noise (where the A77ii appears 1/3 to 1/2 stop better in DXO testing), vs how much JPEGs are noisy/blotchy and/or losing detail from heavy NR.)  Sony’s new JPEG engine is now simply a notch better than Nikon’s or Canon’s, and approaches (but probably doesn’t quite equal) the benchmark Olympus engine in creating useful and clean JPEGs. (Skeptics - please feel free to look at test images on DPR - pull up their image comparometer tool and look at Nikon 7100, Canon 7Dii, Olympus OMD1 and Sony A6000 JPEGs at ISO 6400). The JPEG engine is also easily adjustable - contrast, sat and sharpness easily tweaked for personal preference.  And speaking of sharpness, given that Sony sets the engine on a rather smooth default, it’s easy to go to 2+ sharpening without any artifacts (3+ starts to show some sharpening halos).CONS (rank ordered in descending order of seriousness IMO):1) No 4K video - and no option for the new highly efficient H.265 (HEVC) codec (~ half the file size of the previous gen H.264).  The lack of support for 4K is my #1 real gripe/disappointment and a potentially glaring omission (see Canon FF and Panasonic GH4).  ? fixable in future firmware.  If Samsung’s new PHONE has 4K video for Pete sakes, why can’t this camera??  Another baffling example of “Sony Think”??  Were they just protecting sales of their 4K camcorders?  Given that Samsung’s new flagship NX1 supports 4K onto SD cards (along with several Canon and Olympus models), this looks like a glaring omission, although Sony has company on this point (Nikon).  Very doubtful that new firmware will change this.2) Despite upgrade to the Bionz X processor used in all their new cameras, video still uses `line skipping’ of previous generation cameras (not to be confused with interlacing).  This essentially means that the Sony RX 100 III (which samples the full frame to generate a 1080p image instead of the older line skipping approach) will have somewhat better video than the Sony A77II.  This is a baffling omission, and I doubt that this will be fixable via a simple firmware update.3) Less rich system ecology for the professional photographer compared to Canon-Nikon.  In particular, lens options are considerably less impressive than CanNikon, particularly as you get into telephoto zooms.  But  . . . . .  support is improving (excellent battery pack, external mic, and other accessories for pro-level shooting and videography).4) Still no low light phenom in RAW and at least 1 f-stop or more from many FF cameras (but not counting the 2 stops from IS and the 2 stop reduction possible in MF NR).5) Sony’s Play Memories smartphone interface software, at least its current generation, can only be described as a pathetic effort with little real functionality, due to its forcing the camera into a very vanilla AUTO mode where you have absolutely no control over anything.  Even after updating my phone operating system (previous generation OS rejected all efforts at Wi-Fi pairing with camera), connection is not very reliable, including a relatively unstable connection with Wi-Fi enabled TVs - see extended discussion of these issues in the last section.6) Clear tendency to overexpose, in bright light but not so much in low light?  Confounding your ability to accurately judge exposure level, the addition of a white pixel in the LCD (their new “White Magic” LCD panel) may be making the screen appear overly bright and making images appear even more overexposed than they might otherwise be - even on a screen that has not had its brightness ramped up to deal with a bright environment.  Speaking of overexposure, flash exposure is also consistently over-boosted, and this takes place independently of ~0.3 EV-0.7EV overexposure in very bright light.  I have to dial back flash exposure to -1.0 EV to get balanced images.  This is particularly disappointing, given that the previous generation A 77/65 struggled with this despite multiple firmware updates aimed at this problem - but it was never truly resolved.  Additionally, if you use TTL exposure control on flash as opposed to the newer ADI modality (these are menu selectable), you are more likely to get significant flash exposure variation on top of overexposure.  The flash overexposure is relatively easily corrected however in the Fx menu.7) Lack of true complete control over shooting parameters in movie mode.  Still can’t fully control ISO and aperture unless in manual focus?  WUWT?8) EVF can still struggle under exceptionally bright conditions, although now with a greater range of brightness adjustment, this usually can now be accommodated. (In low light, this EVF is actually easier to see your subject through than OVF due to gain provided)9) Loss of GPS and IR focus assist in low light (the latter presumably not needed as much).  Balanced by WiFi and NFC? A good tradeoff for most but a bummer for those who loved the GPS feature.10) Another tradeoff around the adoption of the ISO standard hot shoe - good for everybody new to the brand, except those of us with the old Minolta type flash mounts?  Fixable with neat little Sony adapter.11) No touch screen functionality.  Bigger issue for some than for others.  Might have been nice to have lock on AF points/tracking adjustable from touchscreen.12) Rather big and heavy for APS-C camera?  Not far in weight from Nikon 750, which offers significantly better sensor/low light ability.13) Menu structure is complex, not well explained by the manual, requiring menu diving.  Gary Friedman is best resource for learning complex OS.AREAS WHERE THE A-77II SERIOUSLY NEEDS WORK/UPDATES.In terms of things that Sony has to fix, (if possible) they need to first adopt the full sensor sampling approach on 1080p video that other Bionz X processor cameras enjoy (such as the newly released RX-100 III), and also, if possible, actually support 4K video.  Those are both big issues in my judgment, and I am very disappointed not just by the lack of support for 4K video, but the apparent use of the older line skipping approach, which generated a combination of moiré and poor resolution on the earlier generation cameras.  It does raise questions - is Sony unable to do full sensor sampling on this generation of APS-C sensors, even with this upgraded processor?  If it can’t do full sensor sampling at 1080p, 4K support seems highly unlikely from the standpoint of computational power.Then there is the dismal performance of the Play Memories software - software which generally gets very poor marks on Internet reviews.  Now that I actually have it working after updating my phone OS, I can see why.  After working with the PlayMemories Remote Control by Smartphone feature, I have to conclude that whoever designed this was well, to put it bluntly, an idiot.  On the A77II, but not the RX100iii (the version for the RX100 has WAY more functionality and is actually far more useful!!), you can’t ever shoot from the operational mode you’re in, and it defaults to the most vanilla AUTO mode possible.  This comes complete with total loss of control over ISO, f-stop, etc. including any adjustment you might have made to the flash exposure problem - so if the flash comes out - you guessed it automatically - count on overexposed pictures.  AND, you can’t EVER delete pictures - and to boot, Sony hides the captured files in their own folder, doesn’t allow you to change that folder assignment (like putting them in one of your existing picture folders (!) or anything common sense that like that, so you can’t surf through your pictures with the normal Android picture viewing tools.  So the functionality of “PlayMemories” as anything more than just a remote viewing screen (or as a `gee wiz’ feature to impress your non-technical spouse or friends) is just about ZERO from my perspective. It’s simply a pathetic effort by Sony and makes me wonder if beta testing on this was done by photographic amateurs, as anyone with even a passing competence in the camera’s operating system would have nixed such a regression to pure vanilla AUTO mode, to say nothing of the dismal file handling.  To have such a poorly thought out software interface offered on Sony’s flagship APS-C camera is truly a shock - and it suggests that this software package was cobbled together, in a rush, and at the last second, to get something out with the camera so Sony could claim the A77II is Wi-Fi friendly.  It is evidence that the more things change, the more they stay the same with Sony. Brilliant hardware design paired with (occasionally) infuriating lack of attention to operational details - esp. on the software side. It is a painful contrast with, for example, Apple’s ability to integrate software and hardware seamlessly. Sometimes these operational bugs don’t intrude or get trimmed out, but when they exist, they are often very frustrating.  I am stunned that the Play Memories software functionality for the RX100III is orders of magnitude better and is genuinely useful.  What is Sony thinking, in producing a highly useful version (!) on their smallest serious camera while shorting their APS-C flagship?Conclusions:Sony, despite mixed reviews on this point in relationship to some past products, appears to have been actually listening in relationship to the SLT line.  Sometimes other dubious design decisions appeared impervious to user feedback, but in relationship to the Alpha 77, they apparently listened to user complaints and addressed every single issue, improving its low light noise, its autofocus, and its buffer depth, while keeping and even enhancing the previous generation camera’s considerable feature set and strengths.  It still gives up a little bit of resolution to the Nikon 800/810 and Sony A7r, and concedes a little bit of lowlight ability to all the full frame cameras, but only ~ one stop now instead of ~ 2 stops.  With some non-stabilized lenses on full frame, the A77ii with full time IS is going to exceed those FF low light abilities by ~ a full stop, give or take (not counting low light phenoms like the Sony A7S and the Nikon D4S).  This IS system, particularly combined with the multiframe noise reduction mode, largely mitigates the camera’s main physical performance limitation relative to FF (with IS alone, it beats my RX-1 in low light by ~ a stop).  Those stuck to quoting DxO numbers as canonical (see debate on this in comments section) miss completely how many effective f-stops worth of noise reduction are created by IS conjoined with MFNR (~ 3+ stops), which means that instead of being forced to use ISO 12800 for a low light shot using an non-stabilized lens on a FF (like the phenomenal low light A7S), I can shoot at the noise equivalent of ISO 1600.  This camera at ISO 1600 beats (or at least ties) SNR of even the Sony A7S at 12800.  So all you noise-phobic types out there (I count myself in that group) concerned about the poor low light reputation of the previous gen A77/65, RELAX.  Once you learn how to exploit the full potential of all the technologies in this system, you will be astonished at what low light shooting you can do.  Obviously, it’s still no Nikon D4S or Sony A7S, but indoor and night shooting (without flash) have been surprisingly productive options for me, with many excellent images using either just IS, or IS conjoined with MF NR.My one major disappointment is the apparent failure to upgrade the video sampling approach (to the full frame sampling seen in the RX100iii and RX10) and the obvious absence of a 4K video option (as I think 4K is going to explode over the next two years, as 4K sets are already entering the mainstream).  I am also seriously disappointed that Sony released a version of PM (Play Memories) smartphone control interface for the camera that is notably inferior to what’s available on the RX-100III (could simply be an A77II firmware limitation rather than restrictions of PM software on the phone side?), and I remain puzzled by Sony’s ongoing difficulties with flash exposure control and apparent bright light overexposure.  None of this detracts from the great pictures (now that I have the slightly manic flash settings tamed), but one wishes that Sony sweated the operational details a bit more in this first firmware release.  Most of these various issues can be fixed by firmware updates and/or updates to PlayMemories software, or at least let’s hope so.  Despite these issues, if the tradeoffs of APS-C make sense to you, I have to believe that you will love the A77ii.  Highly recommended overall, as perhaps the most well-rounded APS-C camera. Real competition for the Canon 7Dii, the Nikon 7100/7200 and the Samsung NX1 as the elite players in the APS-C field.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VA7U0C2KASJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0BYLN6#wasThisHelpful","R2VA7U0C2KASJR","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After spending endless time reviewing articles and talking with several camera and photography professionals, I took the plunge, and finally moved up from a point and shoot super zoom (one of the small Nikon P80s) (with the very generous aid of my lovely wife as a birthday present).  It has been truly a revelation, in terms of both video and photo quality.  Like everything else, it's all about tradeoffs.  The larger APS-C sensor (in most digital SLRS and larger format point and shoots) means a bigger body, more weight, larger lenses, and of course more money, but also means much better low light performance, higher detail, and faster performance.But what Sony has done with their APS-C sensor (and by the way they make the sensor that Nikon uses in the 5100 and several other Nikon SLRs) is nothing short of brilliant.  First of all, the idea of a translucent mirror that doesn't have to move, and that therefore provides constant live view and constant phase detection autofocus in movie mode (and also provides 10 frames per second high speed shooting to boot) was a stroke of genius - you do have give up the through the lens view (but get a bright electronic viewfinder that is bigger and brighter than all but the very best SLR prisms and is 'through the lens' too but derived from the sensor).The whole design is well executed, rich with useful (as opposed to gimmicky) features, and provides a rich operating system for those upgrading from small digital cameras, while offering most of the traditional virtues of SLRs.  Software provided by Sony is also quite good, offering many useful editing and other features.Bottom Line -- you get better movie ability and the same photo capability of most of the best mid-range dSLRs, and with a richer feature set.Pros:1) Has won numerous awards (a rare Gold Award from Digital Photography Review, 2010 Camera of the Year from Popular Photography, rave review from Imaging Resources) due to its great feature set, performance, and value for the money2) Great movie capability (excepting one major and one minor issue)3) Great photo capability with many useful modes and special features (including a super panorama mode and a 10 fps high speed mode)4) Easy to use for someone with modest technical ability5) Flexible and powerful for someone with more technical ability willing to master the multiple modes and functions6) Best LCD panel in the price range, fully articulated7) Sony's lenses are relatively cheap and fairly light weight with decent optics and performance (compared with Canon & Nikon)8) Good (and fast) autofocus9) Neatest feature (among many) - automatic activation of electronic viewfinder and deactivation of LCD by proximity to the eyepiece -- EVF turns on as you get near it)Cons:1) When using IS (image stabilization) in movie mode, camera sensor heats up quickly, limiting movie length to a few minutes (29 minutes max without IS)2) Modest battery life, esp. if you use the great LCD a lot (can be turned off)3) Limited control in movie mode, and only two file formats (AVCHD AND MP4) and three file resolutions4) Limited playback options for movie files from within the camera5) Mild tendency towards overexposure in bright conditions (easily corrected)6) Movies can get lens noise introduced, requiring external mic for best sound","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNSD2NVF7MIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043DKBTK#wasThisHelpful","R2BNSD2NVF7MIF","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was initially torn between buying this lens with an A55, or buying the 18-55 mm standard kit lens and having a little bit less flexibility but a lot less weight.  Although the weight is sometimes a burden, I certainly appreciate the 14 X zoom range, from moderate wide-angle to pretty decent telephoto without having to change lenses.  I haven't seen a lot of problems with chromatic aberration, but I haven't shot too many exposures with the lens all the way out (largely because its just too soft there).  These long range zoom lenses are always compromises between the convenience of having such a wide range of focal lengths, vs. the sharpness and accuracy of a single focal length lens.  Overall, and on balance, I highly recommend this lens to people who value not changing lenses (nothing worse than missing a great shot while you're fiddling with your equipment).  If you are thinking about getting this, I recommend getting it with the camera and saving some major money over buying it later.  At $599 (list), it's not cheap.  Its effective cost when bought with the A55 camera body is a lot less (~$300) - this is a great deal (typically $1050 for this lens and the A55). See great review at Imaging Resource for details on sharpness, CA etc.  That review suggests that it is a major improvement on its predecessor (the 18-200 mm), and generally pretty sharp for this type of lens.Pro:1) 14 x range from moderate wide angle to moderate telephoto makes this a very convenient package2) good but not great sharpness, esp. if stopped down a bit (f5.6 up to about f8/f11 where it reaches its max sharpness), and particularly sharp at wider angles for a large zoom3) good build quality and solid construction - won't compete with G series pro lenses, but still quite well made and good value4) fast focusing (at least for big lens)5) Not bad CA, distortion and vignetting (UPDATE - when used with the A77 or A65, these are effectively removed by the firmware-based corrections, which are quite effective in cancelling out CA, and corner shading effects are virtually eliminated too. (See my review of the Alpha 65Con:1) Not impressive sharpness at telephoto end - wouldn't recommend if you plan on shooting a lot there (120-250mm), even stopped down2) Some troubles with chromatic aberration, esp. again at telephoto end (but again virtually eliminated by A65/A77 firmware)3) Heavy (might overwhelm small, light camera bodies like the A55/A33/A33 - works better with bigger bodies like A65 and up)4) Wish it traded some of its reach at the telephoto end for going down to 16 mm at the wide-angle end","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TT6P36XGFZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VUFDPG#wasThisHelpful","R35TT6P36XGFZX","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:1) capable of decent accuracy with modest training, and very good accuracy with more extended training2) can keep up with relatively fast speaking meaning overall excellent speed of text generation3) capacity to train multiple users and work within multiple dialectsCons:1) unreliable, crash prone, and buggy - this program needs major work2) poorly sorted out Windows 7 correction dialog operations (ultra-slow)3) program becomes unstable when microphone is turned off for protracted periods of time, requiring reinitialization and reloading.4) program support is a joke - Nuance has to be the most arrogant software company in the world despite some hard working staffers (yup - worse than Microsoft!)It's almost impossible to be on the Internet or working with the computer and not be aware of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking 11.0. You would think from the relentless advertisement by Nuance that the program never makes a mistake, and allows seamless control of your computer while allowing you to dictate virtually everything. Unfortunately, the hype and promise fall well short of the program's actual functioning.Although quite good accuracy is possible with modest levels of training, and very good accuracy is possible in technical fields with training of technical vocabulary, the program's buggy operation, recurrent vulnerability to crashing, humongous speech files and subsequent painfully slow loading, and very slow correction interface (much lower for some reason on Windows 7 than on Windows XP) spoil an otherwise enjoyable experience badly.Although I am almost totally dependent on the program for professional writing (cranking out roughly 20 single spaced pages a day in a scientific area), I am continually amazed with how many rough edges the program has that Nuance seems to be oblivious to, because they recur from edition to edition. As but a small example of lack of attention to relevant details, the program within Microsoft Word does not use the specialized characters for quotation marks, but uses a generic and plainer character set, instead of the one generated within Microsoft Word. This means that if you want professional looking final product, you have to run a macro to replace their generic quotation marks with the proper special character. Although this is a small issue, it's just an example of so many ways in which the program falls down, and displays its lack of polish. It is amazing that despite five editions of the product which I have used that this issue continues, despite feedback from multiple users.Then there is the issue of loading and speed of operation. With a solid-state drive that gets to the Windows 7 desktop in 20 seconds, it takes 25 seconds to load speech files on NaturallySpeaking 11.0. In other words, an extremely fast hard drive loads a bloated operating system faster than it loads NaturallySpeaking 11.0. I hesitate to think how long it would take somebody to load speech files on the average 250 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. You could go out, mow your lawn, calculate your taxes, then do your email, and come back just in time to start dictating.Well, so what? Once the program is loaded, things should be okay, right? Well this is where again the program falls down. First of all, actually correcting things reveals a major bug in their Windows 7 code around keyboard input within the corrections dialog box. When you bring up the correction dialog box, you can't type characters without generating a long delay before the program somehow incorporates your keyboard input (roughly 10-12 seconds) - this is unacceptable waiting time for entering a couple of characters. Dictating or spelling out words within the correction dialog box produces somewhat snappier results, but is still amazingly slow, (again running this program on an extremely fast processor, with 6 GB of RAM, and one of the fastest 250 GB solid-state drives). It's scary to imagine how slow this program would be on the average system. In fairness, some of it appears to be a Windows 7 incompatibility, because I use the same speech files and the same 11.0 version on a Windows XP system, and had much snappier response from within the corrections dialog box. Of course Nuance advertises that their code is Windows 7 compatible - something got lost in the translation. But again, this suggests that Nuance is more concerned with their advertising than with the program's actual performance.  This is a continuing theme - Nuance's grandiosity gets continually in the way of their ability to see any problems with the program (or their support - which is clearly an industry low-water mark).The biggest problem though is what happens when you put the program (at least 11.0 - corrected in 11.5) into Suspend by turning off the microphone- and by the way, you are forced to do this because if you simply tell the program to ""go to sleep"" any sound into the microphone will cause the page to scroll back to where the cursor is (in other words any kind of sound acts as a reinitialization command to the cursor - the logic behind that completely escapes me! So essentially you are forced to suspend microphone input if you want to scroll through your text instead of the program intrusively interfering with this. This is where things get really interesting (after you turn the microphone off). After about 5 min., the program will malfunction (again only in Windows 7 and not in Windows XP for some strange reason) and give you an error code which the program cannot recover from, and thus all this nonsense requires that you basically start from scratch all over again. This means not simply reloading the program, because the program actually doesn't pull itself out of memory reliably and oftentimes leaves a huge executable sitting in the background (taking up over 300 MB of RAM) - - if you don't kill the program this way, when you try to reinitialize it, you will immediately get the same error code. This means you have to bring up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files. This will again take a long period of time - close to 30 seconds with a solid-state drive, A minute and a half with a slow conventional hard drive. All of this nonsense of course significantly deteriorates the productivity advantage associated with dictating versus typing. Indeed, for short pieces of text, all these hassles mean that it is almost always faster to simply type out a couple of paragraphs then it is to struggle with the program. For longer text generation, and assuming that you dictate continuously and don't risk putting the microphone into the off position for any extended period, the program is more productive and faster than typing.This process of recurrent shutdown and reinitializing (due to fatal program errors) can be very frustrating, and oftentimes has to be repeated multiple times, because if you leave the program on (by not turning off the microphone), and there is any background noise you'll get endless junk words into your dictation space. This brings up another striking failure of the program - its total inability to discriminate speech from background sounds and non-speech noises. The program seems to believe that every conceivable sound must translate into a word, and therefore, any kind of background noise makes it impossible to use the program particularly if you are not using a noise canceling microphone, and instead are dictating on a laptop that has a standard integrated microphone. You would think that the program, which runs on an enormous number of laptops, would be optimized for the standard integrated microphones on laptops. Unfortunately, it is not. You have to use Dragon's headphone microphone gear or some equivalent. Curiously, a much earlier version of the program NaturallySpeaking 8.0 seem to work much better with laptop microphone arrays. Why this might be is beyond me.Because the program code is buggy and unreliable and subsequently the program locks up, you will find that occasionally your speech files are completely trashed and cannot be repaired through Nuance's repair algorithms (there is a speech file Restore function from within the program). This means you had better make a backup copy of your speech files (make that several backup copies), or you will find yourself having to retrain your user identity all over again, from scratch. Additionally, you will find that their optimization program (which gives you the chance to optimize speech files that have had numerous corrections made to them) is not reliable and also locks up regularly.  And BTW, its continual crashing will occasionally damage programs with which it is linked, such as Word and Outlook, requiring re-installation of those as well.  In other words, this program does not play nice with your system.In case you're suspicious that these difficulties are unique to my machine, or are a function of viruses, spyware, or other hardware problems, rest assured that none of these issues are remotely responsible for the Programs buggy and unreliable operation. I run two spyware and antivirus programs concurrently, my system is about as fast as a window 7 system can be (Windows experience index 6.7 overall), and I always keep the machine in good working order.  Just to clarify, I do tech support for most of my friends on their Windows 7 and Windows XP systems - so the problem isn't that I have a damaged Windows installation that is to blame for these issues.All of these operational headaches spoil what otherwise might be a useful program. I believe that all of this emerges from Nuance having a very grandiose notion about their software, and not really listening very much to end-users. It's a shame that there is no real competition in the PC marketplace when it comes to dictation software. If there was, I suspect Nuance would have to get their act together because they would quickly lose market share. Given all these issues, 2/5 stars is actually generous. I wish I could make do without the program, or transition to another speech recognition platform, but unfortunately I can't.Oh, I almost forget the best part: don't expect Nuance to know anything about any of these issues.  They have some of the worst technical support I have ever seen in the industry.  They blame your system and your computer and claim there are no deficiencies in their program(!).ADDENDUM:Dragon 11.5 has just been released and after several weeks - I can see that Nuance has fixed some things, but not touched many others.  It no longer crashes as frequently, or generates bizarre error codes as frequently, requiring that it has to be re-initialized regularly - although that still happens.  It loads somewhat more quickly.  However, it continues to interpret every sound as speech, has a painfully slow corrections dialog, and as per the norm, reaching technical support is like trying to call the Dept. of Defense and you don't have technical support past 90 days.  It is painfully obvious that Nuance has no real handle on the program's deficiencies, and therefore it is a 2/5 star program.  I can't recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HRS98W1TYYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNCROU#wasThisHelpful","R35HRS98W1TYYZ","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is less likely to lock up, although Microsoft Security Essentials doesn't seem to like this program, and sometimes you will have to stop MSE from running to dictate (perhaps MSE regards this as a virus!)  Corrections are reasonably snappy, if you disable playback, or curiously, use an external mic.  Not clear why the choice of microphone effects speed of operation of the corrections dialog box but it does.  Nuance's support is still terrible.

"This page contains a number of major misconception from people buying this drive, the biggest one being that one has to install the OS from scratch to get best performance and have the partitions aligned under Win 7.  This isn't true at all, and one can both align and clone system partitions simultaneously using Acronis boot disk.  It is the only disk cloning program to my knowledge that has this functionality.This is one of the fastest drives under SATA II and the fastest SATA III drive, although this is not meaningful for many systems with the older drive controllers.  Boot times relative to a fast conventional 7200 rpm hard drive are more than cut in half, from about 1:10 to 25 seconds.  Best investment one can make in your system's performance.  Don't waste money on a faster processor and save it by getting a conventional hard drive - faster CPUs make very little difference most of the time - faster drives on the other hand, make a big difference in almost anything the system has to do.

"Pros:1) powerful hardware, great screen, Blu-ray, etc.2) reasonable weight for 17.3 inch desktop replacement system.3) Windows 7 versus Windows XP.4) decent sound system, and great picture when playing back Blu-ray discs - good entertainment laptop.5) not too much bloatware relative to some other HP products.6) superfast (with Crucial SSD drive - much cheaper to install it yourself after-market) - loads Windows in 15-20 seconds, and most programs almost instantly.7) attractive appearance and presentation, decent keyboard (backlit).8) decent job with the improved management of heat, which plagued the Envy 15 series.9) good enough video card capability for serious gamingCons:1) tricky trackpad - it's supposed to work similar to a Mac trackpad with two finger scrolling etc., but that's not the case. Much improved with non-HP software (why doesn't HP have it?), but still tricky to use.2) Windows 7 versus Windows XP - lots of eye candy but still a buggy OS3) less than stellar battery life (even with solid-state drive). About 1.5 hours on standard 6-cell battery under minimal load.4) 7.5 pounds - not the most portable laptop.5) HP's legendary bad service (fortunately haven't needed them yet)6) difficulties cloning Windows 7 system partitions7) poor reliability of HP blu-ray software - frequent lock upsThis is a substantially revised review, after three months with the machine.After a long period of review and analysis of sources on the Internet about desktop replacement systems, I came to the conclusion that of all the desktop replacement systems, the Envy 17 was probably the most powerful system for the money out there, although it was a close contest relative to the F series Sony laptop, which also is an appealing system.I was able to get a fire-sale price on a fairly loaded new Envy. I deliberately avoided the i7 quad core processor because of the heat issues (glad I did, and the system doesn't really get that hot). I got a reasonably fast i5, both to get better battery life and less heat. Additionally, it is a big (and common) mistake to think that a faster processor is really going to make a difference compared to a much faster SSD drive - save money on the getting the cheaper CPU and spend it instead on the SSD. Heat is a primary concern, more in relationship to people doing gaming, because the video card does contribute significantly to the heat output (the CPU and GPU seem to share a common heat sink). Unfortunately, there is no option to switch between less energy intensive motherboard graphics, and a dedicated video card when you need the extra processing power, a feature that Apple has exploited with significant returns on battery life.The biggest source of frustration unquestionably is the trackpad, which is almost unusable (with stock HP software) at least by anyone with average dexterity. If you're willing to get an outboard mouse, it's a lot better, but of course that means you can't have this system on your lap anymore because it's tough to manipulate a mouse under those circumstances.One frustrating scenario was that initially, despite using literally four different disk copying programs, I was unable to clone the system partition to a solid-state drive.

"Pros:1) powerful hardware, great screen, Blu-ray, etc.2) reasonable weight for 17.3 inch desktop replacement system.3) Windows 7 versus Windows XP.4) decent sound system, and great picture when playing back Blu-ray discs - good entertainment laptop.5) not too much bloatware relative to some other HP products.6) superfast (with Crucial SSD drive - much cheaper to install it yourself after-market) - loads Windows in 15-20 seconds, and most programs almost instantly.7) attractive appearance and presentation, decent keyboard (backlit).8) decent job with the improved management of heat, which plagued the Envy 15 series.9) good enough video card capability for serious gamingCons:1) tricky trackpad - it's supposed to work similar to a Mac trackpad with two finger scrolling etc., but that's not the case.  Much improved with non-HP software (why doesn't HP have it?), but still tricky to use.2) Windows 7 versus Windows XP - lots of eye candy but still a buggy OS3) less than stellar battery life (even with solid-state drive).  About 1.5 hours on standard 6-cell battery under minimal load.4) 7.5 pounds - not the most portable laptop.5) HP's legendary bad service (fortunately haven't needed them yet)6) difficulties cloning Windows 7 system partitions7) poor reliability of HP blu-ray software - frequent lock upsThis is a substantially revised review, after three months with the machine.After a long period of review and analysis of sources on the Internet about desktop replacement systems, I came to the conclusion that of all the desktop replacement systems, the Envy 17 was probably the most powerful system for the money out there, although it was a close contest relative to the F series Sony laptop, which also is an appealing system.I was able to get a fire-sale price on a fairly loaded new Envy. I deliberately avoided the i7 quad core processor because of the heat issues (glad I did, and the system doesn't really get that hot).  I got a reasonably fast i5, both to get better battery life and less heat.  Additionally, it is a big (and common) mistake to think that a faster processor is really going to make a difference compared to a much faster SSD drive - save money on the getting the cheaper CPU and spend it instead on the SSD.  Heat is a primary concern, more in relationship to people doing gaming, because the video card does contribute significantly to the heat output (the CPU and GPU seem to share a common heat sink).  Unfortunately, there is no option to switch between less energy intensive motherboard graphics, and a dedicated video card when you need the extra processing power, a feature that Apple has exploited with significant returns on battery life.The biggest source of frustration unquestionably is the trackpad, which is almost unusable (with stock HP software) at least by anyone with average dexterity.  If you're willing to get an outboard mouse, it's a lot better, but of course that means you can't have this system on your lap anymore because it's tough to manipulate a mouse under those circumstances.One frustrating scenario was that initially, despite using literally four different disk copying programs, I was unable to clone the system partition to a solid-state drive.  Kept getting a strange error code, as though the system couldn't find the boot partition.  Fortunately, I was finally able to track down the error code, and it turns out there is a ready fix - but only if you know how to use the repair functionality within the Windows install disk - how does Microsoft manage to make the simplest things such a freaking hassle and sell so many copies of their OS?.With all the hassles, I initially struggled to decide between three versus four stars, and finally settled on four.

"We have had this system now for over a year, hence, this is now a significantly modified review.We originally took the plunge and bought this for the family computer, despite HP's dismal service record.  So far so good, and after one year, no problems except for a strange period when the operating system was running at ultra-low speed, corrected by a system restore.  Not a single issue in terms of hardware, or major Windows operating system problems.  I suppose we have been lucky at least compared to what is described with other HP quality control issues.  Or maybe they finally have started to get their act together.  The automatic driver and other software update functions built into HP Advisor have actually worked flawlessly.  Additionally, there is not a single dead pixel, or other problem with the screen, which is gorgeous, and when this is combined with a good blu-ray player, and a better-than-average sound system, this is clearly a great laptop for watching Blu-ray movies.  It's not a bad laptop for gaming also given a decent video card, although we don't do much of that, so no real experience there.There is an occasional problem with fan noise, when the system is working hard.  However, this is not really a knock on this particular laptop because Intel's i7 quad core processors put out a lot of heat, and you are going to get fan noise in that context.  I'm sure the substantial power consumption, even at idle, by the quad core processor is also responsible for the system's lousy battery life.  All in all it's very powerful hardware, and so far, bug-free software and operating system in a big package.  We are going to make one substantial upgrade sometime this winter, in terms of replacing the mechanical hard drive with a solid-state drive, as Win 7 is huge OS with large files, requiring very fast hard drive for snappy operation - probably twice the overhead of XP.  Fingers crossed on that piece of minor surgery - have heard many horror stories about SSD upgrades and attempts to clone OS partitions.So to summarize, it's a big (REALLY big), fast system, and with a great feature set particularly for the money.  Windows 7 appears to be finally relatively debugged for a first release (much better than Vista in that regard).  Lots of OS eye candy, in terms of the Aero features.  If you're looking for a desktop replacement, and one that's going to be mostly plugged in to the wall most of the time, and you need a lot of features and don't mind the weight, this looks like a good PC system for the money.I can't really say whether HP's reputation for dismal customer service is deserved, because we simply haven't needed any.Pros:1) fast and capable - good desktop replacement system (can move around the house and office).2) rich feature set: high-definition screen (1920x1010), Blu-Ray, 7200 RPM hard drive, full keyboard, several other bells and whistles3) Windows 7 appears to be pretty reliable (so far!)4) neat fingerprint reader (definitely a gimmick for some, but it makes switching between password-protected users accounts somewhat easier)5) reliable hardware (so far, after on year)6) flawless updating of drivers and other operating system components through HP AdvisorCons:1) we did say it was big (honking would be more like it). Not very portable, and not for traveling.2) poor battery life, at most about 1:45 (not sure why, given that we bought the larger battery which of course adds to the svelteness).3) HP's legendary service (generally regarded as about as bad as it gets), but we haven't had to use their service (yet).4) Windows 7 is a beast - requires very fast hard drive and system to run even reasonably fast.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0W0V7DA8RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00310PG32#wasThisHelpful","RN0W0V7DA8RX","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After trying several USB powered Blu-Ray players (none of which worked reliably), I was skeptical that this one would be any different.  However I was pleasantly surprised in that it appears to play virtually any Blu-ray disc, as long as one has an updated player (Blu-ray codecs for some reason appear to be a rapidly moving target and updated versions of Power DVD are virtually required to get any kind of consistent playback).  What's nice about this one is that it actually gets enough power just from the USB port, and doesn't require an outboard transformer like some other ones.  The included software package includes Cyberlink's Power DVD 9.0, and some reasonable disk making software.  Would definitely recommend over the competition.  At least Asus seems to care about hardware reliability when a lot of people don't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDFN2BTFKI9TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A7X7WI#wasThisHelpful","RDFN2BTFKI9TD","A2MVF3CEV2DZQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MVF3CEV2DZQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first - let's face it, the sequels to the original (and riveting) Predator with AH-nold have been massively disappointing, and made the 'predator franchise' concept something of an artistic bad joke.  Not anymore - this one might the very best of the group, even compared with the original.  OK, some of the violence is a bit gruesome at times, but overall, they did a good job of making things exciting without making you feel like you wanted to puke and run out of the theater.  Fantastic acting and ending.  Even people who are not sci-fi fans might enjoy this one.

"Winter Warriors in Wool Socks!""Ski track on the Battlefield"" by V.A. Firsoff is one of the most detailed book on alpine and mountain operations that even  today has not been equaled. This book will appeal to the military and non-military reader as in a very easy narrative with a concise writing style. This book is also one of the first to be written on the military winter campaigns in Finland, Russia, Norway, the Alps and the Balkans, separating fact from fiction of these daring exploits. The book dissects material on equipment, tactics, techniques and procedures developed by various countries of the period. While there are technical details for the professional soldier, the material is also relevant to the civilian for historical understanding of living and fighting in this environment. This book is highly illustrated with period photography and diagrams.CONTENTS:-Preface-IllustrationsI. Skiing as it BeganII. Early Development of Military SkiingIII.

"Warriors and War WheelsPat Ware presents an excellent introduction to Special Operations capable vehicles in his work ""Special Forces Vehicles: 1940 to the Present Day"" from the ""Images of War"" series.  The book details the role of Special Forces and covers briefly a sampling of the predominate Special Forces units from around the world. Some of the countries covered are Russia, Israel, France, Britain, Germany, U.S., Australia, and others, coving historical vehicles and modern vehicles used in current conflicts like Afghanistan. The meat and potatoes of the book covers the anatomy of Special Forces vehicles and details on the particular vehicles employed by the units covered in chapter two. The focus of this book is predominately on wheeled vehicles from the Landrover and Jeeps to All-Terrain Vehicles and motorcycles to tactical dune buggies like the U.S. Fast Attack Vehicle (FAV). A lot of the pictures I have never seen before but many can be had on-line and/or are manufacture promotional photos. However this does not distract form the overall quality of the fine book. I highly recommend it to Special Forces historians with an interest in special forces mobility operations and interest in military vehicles or automotive history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OVUAVXGQR6Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848846428#wasThisHelpful","R1OVUAVXGQR6Z8","A8X2QG0FN70XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8X2QG0FN70XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOW I like this gem of a bathroom accessory. It stands a foot tall and blends right in well with any decor as it matches your stainless steel faucet unless you have gold ones. It comes as pictured with about 3 minutes of easy assembly.

"Large can of Nivea cream handy in the bathroom. Many may not know it but a lot of Germans use this cream on their babys for diaper rash. I discovered that fact when I lived in Germany for 6 years.  (Nivea is a German brand) I also use it after I use the bathroom to help with irritation especially in the summertime. Let's face it we women who wear pads  either for our periods or incontinence find we will get irrited in those areas and like me can develop a rash. Nivea cream helps me a lot to keep that irritation down to a minimum. If your life is a bit more sedentary as you have become older or you spend a lot of time sitting (i.e on the computer) your bottom will tend to become more sensitive -- the cream helps to relief that. Nivea cream in a can comes in all sizes. I also carry a small can in my purse for those times when I am out or traveling.

"When The Naked Face finally emerged from years of development hell at various studios in 1984 it was regarded as a major stinker, but with the passage of time it seems more of a mediocrity and another prime example of Cannon's sporadic attempts to go a bit upmarket with a decent cast and director and come up with considerably less than the sum of its parts. The last big-screen credit for writer-director Bryan Forbes, who'd gone from one of the most important figures in the post-war British film industry to being regarded as something of an outdated running joke by that time, it's a flat adaptation of a Sidney Sheldon thriller about an upmarket psychiatrist (Roger Moore) who suddenly finds himself the target of killer or killers unknown and regarded by the cop on the case (Rod Steiger, dialling it down but looking disarmingly like Ernie Wise) as the chief suspect in the murder of the various innocent parties who keep on getting killed instead of him. Naturally the motive is a secret he doesn't know but the script just hits plot points without making things especially interesting or providing much in the way of doubt or viable suspects while the direction never conjures up any atmosphere or thrills. Worse, it all ends with an Irving the Explainer finale where the killer jeopardises his chance to finally polish off the good doctor by spending ages pontificating allegorically and filling in plot details in horribly on the nose dialogue a world away from the naturalistic speech patterns that made Forbes' name in the British film industry a quarter of a century earlier.It doesn't help that parts of the film have that typical rather cheap look of so many Cannon films despite the star casting - Elliot Gould underplaying it as good cop to Steiger's bad cop, Art Carney as a down-at-heel ageing P.I. and Anne Archer among the patients. A better actor than even he gave himself credit for, Moore had delivered perhaps his best performance 14 years earlier in The Man Who Haunted Himself which was co-written by Forbes and you suspect he was hoping that lightning would strike twice, but here he's decent but far from outstanding in a part that almost certainly appealed because it's the antithesis of 007, barely able to throw a punch and having to call in the cavalry to save him rather than dealing with the killers himself. The kind of film that plays better on the small screen than it did on the big, it's the cinematic equivalent of wallpaper and all too understandable why this is one of the least remembered entries on his filmography.The German DVD and region-free Blu-ray offers a scrubbed up widescreen transfer with English and German soundtrack options, with US trailer and stills gallery as extras.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGFUQTJC8OS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8PPM00#wasThisHelpful","R2NGFUQTJC8OS6","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A curious Israelisation of Elmore Leonards 52 Pick-Up made only two years before the same producers made a more faithful and compelling adaptation with John Frankenheimer, The Ambassador is the kind of okay but resolutely undemanding political thriller that was starting to look more at home on the small screen than the big by 1984. Even the star cast - Robert Mitchum, Rock Hudson, Ellen Burstyn, Donald Pleasance, Fabio Testi - had started grazing on TV by then and was about a decade too late to draw much of a paying crowd at the movie theaters. After a disappointing US release, the Cannon group didn't even bother to release it in most of the foreign cinemas they owned despite planning it as a big prestige picture.Leonard's original plot was solid enough not to need any additional spins: a businessman is blackmailed over his affair, but rather than pay up he comes clean with his wife. None too pleased, the blackmailers murder his mistress and set him up for the crime, forcing him to set them against each other (shades of Leonard's 50s Western The Tall T) before they can drop him in it. In this version the hero is now the US Ambassador to Israel, it's his wife who's having the affair and the stakes are raised by the blackmail scheme coinciding with his attempts to get the Israelis and the PLO around the negotiating table. Yet turning a private scandal into a possible international incident actually lowers the tension - even though he tries to handle it quietly himself, Mitchum's character simply has too much power, too much access to money and too many resources to call on, which makes him less self-reliant and devious than Roy Scheider in 52 Pick-Up. It doesn't help that most of the heavy lifting is done by Hudson, surprisingly not looking too unhealthy in his final film, or that the villains are a poorly defined bunch who are never manipulated, merely caught.While J. Lee Thompson's film is not as appropriately seedy as Frankenheimer's later version, the old lech does manage to persuade Burstyn to let her puppies out of their kennel as the ambassador's wife with a taste for getting drunk at receptions and sleeping with Arab antique dealers-cum-PLO leaders, and there are enough explosions, helicopter shootouts and unconvincingly bloody massacres for the Go-Go boys to get a good exploitation movie trailer out of it despite its high political ideals (""He's through negotiating!""). But the cast are surprisingly good and generally avoid coasting even if they're not on top form, it's solidly made and, like co-producer Menachem Golan's earlier Operation Thunderbolt, more even-handed with the Arab characters than you'd expect even if the politics never stray beyond simplistic well-meaning ""give peace a chance"" platitudes. Unexceptional but watchable.The German DVD and region-free Blu-ray offers a cleaned up widescreen transfer with US trailer and stills gallery as extras.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FC6WH4MRP1FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X13W5W#wasThisHelpful","R2FC6WH4MRP1FN","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the introduction to one of his routines, Lenny Bruce expressed his hatred for the clichéd contrivances and sanctimoniousness of Hollywood message movies, but made one exception - Stanley Kramer and Mark Robson's Home of the Brave. Which seems particularly ironic today since in the intervening six-and-a-half decades the message has been handled much more impressively by other films and the film now seems at times ripe for parody in its naiveté and clumsiness: it's an undeniably important film, but it's often not a particularly good one. Arthur Laurents' original play dealt with anti-Semitism among front line soldiers, but with Crossfire changing its murdered homosexual into a murdered Jew two years earlier, screenwriter Carl Foreman opted to change the play's Jewish soldier who cracks up due to a toxic combination of what we now know as post-traumatic stress disorder and a lifetime of racist abuse into a black soldier instead. The change works well, but the film often doesn't: it does a reasonable job of hiding its very low budget (though the voices of the unseen Japanese soldiers taunting the G.I.s are laughably poor), but much of the dialogue is horribly on the nose (there's much talk of fried chicken and watermelon), the psychiatry diluted into layman's terms for a climactic miracle cure (though the film does at least threaten a relapse) and the optimistic ending feels awfully Hollywood.What does still work, Jeff Corey's idealist Dr Irving D. Explainer psychiatrist aside, are the performances, with James Edwards making the most of a rare substantial role for a black actor in the 1940s in the lead, avoiding the hamminess of some of his later performances by keeping his emotions and anger pent up for most of the picture, and Frank Lovejoy and Steve Brodie impressing as two of his companions on the fateful mission. While Lloyd Bridges thoroughly decent old college friend tries his best with an idealised role he seems too old for in the flashback scenes, the trio of Edwards, Lovejoy and Brodie have more shades of grey to work with, and it's their frayed interaction that keeps the film compelling even when Dimitri Tiomkin's overblown score is cranking up the volume and hitting you over the head as the choir tries to impress you with the monumental importance of it all. Of course, you have to bear in mind that in the still-segregated 1949 this was daring taboo-busting stuff, especially when so many black actors were still reduced to playing shuffling racial stereotypes for cheap laughs if they wanted to work (something the film does touch upon), but seen today it's more historically important and influential than dramatically convincing.Olive's Region A-locked Blu-ray release has come in for some criticism because of the master material used, which has its fair share of scratches and contrast problems in a couple of shots, but as an extremely low budget independent production made under the radar this is a film that probably never looked that great even when new. But within the limitations of changed ownership, poor storage and no budget for a full restoration it's a respectable transfer of a print that few would complain about if they saw it projected at a revival house. As usual with Olive releases there are no extras, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D1JZC1JHLMK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQAUO3O#wasThisHelpful","R2D1JZC1JHLMK1","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last of the collaborations between James Stewart and director Anthony Mann, The Man From Laramie is the most ambitious even if it isn't always completely successful. On one level it's a standard revenge Western, with Stewart looking for the gunrunners who caused his brother's death, but his hunt takes in rancher Donald Crisp's powerful but dysfunctional dynasty and its divisions as well, and its through them that the film moves into almost mythically tragic territory. With foreman and almost adopted son Arthur Kennedy devotedly but thanklessly running the ranch for him and constantly trying to protect the old man from the feckless stupidity and sadism of his natural son Alex Nicol it soon becomes clear that not all the bad guys are that bad. Indeed, everything Kennedy does wrong is done out of the best motives that are constantly thwarted, turning what could easily have been a stereotypical villain into a genuinely tragic figure as he realises the man he regards as a second father sees him only as a mere employee (interestingly, James Gray used this same character arc for Joaquin Phoenix's character in The Yards). Even Crisp's autocrat is tormented by recurring dreams of a stranger riding in to destroy his family as he slowly goes blind, believing Stewart to be a virtual horseman of the apocalypse.Along with the tormented and frustrated characters it's also surprisingly violent for its day. While it wasn't unusual for Stewart's characters to carry their own stigmata in Mann's Westerns (in Bend of the River he even hides a scar on his neck from a botched lynching), here he really suffers as he's beaten up, dragged across salt flats and through a fire and then shot in the hand in one scene alone, all of which only serves to fuel his hatred more until the affable character we met at the film's beginning has become a distant memory. In many ways it reverses the usual journey Mann put Stewart through in their Westerns: rather than going from bitterness to reluctant hero, here he starts out `nice to everybody' (as the very out-of-keeping title song puts it) to end the film all but consumed by rage.As usual, there's admirable economy in the writing - there's a lot of plot and several key characters but it manages bring them all over and incorporate an almost mystical sense of tragic destiny without seeming rushed or contrived, offering a satisfying Western with some substance. . It's also the closest Mann ever got to his long cherished Western version of King Lear that he was finally preparing when he died during the shooting of A Dandy in Aspic. The only one of the Mann-Stewart films together to be shot in Scope, Mann uses it superbly, and not just in the mountain location shots. Check out the beautiful establishing shot of the town on Sunday evening, the Mexicans and Indians heading for church on one side of the frame while on the other the white townsfolk drink and gamble.Thankfully that's preserved in Twilight Time's limited edition region-free Blu-ray, which improves immensely on the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD release thanks to a beautiful new 4K scan from the original negative in its original 2.55:1 ratio, ensuring the film hasn't looked this good since it it cinema screens in 1955. as you might expect from a 50s film, extras are limited but still an improvement on the DVD release - isolated music and effects track, teaser trailer and full trailer (which was panned and scanned on Sony's DVD but which is remastered in widescreen here) and a booklet with liner notes by Julie Kirgo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8SJRFB14F6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVRIVMG#wasThisHelpful","R2O8SJRFB14F6M","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Two Rode Together, John Ford revisited the same true story that inspired The Searchers, and with many of the same supporting cast - Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, John Qualen by yimminey and Henry Brandon, who played Scar in the earlier film and this time gets to play the Comanche chief he was based on, Quanah Parker. It even boasts the same screenwriter, Frank Nugent, but if anything it's a far bleaker film that offers little hope and takes a dim view of almost every character in the film. Perhaps that's one of the reasons it has such a low reputation in the Ford canon, spurred on by Ford's assessment that the film was ""the worst piece of crap I've done in twenty years"" (he made the film during one of his frequent deep depressions, allegedly purely for the money), but along with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance it's one of his best late films.The plot certainly has similarities to Ethan Edwards' quest, though this takes place over a period of weeks rather than years. James Stewart's small town sheriff is reluctantly shanghaied by John McIntire's cavalry officer into trading with Quanah Parker for any white captives he may still have after their distraught families turn up en masse demanding the army take action, with Richard Widmark's old army friend ordered to desert and accompany him to make sure he goes through with it. Stewart may be given an introduction deliberately reminiscent of Henry Fonda in My Darling Clementine, but it soon becomes clear that behind the bonhomie there's a very dark individual. But rather than racism, he's driven by avarice: the kind of lawman who buys votes with free beer and never saw anything he didn't want a 10% cut of, he's the kind of deliverer who's all too eager to squeeze every dollar out of the distraught fathers and agree to pass off the first white seventeen year old he can find as one long lost son. He's a mean drunk with a particularly venal temper that makes it brutally clear what the families can expect if he finds the hostages - that they'll be no better than animals who'll happily rape their own sisters and then sell them ""for a good knife or a bad rifle"" - and what's worse, the shockingly pitiless finale shows he's right. Some are too ashamed to return or even let their families know they're alive, others can't remember a life before they were taken and fight tooth and claw to stay behind even though to their own chief they're worth less than a few rifles.As Julie Kirgo points out in her excellent liner notes in the Blu-ray, it's not just the hostages who have suffered, the film detailing the way their families have changed for the worst, some driven mad, others gone bad while Shirley Jones' character is so guilt stricken about not protecting her younger brother that she dresses like a boy as if to fill his place. Worse, the very people so desperate to retrieve their lost children turn on them when they see what the intervening years living as Comanches has made of them - the fate of one of them is particularly brutal when the Ford stock company turn into something more at home in Ox-Bow. Nor are they any more sympathetic to one who tries to make the readjustment, either shunning Linda Cristal's 'squaw' or pruriently asking for details of just what she did with her Comanche husband. While there's something approaching redemption in the ending, it's a begrudgingly reluctant enough kind to have almost come from an Anthony Mann film, the closest thing to a happy ending being trying to run away further than the lascivious stories have travelled.Stewart's on good form and so is Widmark, who's game enough to just about pull off his romantic subplot despite being obviously far too old for his character. Ford's direction is unfussy but it's still a good looking film even though he's a long way from his Monument Valley stamping grounds courtesy of Charles Lawton's strong cinematography that's well represented on Twilight Time's beautifully remastered region-free Blu-ray. George Duning's excellent albeit largely monothematic score also gets its own isolated track on the disc (aside from the aforementioned booklet, the only other extra is the original trailer, which begins, like so many Western trailers of its day, with a crack at TV Westerns).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6ITL9GFCFJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMIN82C#wasThisHelpful","RD6ITL9GFCFJE","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""If this house is good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, it's good enough for us!""Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation is a superior example of that all-but forgotten genre: the family comedy - a film both aimed at the whole family but also taking aim at the whole notion of family togetherness, even if it's not loaded for bear. Easing into the grandpa stage of his career, James Stewart is the centre of the storm, the grumpy family man who finds his wife (Maureen O'Hara) has taken a house on the coast with the idea of not only taking their two youngest children with them but also their two married daughters and their husbands. Naturally it's a recipe for disaster - the house looks like Norman Bates was renting rooms and nobody's bothered to clean it since he went away to that nice hospital, the Heath Robinson-style generator becomes Stewart's mortal enemy, his youngest daughter (Lauri Peters) won't leave the house because she's too embarrassed about her braces and his youngest son (Michael Burns) takes the TV on vacation with him so he doesn't have to see the family, one of the grandchildren hates Stewart so much he throws things at him whenever he sees him, one husband (Josh Peine) storms off after a row while the other (John Saxon's smug professor) takes an interest in Valerie Varda's glamorous neighbor, Reginald Gardiner's yacht club bigwig takes a shine to O'Hara and they find themselves having to accommodate Peine's prospective employer, the puritanically uninteresting bird-watching teetotaller John McGiver and his wife Marie Wilson as well... the usual family holiday nightmares that make the grownups count the days until they can get back to the safety of work.Naturally everything eventually works out just as you expect it will, even if Stewart has to tell a few lies or bribe Fabian to date Peters, but there's a lot of fun to be had along the way. Like most vacations, it takes its time to get into the swing of things, and it's more an accumulation of gentle smiles and good humour than belly laughs, at least until McGiver memorably teaches Stewart the fundamentals of birdwatching in the film's funniest setpiece. But it's as sincerely likeable as many of Stewart's frustrations are all too recognisable from real life, keeping things for the most part focussed on sweating the small stuff to the maximum effect. It's well crafted by old studio hands like screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and director Henry Koster (who worked with Stewart on Harvey), with an easygoing score by Henry Mancini that initially takes its cue from Alain Roman's memorable theme for M. Hulot's Vacances before going off on its own direction.Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray offers an excellent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with an isolated score track, trailer, Movietone Newsreel extract from a rather desperate publicity stunt and a booklet with notes by Julie Kirgo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62SDKKEFP34A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6IQKDC#wasThisHelpful","R62SDKKEFP34A","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite starring Bing Crosby towards the end of his days as a leading man, High Time is one of the most forgotten of Blake Edwards’ comedies, and it’s not too surprising. It’s a thin comedy built around a simple idea – Bing’s millionaire businessman decides to go to college alongside Fabian, Richard Beymer and Tuesday Weld – that it never really does that much with. In fact, it’s almost plotless, a string of brief scenes, few of which ever develop into full blown comic setpieces and which do little more than show the passage of time from one year to the next. There’s little in the way of character development or even character scenes, with montage the preferred approach and longer scenes surprisingly few and far between: a Confederate ball with Bing’s new pledge in drag for an initiation dare, scavenging wood for a bonfire (a sequence that shows Edwards’ love of silent sight gags) and a scene where Bing ill-advisedly takes his roomies out to eat at one of his restaurants the most memorable. But generally none of the cast have much to do and nothing much happens until the writers decide to throw in a few unconvincing romantic complications with French teacher Nicole Maurey in the last third and add a few songs (The Second Time Around for Bing and The Foggy Foggy Dew for Fabian) to keep the fans happy.As Julie Kirgo’s liner notes in Twilight Time’s limited edition Blu-ray note, it’s the kind of determinedly innocent depiction of teenagers and varsity life that was already out of date in 1960, but with the passing of another five decades its very old-fashionedness gives it a nave cosiness that’s hard to hold against it. The film’s only real ingenuity is reserved for a series of delightful and consistently imaginative scene transitions as scenes are frozen and painted over to make way for new ones, leaves blow away, snow is swept away or captions rolled up like a carpet to reveal the next scene to the accompaniment of Henry Mancini’s jaunty score. Sadly even these become more conventional as the film hits the home stretch and it does perhaps feel like Edwards was trying to give the film some personality that wasn’t in the script (reworked from a Gary Cooper project when his illness caused him to drop out of the film), but while it never amounts to much, the film is a pleasant enough diversion.Twilight Time’s Blu-ray offers a very decent widescreen transfer in the original CinemaScope ratio with extras limited to isolated score, booklet and trailer, the latter featuring a fair amount of deleted footage including a number by Fabian that didn’t make the final cut of the film (there’s also another number listed in the credits that doesn’t appear in the film).","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NE4WA8IND8VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090V4IPI#wasThisHelpful","R2NE4WA8IND8VD","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe there was ever a time when Woody Allen and Mia Farrow brought out the best in each other, but in their run of 80s films they did just that, with Farrow showing a range she'd never demonstrated before and Allen rejuvenated by the collaboration. The bittersweet Broadway Danny Rose is one of their best - not up to the heights of the remarkable Purple Rose of Cairo but with the same sense of thwarted romanticism as Allen's luckless but devoted low-rent talent agent whose roster includes one-legged tap dancers, rabbi-impersonating penguins and pigeons who play the piano finally gets a client a shot at a big comeback with inevitably tragic (for him) results. The act in question is Nick Apollo Forte's heavy-maintenance one-hit wonder singer, who Allen manages to wrangle a gig at the Waldorf and the possibility of a spot on a Milton Berle show - but he's so nervous he'll only perform if his girlfriend (Farrow) is there, and since he's married that means Allen has to act as his beard. Which turns out to be a particularly dangerous favour when she decides to break the news to her mobster ex-boyfriend that she's leaving him for another man...Like all mismatched couple movies, it depends both on the stars' chemistry (still intact in 1984) and creating a credible pair of polar opposites. After spending most of her career playing waifs who'd probably blow away in a light wind, Farrow is a revelation as the ramrod straight tough talking gangster's widow whose philosophy of life sounds like the screenplay for Murder Incorporated and who looks almost indestructible even when threatened by baseball bat wielding goombahs. And she's matched by Allen in what may be his best performance, a surprisingly layered turn that doesn't spend too long in his usual comfort zones and seems drawn from the hundreds of fast-talking but luckless low-rent borscht belt agents whose paths he must have crossed. Even as the pair are pursued by hitmen through a warehouse of Macey's Thanksgiving Day Parade floats or encountering a stray superhero in the flatlands (a scene that could have come straight out of an early 50s Fellini film), they're entirely convincing despite not living in the same world as the rest of us.Shot in an almost neo-realist style complete with black and white photography that could have come straight out of an Italian film of the early 50s, it has a look that's almost suspended in time and place despite the 80s New York setting. Which is entirely appropriate, since it's as much a valentine to a vanished style of filmmaking as it is to a vanishing breed of showbusiness, and a thoroughly charming one that gets the mix of laughs and heartbreak just right - my hand to God.As you might expect from a Woody Allen film, Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray is light on extras - just a brief trailer, booklet and isolated score track for Dick Hyman's hugely enjoyable arrangements of various Italian standards that propel the film along.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VDFJ2N8WSG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6IKUL0#wasThisHelpful","R15VDFJ2N8WSG6","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You women give me a pain! All you want is money!""""Yeh - well what else have you got?""Before Bob Fosse and Ginger Rogers, the story of Twenties Flapper Roxie Hart discovering that the right mixture of scandal and piety could not only sell enough newspapers to turn her into a national heroine but also let her get away with murder was a hit Broadway play that had all the ingredients Cecil B. De Mille was looking for in his silent movie days. But with De Mille coming off the hugely successful The King of Kings (The Criterion Collection), he was persuaded that being associated with a comedy as scandalous an irreverent as 1927's Chicago while his distinctly reverent life of Christ was still packing them in across the world wasn't deemed appropriate, so the film was credited instead to his regular assistant director Frank Urson (who directed part of the film at the beginning of the shoot before being demoted within a week), with De Mille retaining a `supervised by' credit.It's certainly not a film to be ashamed of, a rollicking have-your-cake-and-eat-it condemnation of crime as entertainment that at once mocks the way the media promote a killer as a victim while joyfully revelling in the absurdity and hypocrisy of (almost) all concerned in a way that feeds on that same vicarious thrill for a good juicy scandal whether it's true or not that it condemns in press and public alike. It's a hypocrisy that the play's author Maurine Watkins was only too aware of, having spiced up her reporting of the two sensational real-life murder trials the play was based on to boost her career, something she played down when the show opened: indeed, it's widely assumed that the reason she refused to sell the story's rights to be turned into a musical during her lifetime was guilt because her light-hearted articles helped two killers avoid justice.Roxie's husband (Victor Varconi) may dote on her and even turn to crime to fund her defence - even if he is robbing the crooked shyster he's employing to meet his exorbitant fee - but Phyllis Haver's Roxie is the kind of slutty wife who spends other people's money like it was going out of fashion and then shoots them when they call it a day. In this case it's Eugene Pallette's unlikely Lothario who takes the bullet. From then on, everyone's out for what they can get, from the cops who treat it as an opportunity to get their picture in the papers, the prosecutor who sees a chance to make it to the D.A.'s office and Robert Edeson (""Cut the bull - I'm not your husband, I'm your lawyer."") as the kind of mouthpiece-cum-PR man who doesn't actually break the law but sure does put a crimp in it and who doesn't use a safe because so many of his clients are safecrackers. But towering over them all is the self-centred Roxie, who revels in her celebrity and whose early worries about going down the river evaporate as she realises she's far too appealing to men for that to ever happen. But, like glory, all notoriety is fleeting...You do wonder if the rather stodgy final scenes were quite so puritanical in the original play after all the gleeful amorality that precedes it, but they're a small price to pay for such a joyously cynical comedy. And in De Mille in the days when comedies of sexual manners were his forte rather than religious epics it has the perfect director. He overcomes the lack of sound by filling a talky play with great bits of visual comedy - he's especially good at throwaway observations like the trio of gum chewing flappers reacting to every new development in court while the jury watch Roxie's legs. He's good at other bits of business too, be it the cuckolded husband picking up Roxie's carelessly discarded clothes around their separate beds or the striking use of a shattered mirror in the murder scene. And he draws memorable turns from even the smallest supporting characters, like May Robson's matron (""This is a decent jail - you can't act here the way you do at home!"") and the other publicity hungry gals on Murderess's Row. Most of all, it's great fun.Thankfully, after years of obscurity it's received excellent treatment on DVD. Flicker Alley's release, taken from De Mille's personal print, is a truly beautiful transfer, and there's a good extras package too. The best is also the shortest, a featurette on the real trials based on trial transcripts and Watkins' articles that shows that little exaggeration was required in the play. Along with stills galleries from the original Broadway production, there are also reproductions of the original articles and an excellent booklet in newspaper format.The second disc includes a 63-minute feature documentary from 1950, The Golden Twenties, compiled by the March of Time newsreel team looking back on the major events and personalities of the time, from wing walkers, vaudeville and dance marathons to the Red Scare, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Boston Police strike and Prohibition. It's more of a whistle stop tour than a detailed analysis as you might guess from the awkward framing advice where a youngster asks a librarian for advice on what to write a history report about, but despite being released by RKO at the height of Howard Hughes' anti-communist hysteria it avoids turning it into a propaganda piece and largely stays politically and historically neutral. Accompanying 30-minute documentary The Flapper story uses some of the same footage (in at least one instance out of context when it misidentifies Lillian Russell as an anonymous suffragette), but attempts a more in-depth look at the changes in women's place in society through interviews with women who lived through the decade. Unfortunately, while it does show that the political rebellion the suffragettes wanted largely turned into the first generation of women to grow up with the vote choosing to scandalise their parents by having a good time and doing what they wanted rather than what they were expected, it's a bit on the superficial side.All in all an excellent presentation for a long lost classic that's a lot of wicked fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39I0JAYS3MNFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N0E5DW#wasThisHelpful","R39I0JAYS3MNFI","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1926 version of The Late Mathias Pascal is a long film - for some a bit too long (the 1937 remake takes little more than half as long) - yet it manages to fill its near-three hour running time with such a surfeit of riches that it never outstays its very warm welcome. Based on a Pirandello novel that bears some similarities to H.G. Wells The History of Mr Polly (though it was published six years earlier), its tale of an underachieving unambitious young man's journey from one life to another constantly shifts mood, genre and style in a manner that could have been disastrous in lesser hands, but director Michel L'Herbier and star Ivan Mozzhukin turn it into a triumph that's crying out for rediscovery - not least because it's as entertaining as it is ambitious.Mathias Pascal starts the film as an intellectual dreamer too lost in his books to even notice that his widowed mother and he are cheated out of their home and inheritance, and barely even notices that the girl his best friend (a very, very young and beardless Michel Simon, who looks if anything even more, er, unique than in his talkies) adores is actually infatuated with him. He has so little control over his own destiny or awareness of his surroundings that when Simon ill-advisedly persuades him to propose to her on his behalf he barely even notices that she misunderstands his intentions and she's literally dancing him from engagement to marriage to unhappy life with the mother-in-law from Hell in tow, with only the prospect of worse to come as he sees his once eager bride turning into her mother before his eyes. Nor is his professional life any more exciting, finding himself the assistant librarian in a rat-infested library filled with tottery piles of dusty books scattered around like the debris from a bomb. He even loses the only joy in his life, his child, and wanders off in a daze...Having sleepwalked through his first life, he stumbles into his next almost accidentally, finding himself in Monte Carlo on a whim, winning a fortune and, through a twist of fate, being widely assumed to have committed suicide when the body of night's biggest loser is mistaken for his. With no particular plan in mind he finds himself in Rome under a clumsily assumed identity, but finds that dying and being reborn has its complications in a world where bureaucracy prevents him from registering at a hotel or opening a bank account. But it also offers him a chance at love and happiness if he can avoid obstacles like being blackmailed by the object of his affections' fiancé - though that might mean dying and being born yet again...The film is not without its faults. The resolution of Mathias' return to his hometown in particular is something of a very awkward tightrope act that sporadically threatens to send the film crashing to earth with a thud before regaining its balance, while we never learn quite how Mathias resolves his official identity crisis. But when a film gets as much right as this it's hard not to forgive its shortcomings.At times it's like a sumptuous five course banquet or an all you can eat buffet at the best (and most enjoyable) restaurant in town with the widest possible menu. L'Herbier never limits himself to one genre or style, yet the changes in mood and approach never feel disjointed but perfectly logical in a way that never breaks the film's flow even as it constantly delights and surprises you. L'Herbier wasn't a man of few images (his 1928 film L'Argent was even longer by 25 minutes), but he seems to delight in constantly finding new ways to approach his material. He occasionally has fun with cinematic conventions - a fade to iris suddenly stops as Mathias comes up with an idea, a slow motion murder fantasy followed by rapid appearance and departure of the police - and throws in flights of fancy, but still manages to invest the more dramatic moments with real pain and emotion, never losing sight of the darker implications of the underlying themes of loss of freedom and identity, and is blessed with a leading man who is if anything even more remarkably adept at the many shifts in tone.The largely forgotten (at least in the west) Ivan Mozzhukin, is quite extraordinary as the man who isn't what he once was, at once a combination of the best of many actors - John Barrymore in his prime, Ealing era Alec Guinness, Stan Laurel, moments of Bela Lugosi (who seems to have borrowed some of his mannerisms for Dracula) - which is entirely appropriate for a tale of shifting identities, yet at the same time has his own unique presence. He can do comedy with the understated grace of a Chaplin or a Keaton, yet when tragedy strikes convinces equally in scenes of intense emotional drama where he's fighting not to express emotion rather than going overboard. A huge star in Russia before the revolution and if anything an even bigger one in France afterwards before an ill-judged trip to Hollywood, where his name was changed to John Moskin and his expressive face altered by a studio-mandated nose job before Universal ditched him with the advent of talkies, Mozzhukin could be described as the textbook great actor: his work was actually studied in acting classes. His versatility makes him the ideal lead not just for a protagonist but for a film that so deftly changes its character as circumstances demand. It's the kind of performance that makes you want to seek out more of his work.It's a handsomely mounted production as well (the sets co-designed by Alberto Cavalcanti, who would go on to be one of Ealing's greatest directors with the likes of Dead of Night) and thankfully Flicker Alley's excellent Blu-ray offers a fine presentation. The print used was taken from the now-lost original negative, and either negative or print had suffered some wear by then: there are scratches, one brief bit of water damage and a few slight racking problems, but there's nothing that silent film aficionados won't take in their stride, and the film is both uncut and boasts good definition and detail. It's also blessed with an extraordinarily good score by Timothy Brock that's one of the finest I've heard in a long time, and easily one of the best modern scores for a silent. Brock has a sense of humour without Mickey Mousing the jokes, and he ingeniously adapts and develops his themes as Mathias evolves from one identity to the next. It's the perfect compliment to an often exhilarating film.The only extra is a booklet, but the film packs so much into its 171-minute running time that you won't feel that you haven't got your money's worth. Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M25JT3NB14VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA3MHLM#wasThisHelpful","R1M25JT3NB14VS","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1926 swashbuckling romance Bardelys the Magnificent should by all rights be a lost film: as part of their deal with author Rafael Sabatini, MGM promised to destroy all existing prints and the negative if they didn't renew the rights, which they didn't, talkies having made silent films worthless by 1936 when they came up for renewal. By luck one surviving incomplete print was found, and is surprisingly good condition despite missing one key reel. It certainly would have been a crime had the film been lost forever - it may not be a masterpiece, but it is a hugely enjoyable audience picture with the studio going all-out to capitalise on John Gilbert's huge success in The Big Parade with an epic swashbuckler that's part John Barrymore's Don Juan and part Douglas Fairbanks Musketeer movie. While Gilbert may not be as good an actor as Barrymore or as good a fencer as Fairbanks, he's certainly every inch the dashingly amoral hero, whether waxing lyrical courtesy of some witty title cards or duelling with a cuckolded husband over a woman he's already tired of (""Strange these men never notice their wives until I take a fancy to them."").Gilbert is Bardelys, the greatest lover in all of France, locks of whose hair are so in demand by all the best ladies in the court that he has to employ servants to cut and be-ribbon them from wigs to ensure a steady supply without going bald. Naturally this makes him extremely unpopular with husbands and rivals, and he finds himself tricked by Roy D'Arcy's second best lover in all of France into a bet that he can't marry Eleanor Boardman's virtuous Roxalanne, which he manages thanks to a little deception only to find himself genuinely falling in love with her and swearing off his love `em and leave `em ways. Naturally redemption is not far away, but not before she turns on him (only moments after swearing eternal devotion) and he finds himself in the condemned cell thanks to the duplicitous D'Arcy's dastardliness. All of which is hugely enjoyable and staged with some panache and a lot of humour by director King Vidor.Both Vidor and Gilbert were somewhat disappointed with the result, though after producing the biggest hit of the decade and one of its most powerful films with The Big Parade anything else would have seemed an anticlimax, especially a film that aims purely to please the crowds. But while Bardelys may not have been as magnificent as its director and star might have wanted, as the King (future director Arthur Lubin) says, he's never dull. Gilbert is noticeably doubled in many of the stunts, though he still clearly does a fair number himself, including swinging a hundred feet in the air above a crowd of onlookers (the terror on his face is certainly real enough) in a splendid escape from the gallows setpieces as he uses pikes as slides and scaling ladders that goes all out to out-Fairbanks Fairbanks.The missing section of the film has been recreated with stills and a brief extract taken from the trailer (curiously the trailer itself has not been included on Flicker Alley's DVD release), though there's still one unanswered question that the lost footage may have explained - just why does Bardelys masquerade as a wanted traitor even before he finds out Boardman's father is one of his co-conspirators? Other than that headscratcher it's a fine presentation, especially considering how close the film came to being lost forever.Compared to the splendid main feature on Flicker Alley's DVD, 1922's Monte Cristo certainly suffers: neither the film nor the restoration are in the same league. Taken on its own merits, however, once you get past the first couple of reels it develops into easily one of the best screen adaptations of Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. Most film versions spend so long on the set-up that they end up short changing Edmond Dantes' elaborate revenge on the three men who falsely betrayed him to 14 years imprisonment in the notorious Chateau D'if, but while the 107-minute running time, though generous by the standards of its day, doesn't allow the kind of labyrinthine twists and turns that to date only the excellent Gerard Depardieu mini-series had the screentime to deliver, it does give the film plenty of room to uncover the skeletons in their closets and lead to their downfall - as well as throwing in a rather good swordfight in a courtroom as well.Gilbert was unsatisfied with his performance, but he is terrific in his various roles and guises. While the young Edmond Dantes is somewhat on the bland side once the star's good looks are hidden behind his long prisoner's beard, his latter disguises as a one-eyed priest and his reinvention as the Count of Monte Cristo - looking for all the world like Boris Karloff's brother with the weight of the world on his shoulders - he's particularly impressive. Like the key supporting players he's aged convincingly and looks different enough to pass unrecognised among people who knew him well as a young man without the audience thinking ""Come on, you MUST recognise him"" the way so many later versions do. The supporting cast are also on good form, director Emmett J. Flynn using close-ups to keep the performances more subtle in key moments than you might expect, and there's an early appearance from Gilbert's The Big Parade leading lady Rénée Adorée in a small role.Sadly the film has not survived in as good condition as Bardelys: only a single Czechoslovakian print in poor condition survived, and it looks like the restoration work was carried out on video. There are few breaks in the film but there is a lack of fine detail, though certainly nothing as bad as the average washed out and duped-to-death $5 public domain DVDs of many vintage films, so you do have to make allowances while watching it. However, since only one other film that Gilbert made for Fox, 1923's Cameo Kirby, is known to still exist it's difficult to complain: between a compromised copy of the film and no copy of the film, it's clearly the preferable option. And like it's DVD stable mate, it would be a tragedy if there were no way of seeing it at all.Flicker Alley round out their package with some very decent extras: an audio commentary by Jeffrey Vance and Tony Maletta and two alternate scores on Bardelys, a half-hour documentary Rediscovering John Gilbert with Gilbert's daughter, Leatrice Gilbert Fountain dispelling many of the myths about her father, a copy of Gilbert's contract with Fox, stills galleries for both films and a particularly good booklet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NPFBVDYXT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BVN3BO#wasThisHelpful","R8NPFBVDYXT2","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""One must sorrow that a man of such genius should be a drunken clown.""Kino's useful boxed set brings together four of their silent John Barrymore releases that show the star at the peak of his powers, albeit to varying effect.1928 silent Tempest may not be a great picture but it is a great star vehicle for a star in his prime before drink and self-parody took their toll on his reputation. In fact, it's richly ironic that in one of those art-predicting-life moments it's drink and a scandal involving a woman's honor that causes John Barrymore's peasant-made-officer's downfall in this lavish romance set in the period before and during the Russian Revolution. If you're only familiar with the Barrymore of later years, this is a revelation, the Great Profile seen at his best, with a gravitas and intensity that he wears lightly, devilishly good looking and confident but not arrogant with it. The perfect movie hero, it's easy to see why he was such a major influence on the young Errol Flynn. Indeed, in one sequence on a horse in a river you could almost be looking at Flynn in his prime.The film itself is romantic hokum, but executed with real conviction and produced on a lavish scale. Barrymore's a peasant cavalryman from the wrong side of the Urals, no socialist or red but no fan of the aristocracy either, who manages to become the first commissioned officer to rise from the ranks in a decade thanks to George Fawcett's paternalistic general only to lose his rank and his honor thanks to an unfortunate but innocent indiscretion with the general's daughter (Camilla Horn) who publicly loathes him so much you know it must be love. Throughout he's shadowed by Boris de Fast's strikingly spectral Bolshevik peddler who acts like a nagging devil on his shoulder as his disillusionment is fuelled and he ultimately finds his niche deciding who's going to be lined up against the wall after the Revolution. Naturally redemption and true love will enter into it, but not before the filmmakers have expressed their dismay with both sides - the aristocrats, exemplified by Ulrich Haupt's von Stroheim-lite villain (Erich von Stroheim was an uncredited writer on the picture) who stubs his cigarettes out on lowly NCO Louis Wolheim's neck and then berates him for ruining a perfectly good cigarette, and the Bolsheviks who respond with even greater cruelty in the vivid conveyer-belt-like execution scenes. The only chance the hero and heroine have for a happy ending in this kind of world is to escape their own country and leave it forever, a situation that would have struck home with the many White Russian exiles in Hollywood at the time.The film's ably directed by Sam Taylor (with uncredited scenes by Lewis Milestone and Viktor Tourjansky) with a strong and imaginative eye for composition - there's a particularly striking execution scene played in the time it takes to open and close a door, and Charles Rosher's superb camerawork and William Cameron Menzies' production work together to good effect even in the occasionally worn surviving prints, the film opening with a lavish tracking shot around a model of a garrison town before melding it almost flawlessly to a real set in a single camera movement. The ballroom sequence is particularly outstanding, with the socially ostracised Barrymore entering the brightly lit ball silhouetted in the foreground and later drunkenly watching his `betters' while their dancing reflections can be seen in the silverware in front of him. And when he finds himself facing years in solitary confinement, the walls of his cell become a giant movie screen on which he can see images of his comrades fighting at the front and the woman he loves laughing at him as he goes mad. They may not make them like this any more, but thankfully while prints still survive we can at least still see those they did.Kino's DVD has no extras but boasts a fine transfer.It's hard to disagree with Orson Welles, who idolised John Barrymore, that the great man is not at his best in The Beloved Rogue, but the film has so much else going for it than the lead performance that it works surprisingly well despite his going down with a particularly virulent strain of drunken Douglas Fairbanksitis. As Francois Villon, the 15th century French poet and rogue caught between the machinations of the beleaguered and devious king and the ruthlessly ambitious and devious Duke of Burgundy, he's clearly making a grab not just for the people's crown as King of the Fools but Fairbanks crown as King of the Swashbucklers, sliding from rooftop to rooftop, climbing and jumping from castles, springing over city walls through bedroom windows from catapults and also, unfortunately, hamming, overacting and prancing around as if Paris was the Yellow Brick Road and he was off to see the Wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz...It's a shame, because it's the best role Errol Flynn never played (and one that Ronald Colman did, in If I Were King, as did several others from Yul Brynner on TV to Oreste in the forgotten MGM musical The Vagabond King) and had his Don Juan director Alan Crosland been able to reign him in, one that Barrymore had the ability to play much better. But Barrymore just seems content to play to the gallery, act the drunken fool and thumb his nose at the supporting players when he was capable of so much more at that time in his career - he gets the balance between swashbuckling, comedy and romantic dignity right in Don Juan, but this seems to owe more to bottled spirits than high spirits, sending up his own Hell-raising image at the expense of the part and, at times, the film.The supporting cast are more successful, among them Conrad Veidt doing a Lon Chaney twisted and superstitious King Louis the Little, Marceline Day making a little bit more of the romantic interest than is in the script and future Freaks co-stars Henry Victor and Angelo Rossitto (and yes, there is gratuitous dwarf kicking involved), while the filmmakers get great comic mileage out of Dick Sutherland's remarkable features as the executioner Tritran L'Hermite. Yet despite Paul Bern's script replacing Villon's own poetry with simple doggerel and never quite showing enough wit and invention for a hero who survived dangerous times through wit and invention, the film still manages you to carry you along without feeling cheated (though the ending is a bit underwhelming) and, thanks to Joseph August's cinematography and William Cameron Menzies' production design, the film certainly looks a treat: the King of Fools sequence may make ample use of Universal's full-scale Hunchback of Notre Dame sets, but Menzies puts his stamp on the film in the snow swept side streets of a city in the midst of winter that gives it a feeling part vivid storybook, part reality that's where the film's real poetry is to be found.Kino's Region 1 NTSC DVD offers an acceptable print with the only extra a brief and cursory introduction by Orson Welles filmed for a TV screening and which is in far worse condition than the film itself!Despite being one of his signature screen roles, John Barrymore's hugely successful 1920 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's oft-filmed tale is far from the definitive one - for that you'd have to see the 1931 Rouben Mamoulian-Frederic March film, which is still striking today. Despite a few moments of censor-baiting child cruelty and sexual exploitation, it's a rather flat adaptation, with Barrymore the main attraction. His Jekyll may be a bit of a milquetoast, but the ham in him knows that Hyde is the real meat-and-potatoes for an actor, and he devours it readily, showcasing his own remarkable makeup-free initial transformation achieved with little more than some expressive scrunching of his own features and some subtle lighting that is extraordinarily successful (later shots of him fully transformed did take advantage of some monster makeup, however). It's a party trick Barrymore repeated, perhaps even more successfully, in a scene in his later Don Juan, but where that had a great film built around it, here the transformations at times feel too much like the whole show. And it's certainly worth the price of a ticket at least once, even if the film itself is distinctly average even for its day.As one of the most popular Public Domain titles on the DVD market, there's no shortage of truly terrible transfers - most poor prints, often running at the wrong speed, sometimes incomplete and often with hideous and irrelevant scores - so it's worth noting that Kino's Region 1 NTSC DVD release is probably the best version we'll ever get. Aside from a good print at the right speed, it also comes with copious and always relevant extras - an extract from the rival and much cheaper 1920 Sheldon Lewis version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde that was offered to exhibitors who couldn't afford the more expensive Barrymore version, an early Stan Laurel short film Dr Pyckle and Mr Pride, detailed production notes that are far from the usual PR fluff you get on DVDs as well as a rare 1909 audio recording of a particularly hammy stage version of `The Transformation Scene.' It may cost a bit more, but it's worth it.Movies have been taking liberties with Conan Doyle's creation long before Guy Ritchie, with the Great Profile's 1922 silent take on the Great Detective, Sherlock Holmes (aka Moriarty), a modern-day version ill-advisedly rewriting the book in a manner that offended the purists while not coming up with anything new to appeal to the more casual moviegoer, then or now. Partially shot on location in London and opening with some striking overhead shots of the city, it's not as terrible as its reputation nor as good as it should be considering all the talent and money involved (Reginald Denny, Louis Wolheim and future gossip queen Hedda Hopper are in it as well). Revolving around a blackmail attempt and some love letters to a European Prince from the woman who killed herself when they were prevented from marrying, it's at times a talky script, always a problem in a silent film, with more of a taste for melodrama than sleuthing.A very loose adaptation of William Gillette's play, it begins with Holmes and Watson as fellow university students, charting his first encounter with Moriarty (on learning the fate of various detectives who have tried to bring him to book, Holmes responds ""Oh! - Well, of course, if you're as difficult to know as all that, I'd better be getting back to my microbes"") that sets him on a life of fighting crime. But along the way we get Holmes rustically ruminating on human nature and, of all things, falling in love at first sight with Carol Dempster's innocent girl and spending much of the first half of the film in a daze. Or it could be plain disinterest as Barrymore hardly seems terribly engaged with his role, going through the motions of concentrating and staring into the far distance while making little impression. Not that he has much to work with, Holmes going by instinct rather than deductive reasoning - `It's easier for me to know Wells is guilty than to explain how I know it' he admits early in the game - while only briefly demonstrating his deductive reasoning in a scene with a clumsily shaved Roland Young's underemployed Watson. As for the domestic revelation in the last scene, it's enough to give the hardcore Holmes fans a fit, though it is rather obvious that Barrymore's real-life hatred for co-star Dempster led to him insisting on a stand in for her in their final clinch.Holmes isn't the only one to get a bit of a makeover. Gustav Von Seyffertitz's scruffy Moriarty, introduced in the middle of a spider's web and operating from a torture dungeon in Limehouse, seems inspired more by Barrymore's Mr Hyde than Doyle while, aside from a paperboy in the unsatisfactorily perfunctory ending, the closest it gets to a Baker Street Irregular is William Powell in his first film as a thief who defects to Holmes' side and whose fate is left vague for much of the last part of the film by the still missing footage. Whereby hangs a tale.The film was lost for decades until the negative of several cans of out of order sequences were found in George Eastman House in 1970, with Kevin Brownlow and William K. Everson screening them for director Albert Parker and basing the lengthy restoration (funded by Hugh Hefner and the National Parks Foundation among others over more than three decades) on his notes. Unfortunately things get rather confusing towards the end thanks to some still missing footage: where public screenings of the restoration filled in the gaps with stills and explanatory captions, Kino Video's extras-free DVD from 2008 makes no such concessions, with events around Holmes' second encounter with Moriarty particularly abrupt (a wounded man and a rejected proposition referred to in one title card literally come out of nowhere while another segment ends abruptly). One for the Barrymore and Holmes completists only, though it is amusing to note that even in 1922 films were making in-jokes about evil masterminds wasting time on elaborate death traps rather than simply killing their nemesis the easy way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5VTFFUY3QEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024OW20Q#wasThisHelpful","R2H5VTFFUY3QEQ","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Metro's 1922 version of The Prisoner of Zenda is an early example of what would later become the house style for many forgotten prestige pictures at MGM in the Thirties: a lot of money, a lot of class but not a lot of panache or excitement for much of the running time. It's a solid rather than inspired adaptation (already the third) that's hampered somewhat by a plot that isn't always silent movie-friendly, with much of the first half of the film taken up with character actors sitting at tables delivering exposition. Lewis Stone may be closer to novelist Anthony Hope's hero Rudolf Rassendyll than later incarnations, very much the distinguished and capable middle aged English gentleman but not exactly over-blessed with charisma in either role, though at times he looks so very like Ronald Colman you can understand why the latter would be cast in the classic 1937 version. For charisma you have to look to Ramon Novarro's charmingly duplicitous Rupert of Hentzau (""While you're unhung, Hell lacks its master!""): just on the cusp of stardom and heroic roles he knows he's got the best part in the picture and knows just how to steal it. Other key roles, like Robert Edeson's Colonel Zapt, aren't so well cast as in later versions, but Alice Terry and Barbara La Marr make formidable leading ladies.Rex Ingram's direction is somewhat hit and miss. He never disgraces himself but he seems hampered by the talkative nature of the plot and in the first half of the film it's only in sporadic scenes like the coronation that he really seems to show what he can do. As if realising this the second half peps up quite substantially with assassination attempts, swordfights and the rescue of the real king from Zenda, all of which may not be as elaborately executed as later versions but are still undeniably enjoyable. In the process the growing love story between Rassendyll and the King's betrothed tends to get short shrift and has to be taken largely on faith, which takes some of the pathos away from the inevitable ending when honour trumps desire. Nonetheless, it's one of those stories it's almost impossible to not make an entertaining film out of (though Peter Sellers and company certainly did their best, or worst) and it's certainly one of the better adaptations even if it doesn't measure up to Colman and Stewart Granger's times trying out the crown of Ruritania for size.Warner Archive's DVD-R is taken from a reissue print that capitalised on Novarro's stardom by giving him top billing (he was originally billed as Ramon Samaniego) and which is apparently twelve minutes shorter than the original release.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2288X3IY8DE4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046CLSGS#wasThisHelpful","R2288X3IY8DE4P","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the enduring popularity of George Macdonald Fraser's novels, the exploits of Harry Flashman, the school bully who made Tom Brown's schooldays such an ordeal and whose subsequently chronicled military career saw him popping up across the globe at historically propitious moments, didn't have much luck with the big screen. An attempt to film Flashman, the first novel, with John Alderton as the bounder and Richard Lester directing was cancelled only days before shooting was scheduled to start in 1970 and even after Lester and Macdonald were coming off the success of The Three and Four Musketeers, 1975's Royal Flash came almost as close to being cancelled before a last-minute change of studios saved the day only for the film's box-office failure to kill off all hope of sequels. Which is a shame, because it's a wonderful comedy adventure spin on The Prisoner of Zenda (the novel's conceit is that it was Anthony Hope who stole the idea after Flashman told him of his exploits) which just happens to involve real historical figures like Otto Von Bismarck (a coldly pompous Oliver Reed), Lola Montes (Florinda Bolkan), King Ludwig of Bavaria and even bare-knuckle boxer-turned-Member of Parliament John Gully (`Our `Enry' Copper, dubbed by Norman Rossington).Flashman's certainly a wonderful comic hero for an increasingly cynical and disillusioned age. The hero of Afghanistan is almost the British Empire incarnate in all its self-righteous self-serving cynicism, a shamelessly xenophobic exploiter who wraps himself up in all the great British values he doesn't hold but who still constantly ends up doing some good by complete accident and bad luck while trying to fill his boots. He's not exactly a complete coward, though he always tries to manipulate the odds in his favour (""Come on down and fight like a man."" ""Don't be ridiculous!""), he's certainly a braggart and a bigot and the kind of person who is always absolutely guaranteed to let you down and steal your girlfriend and your last five pounds in the process, yet, as Big George Webley says in one of the DVD and Bluray's accompanying featurettes, you still want to be his mate.While Fraser's first choice for the role, Errol Flynn, was too dead and his second, David Niven, too old, Malcolm McDowall makes a very pleasing and surprisingly acrobatic substitute even if the surface emphasis shifts from charm to selfishness, and he's surrounded by an excellent supporting cast - Alan Bates on wonderfully witty form and an excellent foil for McDowall in the Rupert of Hentzau role, Britt Ekland cast against type as a frigid duchess, Alastair Sim (not given much to do in one of his last roles), Lionel Jeffries, Tom Bell, Joss Ackland, Christopher Cazenove (who could have made a decent Flashman himself had his profile been higher), Michael Hordern, Bob Hoskins and David Jason. It's given top notch production values too, from cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth to production design by Terence Marsh and some excellent location work in Bavaria. All of which would just be window dressing if it weren't for the film's wickedly entertaining sense of fun that at once manages to debunk period swashbucklers while celebrating them, with Lester throwing in some wonderful sight gags (one with a bored maid washing the floor at an especially dramatic moment in the story is a particular gem) without losing sight of the story. As the TV spot included on the disc says, it's `A terribly funny film with absolutely no redeeming social value,' and one which definitely seems to have improved with age.Like Fox's DVD release, Twilight Time's limited edition region-free Blu-ray of the general release version doesn't offer any of the deleted scenes (the film was trimmed after previewing badly, losing Arthur Lowe and Roy Kinnear's scenes) but does have the same satisfying extras package, pride of place going to an enjoyable audio commentary with McDowall affectionately looking back on the film (he's particularly good on his warm relationship with Bates and how they had to rewrite the script to appeal to his admitted vanity and on Sim's tendency to sputter his lines causing him to despair of having to dub his lines). Also included are two featurettes featuring Fraser and both his admirers and some of those who worked on the film, one on the making of the film, the other on the Flashman books, and isolated music and effects track and a booklet (a different one to that included on Fox's DVD). The impressive transfer is a noticeable improvement over the DVD version, though like many 70s films it does occasionally have a deliberately diffused look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUXPB8OJM88X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRC4I3E#wasThisHelpful","R1YUXPB8OJM88X","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not to be confused with William Wellman's silent epic nor the long-running US sitcom, the BBC's all but forgotten 1976-7 series Wings is probably the best drama series ever produced about the First World War. Tracing the development of the Royal Flying Corps from its early use as a largely ineffectual form of reconnaissance for artillery to the early days of bombing and aerial combat through the experiences of a handful of pilots, it's a surprisingly lavish production with an epic scope that takes in both family life at home and the experiences of the infantry on the ground for whom aircraft always spelled trouble and who weren't averse to firing on their own planes to deter them in the early days.The first series focuses on the early days of the war when dogfights took place between pilots armed only with rifles and handguns who would wave to each other after each unsuccessful attempt to kill each other, managing to find a fine balance between the genuine romance and limitations of early flight and its dangers. The aerial scenes aren't that plentiful but are well executed, and there's a good sense of the growing escalation of the war, with the series building up from the paltry basic training to standout frontline episodes like Over the Top, when things start to get nastier and early chivalry gives way to pragmatism.Best of all, it takes its time to develop characters and situations naturally without ever seeming either rushed or padded out. Tim Woodward's country boy who only gets the chance to actually fly once his `betters' are killed off at such a rate that the RFC is forced to abandon its gentlemen only attitude to pilots, Michael Cochrane's likeable upper class pilot, Nicholas Jones charismatic but increasingly bitter flight commander and John Hallam's war wounded uncle back home might seem at first to be stock characters, but the strong writing makes them credible human beings who don't always act the way stereotypes of their respective classes in this kind of drama. Nor does it always opt for easy stereotypes in the passing parade of supporting characters - far from turning out to be a dead loss, one pompous oaf turns out to be an excellent observer and a superb marksman in the air but resolutely remains an obnoxious pompous oaf who never fits in despite his courage rather than suddenly learning the error of his ways and becoming one of the boys. Instead it manages to accurately portray the attitudes of the day without grafting too modern sensibilities or disillusionment onto its characters: they're convincingly of their time and class even as those times and class distinctions are being worn away by the war.It's also surprisingly good at the emotional confusion caused by the breakdown in the old class system that happened during the was as the rapid turnover in human lives led to the lines between officer class and other ranks becoming blurred as people were regularly promoted `beyond their station' for the first time: neither side really knows quite how to handle it, so handle it badly. Emotional partings are similarly awkward, with Tim Woodward's hero all-too-convincingly inarticulate when trying to explain to his fiancé why he broke up with her and failing miserably. The result is a drama that's as compelling on the ground as it is in the air, going beyond its small corner of the conflict to convey a real sense of why the First World War was such a world changing event both at the front and at home in a way few dramas have ever managed before. While the second series sadly veered into Boys Own clichés and more obvious in some episodes, the first series is one of the best and most undervalued television dramas of the 70s.Series two sees the war in the air escalating, along with the body count and sense of doom, and the scope of the series shifting. Sadly in the process John Hallam's character is written out after a single episode, the emphasis of the side plots shifting from the Home Front to the German aviators. The result is a very mixed bag of a series. The action scenes are considerably better than the first series, and not just the dogfights - an air raid and its aftermath in Dawn Attack is particularly convincing - and it convincingly raises the stages as the war moves into a stage where anyone can die - and one prominent character does, his plane still circling eerily long after he does - and where generals refer to infantry casualties as `stuff on the ground.' The relationships shift too as friends fall out and nerves shred, but in the process it increasingly flirts with stock melodrama, presumably in an attempt to chase higher ratings.Unfortunately it also veers into Boys Own cliché with a little too much of the kind of comic-book heroics the first season scrupulously avoided, what with characters landing behind enemy lines to take out machinegun nests and kidnap German generals. And it doesn't take long for this sporadic move into action series territory to take hold - it's only a couple of episodes in the run when Nicholas Jones' Captain Triggers falls in love with a beautiful spy, is captured by Germans and sentenced to death and escapes with absurd ease to take his improbable revenge with even more absurd ease. Things do get back on track the next episode as one major character finally cracks under the strain but there's still a tendency towards melodrama, albeit very well executed, in subsequent plot developments. Similarly the character of Kate undergoes not just a change of actress but a complete change of personality, turning from a progressive woman into a catty snobThere's less of an attempt to look at the entire war in the context of what it meant to people at the time and the changes it would herald for the future. Rather than a running thread throughout the series, it tends to crop up in intermittent episodes like Officers and Gentlemen, about the social impact of promoting people who didn't go to the right schools and weren't born with a sense of entitlement to authority (far from going for class war clichés, the episode acknowledges that there was more resentment from the `lower orders' who preferred to be led by well-bred idiots when one of their own stepped out of his place) or Guardian Angel, about the opposition - not just from generals but pilots as well - to parachutes, which were still regarded as an `invitation to cowardice.' Then there's The Price, about the problems of developing new aircraft that won't kill inexperienced pilots after being stuck with planes where the only chance of taking down an enemy is a head-on collision, while the penultimate episode does finally deal with troubled relationship with French allies and civilian casualties. But these aren't enough to change the feeling that it's gone from being a consistently excellent series to a series with some excellent episodes.While the remaining years of the first war in the air provided ample dramatic opportunities, it's perhaps for the best that this never continued for a third or fourth series despite its unresolved ending. It's certainly still a cut above most TV attempts to deal with WW1 and well worth watching, but it's hard not to notice the drop in quality and ambition between the two seasons.Simply's extras-free UK PAL DVD offers all episodes of both seasons in decent transfers considering the limitations of the original series (as per almost all shows of the day it's a mixture on shot-on-videotape interiors and 16mm film exteriors).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IK8N5DBYE5YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00429WO86#wasThisHelpful","R2IK8N5DBYE5YP","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Starring a young Paul Newman and, in his first major role, Clint Eastwood, director William Wellman returned to the theme of his Oscar-winning Wings and his own experiences as an American pilot flying for the French in World War One with 1958's epic Lafayette Escadrille, a fitting swansong for one of the great directors of the golden age - or at least that's what SHOULD have happened. Instead Jack Warner balked at the budget, insisted on casting Tab Hunter instead of the lesser-known actors (Eastwood's role went to David Janssen, leaving him in a small bit part), added a happier ending and cut the film to ribbons in post-production before changing the title to Hell Bent for Glory, with the bitterly disillusioned director never making another film. The scars are all too visible in the rushed pacing and jarring plotholes left by scenes that never made it to the final cut, the opening of the film in particular looking like someone attempted to crudely shoehorn 20 minutes of plot development from an already badly compromised script into five minutes of surviving footage that looks like it's been edited with a lawnmower.Some moments do survive, but they're few and far between. The heroes' first night in their barracks moves from a flat comic scene to a quietly mournful one where Wellman's own narration identifies of the real-life pilots sleeping alongside them by name and describes their impending deaths, and its here that you see the kind of no-nonsense tribute to the friends he left behind that he so clearly wanted to make. Wellman himself is actually a supporting character in the film, played by his own son, while Tab Hunter's hero isn't a million miles away from the kind of troubled delinquent `Wild Bill' was himself, a spoiled brat running away from a hit-and-run accident (it's tempting to see Wellman's original ending that saw him die as a kind of survivor's guilt that so many who survived the Great War when `better' men died sometimes expressed).Unfortunately the result is just a flat, Earthbound backlot melodrama with some variably staged service comedy that abandons the fledgling fliers at the halfway point as Hunter deserts to marry Etchika Choureau's hustler-turned-nice-girl. Choureau's a pretty girl and there's a nice sequence with her blowing on the sleeping Hunter's face to wake him up, but they never make a strong or convincing enough couple to make you regard their romance as anything but a distraction from what a film called Lafayette Escadrille should really be about. The film rarely gets off the ground and does little that's interesting when it does, becoming surprisingly dreary in the mid-section with Hunter hiding out in her apartment and making a furtive living trawling bars and persuading servicemen to visit one of the local brothels. Naturally his conscience gets the better of him when the film finally realises there's a war on (something there's very little sense of for most of the running time) and he rejoins the squadron, earns his wings and the film finally gets round to having some aerial footage and a dogfight in the last reel. This footage is often quite good, but it's too little too late, feeling arbitrarily slapped on. Worse, there's no real connection to or affection for the character to get you involved, something that would have been just as big a problem had the original ending where Hunter died and his sweetheart committed suicide been retained. All in all it's a sad swansong for a great director and a poor memorial to the pioneer air aces he flew alongside.Still, Warner Home Video's extras-free manufactured-on-demand PAL DVD-R at least offers a very decent black and white widescreen transfer and Leonard Rosenman's score finds a better love theme for its main characters than the film probably deserves.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYFPLDOFT396/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00652FG24#wasThisHelpful","R2LYFPLDOFT396","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even in the Golden Age of Hollywood, the carnage of World War One always made it a difficult setting for adventure films, but 1971's Zeppelin gets around that by sidestepping the war on the ground for a ripping yarn largely set on one of the elegant but deadly airships. Michael York's the nice-but-bland deskbound half-German half-Scottish British officer with an impeccably British accent and a bad case of vertigo who is recruited by Alexandra Stewart's Mata Hari-like spy to join his German relatives and help with their latest experimental Zeppelin. Of course, he's really working for the Brits all along - something designer's wife Elke Sommer guesses right from the start but does nothing about - but before he can get down to any serious spying he's whisked off on a test flight that turns out to be cover for a secret mission over Scotland. It's the kind of rather cosy, reasonably well-mounted film that the British film industry was still turning out in the early 70s even though audiences were abandoning them. Short on action and incident until things perk up considerably in the final raid, it relies instead on mystery as to what the devious plan is, not generating much suspense or threat aside from one sequence with a radio operator but floating along effectively enough in its Sunday teatime telly viewing way.J. Paul Getty Sr.'s company may have made a tidy sum selling oil to the Germans for their airships, but when his son Ronald decided to try his luck as a producer, the old man was reluctant to see much of that money going in the opposite direction, and you do get the impression at times that the script got scaled down to fit the fairly modest budget. Nonetheless, the special effects are mostly pretty decent there's a good cast of the usual suspects like Anton Diffring in his default charmingly distrustful aristocratic Hun mode, Peter Carsten as his Aryan ubermensch cohort and British movie regulars like Andrew Keir, Marius Goring and Rupert Davies along for the flight. Despite opening with an air raid it's rather short of thrills, never being particularly thrilling until its satisfying finale but compensating somewhat with an impressive use of the widescreen frame despite its often-cramped quarters. There's also some guilty fun to be had waiting for some of the Germans to display their heavily telegraphed lemming-like tendencies when the ship needs to lose some weight. While there's little sense of danger in the film, the crew weren't so lucky - during the filming famed aerial cinematographer Skeets Kelly (Battle of Britain, The Blue Max, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines) and three others died in a helicopter/plane collision. But for that tragic accident the worst you could say about the film is that it's harmless enough, and that if it's not the action-packed white-knuckle ride some may hope for it does eventually deliver its payload.Warner Archive's manufactured-on-demand DVD-R offers no extras but does at least feature a very nice cleaned up 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and, unlike the Spanish DVD, is uncut.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6PNVMXJEE26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L2BZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R1T6PNVMXJEE26","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shot in English with a largely German cast, Nikolai Mullerschon's 2008 German would-be epic The Red Baron is perhaps somewhat better and slightly more ambitious than the recent Flyboys, but it still pales beside earlier films about the first war in the air like Aces High and, in particular, The Blue Max, which it at times strives to emulate. But where John Guillermin's film had a genuinely ruthless anti-hero and stunning aerial sequences shot in real planes, this quickly chips away at its hero's early arrogance to find the New Man underneath and too often limits the dogfights to brief green screen and CGI sequences that are good enough but not particularly convincing (though at least are slightly better photographed than the soft and undetailed scenes on terra firma). But while it spends far too much time on the ground and never offers a single prolonged or outstanding aerial setpiece to energise the film, it's not without redeeming features, offering Von Richthofen as the first superstar air ace, star of a thousand battlefront postcards who even has French prisoners stopping him to ask for autographs he gladly signs. There is even some attempt to look at the psychology behind his tactics and the propaganda machinations behind his rise to fame, Germany's need for a hero combining with his initial arrogance, thrill of the hunt and ideal of fighting a war with grace to create the perfect media-friendly heroic image in an increasingly ugly war, while it acknowledges the incestuous nature of the war in Europe, with relatives fighting on either side in family ties that mirror the old collapsed system of European alliances. Unfortunately it raises issues but only pays them lip service and all too often dumbs down with rushed scenes and on-the-nose dialogue that spells everything out far too specifically - it even adds captions like `Berlin, capital of the German Empire' for those who flunked their basic geography.Matthias Schweighofer is adequate in the early scenes where Von Richthofen's arrogance exceeds his actions, but develops little gravitas as the role progresses, underlining the bland predictability of the character's journey from exhilaration to disillusion as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his role as a propaganda tool. Til Schweiger and Lena Headey fare rather better in their clichéd roles, though Joseph Fiennes is unable to do anything with his painfully trite scenes as Roy Brown, the Canadian air ace credited with shooting down Von Richthofen (the film dodges that controversy by not showing the Baron's demise, giving him a romantic farewell before flying off into legend instead). Rather than offering any alternate perspective to the Red Baron's view of war, he's simply there to help facilitate the German ace's relationship with Headey's nurse, who opens his eyes to the true horrors of war and turns him into a politically correct jaded 21st Century figure who even answers back the Kaiser about the futility of mechanised murder in the hope of making him more acceptable to modern audiences. Unfortunately it tends to make him rather bland and anachronistic instead, something the sporadically inappropriate moments of clichéd world music in Stefan Hansen and Dirk Reichardt's score only amplifies. The end result is a watchable but unconvincingly romanticised potboiler that never does its subject or its setting justice and never offers the kind of thrilling scenes in the air that films made over half a century ago did.Monterey's US Bluray and DVD release of the film is heavily cut from 129-minutes to 106, but the uncut English-language version is available in a region-free Blu-ray edition in the UK from Showbox's with an acceptable 2.35:1 widescreen transfer considering the weaknesses of the original cinematography and a decent array of extras: making of and visual effects featurettes, 6 brief deleted scenes, outtakes, stills gallery, trailer and, er, music video of the end title song - yes, the film ends with a German pop song...","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1231R2PBQ3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039USJBK#wasThisHelpful","R1I1231R2PBQ3A","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very much the odd man out in Roger Corman's filmography, Von Richtofen and Brown is the kind of picture that's been despised by those military historians for its many inaccuracies long before it was established that Brown wasn't responsible for shooting down the ace and has never enjoyed much of a reputation with general audiences or critics either. Yet taken in its own terms it's a particularly fine allegory of the death of delusional notions of chivalry and the beginning of mass mechanised murder as it charts the twin courses of the Prussian aristocrat who is embraced by his comrades and the Canadian garage mechanic who is rejected by his. That Brown was actually the son of a local power company owner who was studying business administration before the war and had a very different attitude to aerial combat that the one he espouses in the film gives some idea of how much historical accuracy you can expect, but this is more about myth-making in a realistic setting than facts, printing the legend from a disillusioned 70s perspective.Corman's last directorial credit until Frankenstein Unbound, it was not a lucky picture - one pilot died, production was briefly shut down due to a plane crash unrelated to the film and there was a potentially fatal bird strike crash involving Don Stroud and pilot Lynn Garrison that left them treading water for 45 minutes before being rescued. Critics were unimpressed, box-office was poor and the film merely regarded as an anomaly in Corman's work. Yet it's one of his most intriguing and incisive films and infinitely better than the politically correct and even more inaccurate recent German take on the legend, The Red Baron [Blu-ray], that reduced Von Richtofen and Brown (who never met on the ground) not only into frenemies but romantic rivals for the same nurse. Instead it casts them as the embodiment of two different approaches to the business of killing who blaze a trail for the more callous men who follow and overtake them as the war constantly escalates.John Philip Law's Von Richtofen is the Prussian military ideal, an aristocrat bred for war and embraced by his comrades, nimbly walking a tightrope between notions of chivalry and honour and ruthlessness: as he amply demonstrates on the pool table, ""The game is not to give but to take."" He's at once a proud part of the old order but enough of a pioneer to embrace new technology and previously unthinkable tactics, becoming a public idol, propaganda tool and a political pawn in the process. He revels in his success and the adoration of (most of) his men, casting silver trophies for each new kill, or at least until war shortages mean the silver runs out and is replaced by base metal.In stark contrast, Don Stroud's Brown is an outsider in a gentlemen's corps that believes that ""men can be enemies without becoming beasts. Those who survive this business will find they still have need of those traditions which separate gentlemen from savages."" Rather than play the magnanimous rival and toast his enemies, he regards himself as ""just a technician. I change things. Put a plane in front of me, with a man in it, I change them into a wreck and a corpse."" He's despised by the old guard because they're forced to agree with his view that the war will be won by men, not knights. But while he thinks he's stripping away the pretence of war as if he were stripping down an engine to fix it, he comes to realise that there's a need for those seemingly idiotic gestures: ""We have to pretend or go mad."" Where his pragmatism is born of a contempt for the myths of glorious death that justify continuing slaughter, he finds the men who replace the old order regarding it far more callously and removing the human element entirely. As one cheerfully tells him, ""We're not talking about philosophy. War is a problem in applied physics.""But both men find their own ruthlessness exceeded by others and can only watch as the world goes mad around them. Brown's fiercest critics and enemies among his own ranks become more genuinely bloodthirsty than him as the pretence is stripped away as the gentleman officers are killed off. Even the adoration and authority Von Richtofen's celebrity endows on him is gradually eroded as he outlives his time, seeing his breed of professional gentleman soldier replaced first by reluctant conscripts who, far from revelling in the chance to prove themselves on the field of battle, feel like pheasants in the Fall, and later by more ruthless men already planning the next war while acknowledging this one is lost. As the war and the film nears its bleak conclusion, he finds himself increasingly at odds with Hermann Goering's mentality that civilians are legitimate targets (not historically accurate, but it's a valid artistic choice considering the way Goering would adopt just that approach in the Second World War). Yet his objections that ""You're not a soldier, you're an assassin"" are not only rebuffed with ""The soldiers are losing. I make war to win. Doesn't matter how,"" but he finds himself becoming the outsider as the other jaded pilots fail to share his outrage at this pragmatic lack of honour. And as the final dogfight looms ever closer, the roots of Nazism become ever more apparent, whether it's the Baron's father (Ferdy Mayne) or the high command planning to use the army for political housecleaning once the war is over.The leads are well cast, Corman cannily turning their limitations into strengths. Law, the kind of Fabio Testi-like actor whose `special skills' section on his resume was probably limited to `Tall, good looking, great posture: really good at standing to attention,' is ideal, getting to show a bit more range than usual (his reaction to a bloodthirsty pep talk from the Kaiser is a gem) but never given anything that will tax his abilities in a part that plays surprisingly well to his strengths. Brando-alike Stroud has more range as an actor but reins in his bitterness effectively, and his lack of major star status that did the film no favors at the box-office works well as the unlikely hero who sticks out like a sore thumb.As usual with Corman he gets a lot of bang for his buck, avoiding the lengthy weather delays that played havoc with The Blue Max and Darling Lili's budgets by shooting on `Blue Days, Grey Days and Don't Give a Damn Days' rather than waiting for ideal conditions. He not only packs a lot of ideas and incident into his 96 minutes of screen time but also gets some fine production values along the way, from an interesting supporting cast filled with never-quite-made-it familiar faces (Hurd Hatfield, a dubbed Barry Primus, Stephen McHattie, Corin Redgrave, Tom Adams) to Hugo Friedhofer's classy score. That the planes aren't always the right models is down to Corman using the squadron and many of the sets built for The Blue Max six years earlier, and they're put to particularly good use here over the skies of Ireland even if there are no standout virtuoso dogfight sequences - the emphasis here is more on the relentless business of death than visceral excitement. Not that the footage isn't impressive, especially when it very clearly really is the actors in the air (sometimes even getting bloodily shot up), the in-flight cockpit shots never relying on back projection or special effects. It may cut away to stunt flyers for the tricky stuff, but seeing their faces distorted by the speed really adds to the film's credibility in the air.It may not have the obvious cult appeal of Corman's classic Poe adaptations and it's not for those more interested in pedantic details or broader historical facts, but despite its occasional shortcomings, Von Richtofen and Brown is a fine bit of contemplative mythmaking that deserves rediscovery and re-evaluation.While MGM/UA's NTSC DVD offers an acceptable but unexciting transfer, it's recently been given a fine Blu-ray release in Germany, with a superior transfer that's much truer to the original look of the film, stills gallery, German and US trailers (the latter without any captions or credits) and a recent 32-minute interview in English with Corman to promote the release of Corman's World in Germany. Von Richtofen and Brown is only mentioned briefly, but it's an interesting dip into his career with the genial producer-director on articulate form about the problems facing independent producers in a theatrical market now dominated by big budget studio fare and with declining DVD revenues. Well worth seeking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATES3GNM0AWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UJFGUU#wasThisHelpful","RATES3GNM0AWO","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very much Room at the Top with biplanes and battlefields instead of bedsits and boardrooms, The Blue Max follows the progress of Bruno Stachel (George Peppard), a former German infantryman who sees becoming an air ace as a means of climbing out of the trenches and up the social ladder. While aristocratic general James Mason uses him to provide the demoralised working class with a hero of their own and the general's wife (Ursula Andress, modelling a line of gravity-defying towels evidently superglued to her nipples) uses him to pass the time, his desire to win the Blue Max, the highest award Germany can give, to prove that he is as good as his condescending, socially superior comrades sets him at odds with Karl Michael Vogler's squadron commander, who simply wants to fight the war with chivalry, and Jeremy Kemp's famous ace.This is one of those films that should be great but never quite makes it. Part of the problem is the watering down of Jack D. Hunter's original novel, which saw Stachel and his buddy Hermann go on to form Hitler's Luftwaffe, a more convincing conclusion to the class warfare and erosion of aristocratic values than the (admittedly ruthless) one the film offers in its place. Similarly Jerry's Goldsmith's beautiful and justly celebrated score found itself equally watered down, with many of his most ambitious and powerful cues either left unused or heavily abridged to fit in more plays of his soaring and euphoric main title (more of that later).Although one of the few films from the Sixties where when a plane crashes it doesn't go over a hill to do it, it suffers in comparison to silent classic Wings both from its occasional back projection and its lack of that film's real emotional power because, while the characters often fascinate, they're not anyone you're likely to root for. Peppard still displays the early promise that was never quite fulfilled as the charismatic but utterly ruthless working-class obsessive, striking a nice balance between defensive vulnerability in his early scenes and unbridled ambition in his latter ones, but he is more a character you understand than sympathise with.John Guillermin's direction is certainly ambitious with a striking use of the camera and a particularly effective use of tracking shots, though some of the tilted angles and overhead shots can make it seem a little Ipcress File at times. Yet if never entirely successful, there is still a lot to recommend it. It retains its schoolboy appeal without insulting the intelligence, is superbly designed and holds the interest throughout, while Skeets Kelly's aerial work from the days when they still used real planes and real extras rather than cartoonish digital FX is often astounding. And when its ambitions are occasionally realised, such as the bombing of an infantry column or a mass attack, it's strikingly effective.The film hasn't been too lucky on home video in the past: the first widescreen VHS release omitted the entire attack sequence that saw Stachel saving the Red Baron's life and earning The Blue Max while the subsequent widescreen DVD only had a trailer. The German Blu-ray didn't even have that, and sported a less than impressive transfer too. Thankfully Twilight Time's limited edition region-free Blu-ray release uses a much better recent transfer that's very impressive, and, along with the trailer and some perceptive observations from Julie Kirgo in the accompanying booklet, includes not one but two isolated score tracks for Jerry Goldsmith's remarkable score - one an extended version of the full score, the other including alternate cues and filling in the gaps with a film historians' audio commentary. Goldsmith wrote a lot more music than was used in the film, which opted to reuse his main theme in places he'd written different cues for and in others remove them entirely, and although the deleted cues aren't mixed in with the soundtrack, it's amazing to hear his bravura six minute cue for the German attack sequence that was completely removed in favor of sound effects finally against the sequence, which really transforms the scene and leaves you questioning the sanity of whoever decided to ditch it.Very highly recommended indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCPZJ395WEJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKPXX92#wasThisHelpful","RFCPZJ395WEJF","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How times change. Back in 1974, after paying his dues co-writing Silent Running and Magnum Force, Michael Cimino was one of the most promising new directors on the scene thanks to his directorial debut Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. In 1978 he was an Oscar winner whose place in movie history seemed assured by The Deer Hunter. Two years later he was the poster boy for directorial excess and hubris in the wake of the unjustly maligned Heaven’s Gate. Now he’s unemployable.Thunderbolt’s once-sterling reputation seems to have fallen victim alongside Cimino’s career. It’s become one of the less-remembered films from the days when Clint Eastwood ruled the box-office yet it holds up as one of the best pictures of its over-rated decade, managing the neat trick of both delivering what the audience wants and subverting their expectations at the same time. Eastwood plays a crook on the run from ex-partners in crime George Kennedy and Geoffrey Lewis (often hysterically funny here) who teams up with Jeff Bridges' extrovert drifter to retrieve the loot from a previous robbery only to find his old accomplices tagging along and things – naturally – not going at all to plan. It’s an almost perfectly judged mixture of comedy and action with both feet firmly on the ground despite the more absurd moments in a way that would be almost unthinkable today. There's a real rapport between the outstanding cast and an affection for the characters that adds to the impact of the very Seventies ending – not only is the central pairing of Eastwood’s old hand and Bridges’ cocksure kid far more convincing and genuinely affecting than it has any right to be, but Kennedy and Lewis’ untrustworthy partners in crime are beautifully drawn too.Cimino handles the mood swings adeptly and even injects a subtle undercurrent of sexual ambiguity that never gets in the way of the entertainment. While his direction is bang on target - there’s a great use of mid-Western landscape too - it’s the strength of his script that keeps the film surprisingly fresh today. It’s basically a road movie crossed with a heist movie, but Cimino throws in so many unexpected and quirky left turns that catch you off guard that you never get the feeling that you’re going over the same old ground. This was a terrific movie in 1974, and if anything it's an even better one today. Just remember; never accept a lift from a man with a raccoon in the passenger seat and a trunk full of bunnies!While MGM/UA's DVD release had a poor non-anamorphic transfer and only a trailer as extra, Twilight Time's limited edition Blu-ray is a massive improvement with a fine 2.35:1 transfer, isolated score track, film historians' audio commentary, trailer and booklet, finally giving the film some of the love it deserves on home video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D89JBBD28A7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFHUMNU#wasThisHelpful","R2D89JBBD28A7P","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Determinedly arthouse despite its purely commercial pulp plot, Cooper's The Disappearance - a film that disappeared from distribution for decades itself - isn't particularly good, yet there's still something there that keeps drawing you back every decade or so to see if it's got any better. It hasn't, yet there's still something haunting about this mood piece's chilly atmosphere and alienated emotional landscape. Shot in snowy Canada and England in late fall to take advantage of two sets of tax breaks, Donald Sutherland's the expert hitman too preoccupied with the disappearance of his wife (Sutherland's offscreen partner Francine Racette) to accept a 'shy' from his increasingly impatient bosses, who run their assassination bureau from a smart office like a management consultancy. There's more brooding on where their relationship may have fallen apart than thriller mechanics, with the coldness of the landscape spreading to the interiors and the characters. At times you feel this wants to be a slightly Boormanesque exercise in subverting the genre a la Point Blank (unsurprisingly, Lee Marvin was Cooper's first choice for the lead), particularly in the opening assassination on an abandoned ship, but the idea's often better than the execution.Still, Cooper assembles a good cast to keep things interesting: David Warner, an unseen voice of authority figures in Cooper's previous film Overlord, appears onscreen this time as a disillusioned assassination executive, a young John Hurt is the too eager assassin's apprentice Sutherland finds himself saddled with, Virginia McKenna is remarkably effective as the wife of the potential target who has long since lost her illusions about her marriage, Peter Bowles does a nice line in corporate slime, Christopher Plummer turns up turns up to give an object lesson in how to almost steal a film with less than three minutes screentime in one effective confrontation and there's a chance to see co-producer David Hemmings giving a nicely understated cameo as Racette's equally obsessed ex-husband in the days before his eyebrows became large enough to support their own weather system. It's definitely a film whose credits lead you to expect more - it's adapted from a novel by Derek Marlowe, always better at premise than plotting, with a screenplay by two-time Nic Roeg collaborator Paul Mayersberg with crisp, clinical cinematography by Kubrick favorite John Alcott - but while it repeatedly fails to deliver still leaves a few resonant echoes in its wake.Twilight Time's Region A-locked limited edition Blu-ray offers two of the three cuts of the film that exist. The best and most familiar to UK audiences from its screening on UK TV and very brief subsequent arthouse cinema release is the 101-minute director's cut. They've obvious only had access to a standard definition master, which is too dark in places, fullframe and has moments where the edge enhancement is a bit wobbly, but is still acceptable considering the film's rarity. The shorter 91-minute cut of the film offered in a beautifully remastered high definition widescreen transfer is something of a mystery: unlike the much reviled chronologically re-edited US version with a hideously inappropriate semi-disco synth score that was pulled from release after a single day (the opening 15 minutes of which are included as an extra), this retains the flashback approach but still moves some scenes around - the opening killing, for example, comes much later in the film when Sutherland and Warner discuss it and different shots and alternate takes are used for Sutherland's departure from Canada and his searching the shy's house. As Cooper notes in the accompanying interview on the disc, it's fairly sympathetic to his original intentions and structure, though no-one seems to know quite where it came from or who re-edited it (though there is a theory that co-producer David Hemmings may have had a hand in it while other sources suggest, somewhat less credibly, it was an alternate re-edit by Fima Noveck, who re-edited the US version, this time for the 1983 Canadian release). The fact that this is the version that got remastered implies that the negative got physically recut so there's no likelihood of the director's cut getting a proper remastering, but this version certainly isn't a travesty.Cooper's interview packs quite a lot of information into its nine minutes: his time at RADA with David Warner and John Hurt, his experience as an actor on The Dirty Dozen making him realise he wanted to work on the other side of the camera, the casting process, with Lee Marvin turning down the lead despite liking the script because he'd ""played that part too many times"" and Sutherland requiring a long courtship before accepting the lead, and the film's dismal fate in the US with a small distribution company obsessed with making it `more linear.' There's also an isolated score track - thankfully Robert Farnon's restrained and classical original score that interpolates extracts from Ravel rather than Craig Hundley's funky gibbon disco rescore - and a booklet with notes by Julie Kirgo. The film may never quite achieve its ambitions, but it still exerts a strange fascination and this edition is easily the best treatment it has ever had by far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32AXMB8WJ56SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5BQ96O#wasThisHelpful","R32AXMB8WJ56SX","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The McCarthy-inspired Blacklist in the late 40s and 50s is such a shameful incident in America's history that film and TV has largely steered clear of the subject altogether: you can count the films dealing with it directly on the fingers of one hand, so it sounds like damning with faint praise to say that the rarely revived The Front is the best of them all. That it's the `Woody Allen film' that time forgot hasn't helped it's reputation, but in truth, although many regular Allen collaborators from co-star Michael Murphy to producers Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe are involved, this isn't an Allen film: some of the wisecracks may be tailor-made for him, but this is Martin Ritt and Walter Bernstein's film and Allen's just playing a role, that of a cashier and small-time bookie who finds himself `fronting' for blacklisted writers for 10% of whatever they get for their scripts.Kicking off with a superb scene-setting montage of the 50s at its best and worst, from baseball and apple pie to the Korean War and the execution of the Rosenbergs while Frank Sinatra sings Young at Heart on the soundtrack, it's a film that certainly speaks from personal experience. Along with writer Walter Bernstein and director Martin Ritt (who had both touched upon the blacklist more obliquely in 1970's The Molly Maguires) many of the cast - Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Lloyd Gough, Joshua Shelley - were blacklisted, while the daughter of one of the blacklist's most tragic victims, John Garfield, also appears. Yet surprisingly it's not a whitewash: the blacklisted writers make it clear that they weren't put on the list by mistake but because they are communists, while Allen's front may start out on his new career as a favor to a friend but quickly shows his true opportunistic colors. No sooner has he seen how much money he can make than he's taking on more writers at higher rates, seducing Andrea Marcovicci's production assistant who is really in love with the words that aren't even his own rather than the man himself and getting ideas above his station, refusing to hand in scripts he thinks aren't up to his standards because ""It's my name that goes on the script."" In that he's really no different from anyone else in a world where club owners take advantage of the blacklist to get performers like Mostel's increasingly suicidal Hecky Green at bargain rates and then still knock them down even further after a sell-out show. But it's not long before he becomes a political suspect himself...Set in the fledgling TV industry where gas company sponsors insisted on rewriting concentration camp dramas to avoid giving their product a bad image and where businessmen who only owned a couple of stores could demand - and get - the right of veto over any cast members they thought are `too red' for their customers' liking by threatening to withdraw a single commercial (both true incidents), it doesn't really need to resort to comic invention, but it's more of an absurd yet dry black comedy that's often too dark NOT to laugh at. The final scene where Allen comes up against the committee and tries to bluff his way out of a contempt charge is really just a piece of wish fulfilment, the kind of thing you wish you had said long after the moment has passed, but it's hard to begrudge Ritt and Bernstein their moment: they earned it. Running a tight hour-and-a-half and with great photography by Michael Chapman, it's well worth investigating.While Sony's DVD release offered no extras, Twilight Time's Bluray release more than makes amends with an audio commentary featuring co-star Andrea Marcovicci, isolated score (the Sinatra song is not included on that track, though it remains on the film proper), trailer and booklet, as well as featuring a solid widescreen transfer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYPEP4PHAFDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKPLM8G#wasThisHelpful","R3JYPEP4PHAFDK","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The odds were stacked against The Only Game in Town from the very beginning. One of those hot properties that got cold fast, Frank D. Gilroy's play sold for a record $550,000 before it even opened, 20th Century Fox throwing in an additional $150,000 for him to write the screenplay: just as well, since the critics slaughtered it and it closed in a couple of weeks. Not that that stopped the studio going ahead with their plans to film it even after Frank Sinatra dropped out of the male lead, banking on Elizabeth Taylor's fading star power in a role that had Shirley MacLaine's name, address and phone number written all over it. It didn't help that Sinatra's replacement, a still youthful looking Warren Beatty, only emphasised that Taylor was getting on a bit to play a disillusioned chorus girl who finds a convenient no-strings arrangement with a gambling addicted piano player turning into love. Hiring a perfectionist director notorious for going over budget wasn't the best move either, but the icing on the cake was Taylor's insistence on shooting the Las Vegas-based film in Paris so she could be near Richard Burton while he was filming Staircase, which saw the budget for what is essentially a two-hander set almost entirely in two locations balloon to an incredible $11m. returning barely 10% of the investment at the box-office. Coming off two hugely expensive flops (The Diary of Anne Frank and The Greatest Story Ever told), it proved the last straw for director George Stevens' career, remembered, if at all, as another of those lousy swansongs so common for many major directors. Amazingly, the film got sort of remade to similar lack of success by Curtis Hanson as the almost equally unlucky Lucky You.The film's reputation never recovered from the ill-conceived folly of its casting, production and massive losses, but it's really not that bad at all. Despite being billed as a romantic comedy it's more of a bittersweet drama - Beatty may crack wise, but the only big laughs come from two early close-ups of Taylor bobbing her head in a forlorn effort to try to sell her as part of the chorus in a big Vegas production number. For the most part it's a drama about two losers who drift together, united as much by their inability to break out of their bad habits and losing streaks to grab a chance for happiness as by any growing affection. Indeed, their bond seems to become stronger the more they start to grate on each other's nerves and threaten to go their separate ways. Both stars are on good form, Taylor toning it effectively down despite a script that occasionally throws in reminders that this sort of thing is not what she's really famous for (Liz Taylor playing a gal who gives back a diamond ring?), Beatty cast much more to type in a role that allows him fragile charm and the odd darker moment of self-disgust alike. The only other player who gets any chance to make an impression is Broadway musical performer Charles Braswell as Taylor's married lover, who's good enough to make you wonder why he only made two films and had barely a handful of TV credits to his name.At heart it's a little film, Stevens adopting an almost continental approach to the character piece at times. It's overly dependent on the writing, which is problematic at times: there's a good opening, and a couple of particularly strong scenes in the middle and end of the film but the inbetweens get a bit flabby and at times feel like treading water in a script that could certainly have been a bit tighter. Henri Decae's cinematography is typically impressive, especially when the film gets out of the apartment and briefly onto the streets of Vegas or onto the impressive casino sets, and gets a good showcase on Twilight Time's remastered Blu-ray release that restores it to its original lustre (the disc also gives Maurice Jarre's jazzy lounge-style score an isolated track as well as including a booklet and the original trailer). It's certainly no lost classic, but at its best it's still a more interesting film that it gets credit for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AUS0YIG18S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDXJYNA#wasThisHelpful","R6AUS0YIG18S6","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite its low reputation among devotees of the author, Beloved Infidel is a surprisingly decent attempt to turn a self-destructive F. Scott Fitzgerald's affair with gossip columnist Sheila Graham into a glossy CinemaScope love story in the 20th Century Fox house style of the Fifties. Not that it's going for pure soap, with undervalued and unfairly forgotten A-list director Henry King seemingly using A Star is Born for his template, with his screenwriting career failing because he can't adapt his style to the screen while his books fall out of favour - he can't even find a copy of his book to buy her. The comparisons are particularly pronounced in scenes where Gregory Peck's down on his luck author drunkenly barges in on a rehearsal for a radio broadcast and just keeps on making things worse or when he drunkenly insults an admirer on a plane while Deborah Kerr's would-be muse sits cringing in embarrassment. Elsewhere, it draws parallels with the author's own work as he falls for a woman who, like Jay Gatsby, has reinvented her humble origins but can't forget them.For all his stolid reputation, Peck was always interested in challenging his screen image and even though he's one of the least likely casting choices imaginable for Fitzgerald, he's clearly relishing the opportunity to cut loose in the second half of the picture with the occasional homicidal drunken rage. Kerr's more obviously in her usual comfort zone, worrying, trying to manage a deteriorating situation and suffering as required. King's direction is polished and intelligent, pulling off a couple of nice moments such as their first meeting being played entirely by subtle eye contact or a nightmarish tableaux giving way to a suddenly empty room near the end of the film, though this being a 50s Fox film, the Love is a Man Splendored Thingish final scene where memories give way to a title song that really struggles to find rhymes with Infidel (the most awkward aspect of an excellent Franz Waxman score) is more likely to provoke smirks than tears. It's not the enduring classic it clearly wants to be, but it's still a much better melodrama than its detractors might claim.Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray release offers an excellent transfer in the film's original widescreen ratio, an isolated score track, original trailer and booklet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNEXM6J0KUME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJROM9E#wasThisHelpful","R3VNEXM6J0KUME","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally intended as a Marlon Brando-Henry Hathaway vehicle (the script even retains a joke about Brando), The Wayward Bus is one of those ensemble dramas that’s part-Stagecoach without the Indians and part-disaster movie where the character scenes are more important than the various disasters – mud slide, collapsing flooded bridges, failing brakes – that befall Rick Jason’s rundown bus. With Brando out of the picture, Fox evidently opted to save some money on the cast, with novelist John Steinbeck getting more prominent above the title billing than Joan Collins, Jayne Mansfield or Dan Dailey (well, it was, surprisingly, his biggest selling novel in his lifetime). The two Js are clearly going for a bit of career credibility, Collins appearing with little makeup as the money-grabbing, selfish and greedy roadside café-owning wife that Jason still loves because nobody else does while Mansfield, presumably hoping for a Bus Stop of her very own, is rather more cast-to-type as a stripper on the convention circuit who never married because all the right guys had the wrong ideas but falls for travelling salesman Dan Dailey’s line of patter, all too aware of how long their relationship will last if he finds out how she earns her living. Also along for the bumpy ride are star-struck waitress Betty Lou Keim, Dee Pollack’s teenage handyman, Will Wright’s parsimonious grouch and Larry Keating and Kathryn Givney’s Mr and Mrs Middle America and their nymphomaniac daughter Dolores Michaels.Everyone in the film is driven by lust, but this being 1957 that means more innuendo than action, and what action Jason gets is kept offscreen and implied. While the film definitely has the feeling of the studio eventually deciding to finally get it out of the way after all those years of thwarted development without spending too much money on it (it may have got CinemaScope but the budget didn’t stretch to colour), the B-list casting tends to work in the film’s favour: a cast trying to work its way up or manage its way down is a better match for the assembled losers than a big name cast with more overpowering personalities. Victor Vicas pretty much conned his way into the director’s chair on this one by convincing Darryl F. Zanuck he was a major European director in those pre-IMDB days, and he does a capable enough job and throws in a couple of decently staged moments without ever elevating the picture enough to surprise you that he only made one more American picture. Like its characters, it’s nothing special, but like the rundown bus it gets there in the end.Aside from a rather ropey looking title sequence, Twilight Time's limited edition widescreen Blu-ray release is an impressive transfer in the original widescreen ratio, and includes an audio commentary by Alain Silver and James Ursini, isolated score track, original theatrical trailer and booklet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CH30C6P9HDPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DXPLAK#wasThisHelpful","R1CH30C6P9HDPE","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first 3D film from a major studio to hit theatres - if only by two days - Man in the Dark is pretty much a forgotten footnote to the brief 50s craze for the format, but while you can't make any great claims for it as a movie, it's a lot more entertaining than its obscurity implies because, rather than in spite of, its tendency to constantly throw things at the audience, even including at one point leading man Edmond O'Brien. If Bwana Devil was advertised with the immortal tagline `A lion in your lap,' then Man in the Dark has a whole department store full of them to choose from - `A scalpel in your cranium! A bullet in your brain! A cigar in your eye! A flowerpot in your face! A budgie in your barnet!' It even embraces the sideshow aspect of the format by setting its nightmare sequence and finale in an amusement park and rollercoaster, with a wondrously silly shootout on a crack-the-whip ride.A loose remake of 1936's The Man Who Lived Twice, the plot's pretty simple: O'Brien's crook volunteers for experimental surgery that will remove his criminal tendencies only to find it removing his memory as well - something which his aggrieved former partners in crime don't believe when they kidnap him to find out where he's hidden the loot from their last job (quite why he'd volunteer for the operation rather than serve out his sentence with $130,000 waiting for him when he gets out is never explained). Being a film noir, the answer lies in a dream scene, but not before moll Audrey Totter has decided she prefers the new and improved O'Brien and Ted De Corsia's thug with a dirty mug and sidekick Nick Dennis, whose striped Zoot suit and bowtie ensemble is a thing of wonder even in 2D, decide they don't. Not to mention there's also Dan Riss' ruthless insurance man on his heels adding to his woes...It's not top tier noir but there's hardboiled dialogue a plenty: ""This guy understands only one language.

"A couple of years before teaming up on The Valachi Papers, Terence Young directed Charles Bronson in this entirely disposable but rather enjoyable Friday nighter from a novel by Richard Matheson (has any writer ever had so many novels and short stories filmed in his own lifetime?). It's nothing special, but surprisingly entertaining if you're in the right mood, and offers the once-in-a-lifetime casting coup of Liv Ullmann playing Bronson's romantic interest. Yes, that's Ingmar Bergman regular Liv Ullmann in a Charles Bronson film. Just to make the casting even more memorable, you also get a bearded James Mason in a beanie sporting an ahtrayjuss Suvvern axescent as the lead villain of the piece, Jean Topart dubbed by Bond regular Robert Rietty and the inevitable Jill Ireland as an annoying rich hippie chick. It's a simple past-catching-up-with-man-trying-to-make-a-fresh-start plot as Mason and his gang of cashiered army gangsters try to force him into ferrying them to a drug drop by threatening his family only for him to turn the tables, but it's made with brisk efficiency, has a couple of neat plot twists and a display of some impressive driving along dangerous mountain roads courtesy of Remy Julienne.There are multiple public domain versions of this title available (and Amazon are confusing the issue by lumping reviews for different issues from different labels together), but the UK PAL DVDs from Cinema Club/2 Entertain and Optimum are the ones to go for, boasting the best transfer in 1.85:1 widescreen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32L542RIII8RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001Z652Q#wasThisHelpful","R32L542RIII8RR","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the days when Charles Bronson was yet to be typecast as cops or vigilantes and was working his way up to stardom in continental thrillers, Rene Clement's Rider in the Rain is an interesting psychological cat-and-mouse thriller that never really scales the heights but is a lot more intriguing that much of the star's more generic output. Marlene Jobert is raped by an intruder she subsequently kills, but out of a sense of shame - and possibly concerns over her jealous husband - disposes of the body rather than reporting it to the police, only for Charles Bronson's American stranger to suddenly start intruding on her life and asking her why she killed him. It soon becomes clear that he's got an agenda of his own that doesn't necessarily involve the police as he threatens, plies her with liquor and brings to the surface memories of her troubled childhood, with the odd reference to Alice in Wonderland (such as Bronson being described as having a Cheshire Cat smile) implying that all may not be as it seems as their relationship gets curiouser and curiouser...A kind of companion piece to the more devious Someone Behind the Door, critics loved it back in 1970, Bronson thought enough of it to try to remake it in 1983 while Jim Morrison was reportedly so taken with it he was inspired to write Riders on the Storm, but it's more decent than great, feeling like it could have benefited from being shorter and tighter than its near two-hour running time. Optimum's UK DVD earns an extra star for including both the English language version and the simultaneously shot French-language version - not a dubbed print (although Bronson is dubbed) but alternate takes, running four minutes longer. There's no additional footage beyond a slightly longer and more detailed end credits sequence, more a case of a slightly different tempo and much better performances from the French and Italian co-stars (Jobert's mother is also allowed to be a bit warmer towards her in the French version). There are no other extras but a decent widescreen print which is infinitely superior to the atrocious UK public domain issue from Orbit Media that had been the only way to see the film for a long time. Both have the same cover image, so be careful you order the Optimum release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFJE4CL6K8OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TJKVTQ#wasThisHelpful","RKFJE4CL6K8OK","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The all but forgotten Showdown at Boot Hill is an okay little B-western that offers an early starring role and his first top billing for Charles Bronson as a bounty hunting US Marshal who faces an unusual dilemma when he gets his man - dead rather than alive - in a small, sleepily corrupt town, but finds himself unable to claim the reward when it turns out he was so popular with the locals that no-one will identify the body. It's a neat spin on the High Noon formula, beginning with the gunfight before the town turns its back on the lawman, though Bronson's no Gary Cooper here: he's in it for the money (so much so that he won't kill anyone without a bounty on them even when they try to kill him), and no sooner has he holstered his gun than he's snapping ""Better have an inquest real quick. Weather like this, he won't keep."" But it's that kind of town, where even the closest thing he has to an ally, John Carradine's barber-cum-doctor-cum-undertaker says of the latter part of his job description ""Nailing the lid down ain't nothin' more than carpentry,"" while a couple of sleepy cowpokes set the dead man's brother on our anti-hero just to liven things up a little.Intriguingly, some of the townsfolk are given good and valid reasons for their resentment and Bronson shows some initiative to identify the corpse, even making an ill-fated attempt to photograph it (slightly ironic since director Gene Fowler Jr would helm three episodes of Bronson's TV series Man with a Camera the following year). Unfortunately the film begins to drag its feet as Bronson starts to fall for plain Jane waitress Fintan Meyler and the real reason for his ornerieness is revealed - he's desperately insecure about his height, something everyone picks up on and taunts him over. From then on it's all a bit of a disappointment as he learns that ""No matter how many men you kill, it ain't gonna make you an inch taller"" en route to a redemptive anti-climax that feels like something out of a 50s anthology TV show.Still, unlike Bronson's some of other early leading roles like the same year's When Hell Broke loose, at least this doesn't look like bad 50s TV even if the plot could have come straight out of an episode of Steve McQueen's Wanted: Dead or Alive. Oscar-nominated editor-briefly-turned-director Gene Fowler Jr. does a good job of marshalling his limited resources and shows a good eye for the black and white Scope frame to add value to the picture, though he seriously miscalculates by cranking up the two quick draws in the film to unintentionally comic effect. Released as the supporting feature to Harry Black and the Tiger, it's the kind of film that isn't strong enough to stand up as a main feature on its own but is a decent enough `inbetween' movie.Olive's Region A-locked Blu-ray release offers a decent 2.35:1 widescreen black and white transfer, though there's nothing they can do about the limitations of the original Regalscope process used to shoot the film, which is a bit hit-and-miss - mostly good, but in some shots one part of the frame might be in softer focus than the rest. No extras.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBQCLV960DSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFHED72#wasThisHelpful","REBQCLV960DSP","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite its low reputation, Burt Kennedy's The Train Robbers has quite a bit going for it even if the end result is a pretty average oater best seen in a double-bill with a better film. John Wayne and old friends Rod Taylor and Ben Johnson (who, true to the formula in later Wayne pictures, handles all the dialogue filling in the Duke's backstory to make sure the audience knows what a great guy he is behind the bluster) team up to help widow Ann-Margret find the quarter of a million in gold her late husband stole so she can turn it in for the reward with a clear conscience. Naturally hubby's former partners in crime and a few more anonymous bad `uns they've recruited in the intervening years have plans of their own and are in hot pursuit.For the two-thirds the plot can roughly be summed up as: Wayne and company ride at a leisurely pace while a band of band men gallop after them without catching up for the best part of an hour of screentime while Ricardo Montalban's silent stranger watches from a distance while smoking a cigar. Thankfully there's some good dialogue along the way that has fun playing with Wayne's many catchphrases while acknowledging the Duke is too old to play the romantic lead (""I've got a saddle older than you, Mrs Lowe""). Along the way we learn that Rod Taylor can't master an American accent, Ann Margret can't play drunk, Dominic Frontiere's busy score can't really get a grip on the film and can surmise that Bobby Vinton managed to annoy someone high up on the film from the way he's literally pretty much sidelined throughout the film - because he's often placed at the extreme edge of the frame and rarely does anything, he was almost completely cut out of Warner Home Video's old fullframe video transfer.The action's decent when it comes in the last half hour and the wrecked train set among the desert sand dunes is a particularly memorable location, but its greatest asset is William Clothier's superb scope photography which ensures it's certainly one of the best looking Westerns of the 70s - the opening sequence of Ben Johnson waiting in a ghost town for a train amid swirling dust may not have the payoff of Once Upon a Time in the West, but it's a great scene setter the film doesn't have much chance of living up to. Still, as Taylor says, ""It's something to do"" even if it is more two-and-a-half stars than three.Warner Home Video's US NTSC DVD has a fine 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with a few decent extras - a vintage making of featurette, a newer featurette on working with Wayne, original theatrical trailer and trailers for Tall in the Saddle, Fort Apache, Blood Alley, The Sea Chase, Cahill - U.S. Marshal and McQ.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTKSEG8TS75K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O59A0C#wasThisHelpful","R2CTKSEG8TS75K","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intended as a major roadshow picture, The Cowboys suffered badly on its original release in 1972 as a hostile press tried to read Wayne's offscreen political views into what was basically an exceptionally good cattle drive Western with a twist. With the twist being that a gold rush causes all Wayne's farm hands to skip the ranch, forcing him to recruit a motley group of schoolboys to take their place. A rites of passage tale, many chose to interpret their ultimately violent coming of age as a right-wing statement on everything from gun ownership to the Vietnam war, but removed from the political fallout of its day it holds up remarkably well as a bittersweet tale of the passing of one generation and the coming of another. It wasn't intended as a requiem for the genre, but it's certainly one of the last great traditional American Westerns.It doesn't hurt that parts of it are staggeringly beautiful, with actor-turned-director Mark Rydell, perhaps the least likely Western helmer of the 70s, showing a remarkable visual sense and a gift for choosing just the right angle and the right lens to get the most out of every visual opportunity. He and cinematographer Robert Surtees also know exactly how to use the Scope frame to its fullest to make the film look genuinely epic without falling just into travelogue prettiness - they give it a real sense of energy when it's needed, as does John Williams superb score, richly drawing on Western tradition but not overlooking the emotion.The cowboys themselves are a particularly good and credible ensemble, but although they ultimately take centre-stage it's the grownups who leave the biggest impression. There's a fine, rich performance from Roscoe Lee Browne, relishing the rich language and largeness of his teller of tall tales and font of quiet wisdom without ever tipping over into complete ham, always knowing when to tone it down and more than a match for Wayne. By contrast, Bruce Dern's villain opts for the kind of performance that at times could almost be written off as bug-eyed ham if not for the fact he seriously does seem to be intensely dangerously crazy for real (as the retrospective making of featurette reveals, he made a point of being almost as intimidating to the boys offscreen as on to help their scenes along). It's no surprise that the part earned him years of hate mail though, as he told Wayne on the set, ""They'll sure love me in Berkeley!""But it's the Duke's film, the star delivering a beautifully subtle performance that manages to tell you everything you need to know without ever spelling it out. His early scenes with Sarah Cunningham as his wife, economically essaying their quietly loving relationship are absolutely convincing - you really believe these two have shared their lives - without seemingly doing much: their performances and body language just a perfect fit. Similarly his early scenes with Slim Pickens have an unspoken familiarity and quiet warmth just by the relaxed and familiar way they hold themselves in each other's company that tells you more than pages of dialogue ever could. Although Rydell originally wanted George C. Scott for the lead it's impossible to imagine any other actor in the part: more than his own considerable reputation in the genre, he brings a remarkable underplayed sensitivity to the role. After the shoot he told Rydell it was his favourite film, and while it was far from the only film he said that of, you can feel a real connection with the part in every frame. It's the kind of quietly towering performance that never overwhelms the film but manages to lift it to another level, and while it may not have got the praise it deserved at the time it's one of the great ones of the 70s.The film was originally cut in the UK - Colleen Dewhurst's entire role as a travelling Madame was removed to get the film a lower rating - but the DVD and Blu-ray are fully restored, even including John Williams' remarkable overture as well as the intermission and entr'acte from the film's US roadshow presentations. The picture quality on the Blu-ray is particularly good,, making the most of the remarkable landscapes, while there's a fine selection of extras (also included on the deluxe edition DVD): the aforementioned half-hour retrospective documentary with Rydell and many of the cowboys as well as Dern and Rydell, an original 1972 making of short, the theatrical trailer and a good audio commentary from an enthusiastic and justifiably proud producer-director. And make no mistake, The Cowboys is certainly a Western to be proud of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDPJRA7LDY0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P6XU60#wasThisHelpful","R1FDPJRA7LDY0R","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Horse Soldiers is usually damned with faint praise as one of John Ford's lesser Westerns, especially compared to his famed cavalry trilogy. It's not hard to understand why: despite the big budget and substantial resources it's more an okay film than a particularly good one, hobbled by a clumsily manufactured central conflict that simply doesn't ring true and a few too many plot turns that go nowhere. John Wayne is the ex-railroad engineer turned Union colonel sent behind Confederate lines to destroy their railroad tracks to disrupt their supply lines, which should be enough for a decent Western, but the film takes an early turn into the desperately contrived by having him take an instant dislike to William Holden's surgeon who has been foisted upon him - not because of a clash of personalities, which might make sense, but because he thinks doctors are charlatans using soldiers to experiment on... You can guess why he has that view long before he drunkenly reveals it, but the only way that it could have generated any real dramatic sparks if is Holden had been the doctor concerned instead of a nice guy who just rubs the Duke up the wrong way.You know they'll eventually learn to respect each other but the scriptwriters can't really build any real drama out of such shaky foundations, and since they're also the producers there's no-one to tell them to go back and think about it some more, reducing Wayne to the usual default by-the-numbers grumpy and obstinate persona of his lesser pictures and Holden an amiable figure more bemused than frustrated by him. So to up the ante a little they have Wayne forced to take Constance Towers and her faithful slave Althea Gibson prisoner after they learn his plans, with the inevitable romance slowly brewing. In fact, much of what happens in The Horse Soldiers takes it's time to brew and it certainly never really comes to the boil. There are some good moments, like the battle at a railway depot, but others, like the threat of having to fight against children from a local military academy, are dodged because everyone just behaves too gallantly for this particular war. (The final battle sequence was also scaled down after the death of stuntman Fred Kennedy in a horse fall.) Still, you do get to see Hank Worden made up to look like Abe Lincoln's cousin and cinematographer William C. Clothier makes it look good, especially when Ford is filling the screen with men and riders, though it doesn't look quite as good as it should on a rather disappointing DVD transfer that's a definite step down from the old laser disc release.There are a few bits of print damage too, while the original captions identifying the locations have been removed and replaced with computer generated ones for the Region 2 DVD, which does at last include a brief trailer as an extra. MGM/UA's region-free Bluray apparently only has a longer trailer as extra with only marginally improved picture quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25LWE079XHYCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TJ1H3W#wasThisHelpful","R25LWE079XHYCM","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the rights pass from distributor to distributor, there have been quite a few issues of the 1939 Stagecoach, from Universal's barebone's UK PAL issue to Warner's NTSC single-disc edition that included trailers for various John Ford films to their more ambitious two-disc edition with a Scott Eyman audio commentary which also included the documentary American Masters - John Ford/John Wayne: The Filmmaker and the Legend, featurette Stagecoach - A Story of Redemption and a vintage radio adaptation. It doesn't help that Amazon have lumped the reviews for all the different editions together, but thus far the best to go far is Criterion's excellent two disc NTSC set (though bear in mind the Bluray edition is Region A locked).Even in 1939 there wasn't anything strikingly original about Stagecoach, but that doesn't stop it being a terrific little picture even if, stylistically, it's a very schizophrenic one. Much of the film, particularly the interior scenes, is very much a 1930s picture, yet once they reach the ferry and the big battle with the Apache kicks in it suddenly becomes a strikingly modern one with far more imaginative and dynamic camerawork than you usually find in Ford's films, making it no surprise that this was the film Greg Toland used to teach Orson Welles about filmmaking, only for the style to suddenly revert almost to the 1920s once it reaches its destination, Lordsburg. Indeed, the scenes with Luke Plummer have a look and feel that could almost have come straight out of a silent western, albeit a moodily photographed one (throughout the picture Bert Glennon's photography opts for darker, deeper blacks than was the norm for the genre) - although Ford ultimately decides to play the dialogue-free scene almost by sound alone. You don't even get to see the final gunfight, Ford cutting away as soon as it begins, preferring tension over action. Yet somehow the grab bag of styles melds surprisingly well and the film is still remarkably entertaining and holds up much better 70 years on than its forgotten remakes.The surprisingly rough looking title sequence, complete with tramline scratching, doesn't bode well for Criterion's much-vaunted improved transfer, but once the film gets started the quality improves massively: it's probably fair to say this is the very best it's ever looked on the small screen, and possibly the best it's looked since it came out. Also included among the copious extras on Criterion's two-disc set (including 72 minutes of unedited footage of a typically difficult Ford interview with Philip Jenkinson) is the restored silent John Ford comedy Bucking Broadway, starring its producer Harry Carey Jr. as a cowhand who follows his fiancé (Molly Malone) to New York when she runs out on him and her Mark Twain lookalike father with a city slicker played by Vester Pegg, the ugliest of the Plummer boys in Stagecoach (the one who couldn't even hit a cat at four paces). Since neither of her beaus is exactly an oil painting, unless it's one of Dorian Grey, she's obviously not got particularly high standards, but the same could be said of whoever decided to back this story. A tiresome affair even at 54 minutes that veers more to maudlin sentimentality over comedy - neither of the two would-be comic setpieces work and there are few attempts to mine the situation for comedy elsewhere - it's probably fair to say that this wasn't funny in 1917 and it certainly isn't funny today. There are a couple of interesting visuals, but it's a long, hard slog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBKAFEOBVEXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00393SG0G#wasThisHelpful","R3RBKAFEOBVEXM","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""My father was a gentleman's gentleman... and his father before him. And from that heritage of service miraculously there comes a man. A person of importance, however small. A man whose decisions and whose future are in his own hands.""Rarely revived and never on UK TV, Leo McCarey's 1935 version of Ruggles of Red Gap was the third to reach the screen in just 17 years, but it's hard to imagine the other versions topping it. It's not a particularly credible plot, with Charlie Ruggles (not actually playing Ruggles despite the film literally having his name on it) `winning' Charles Laughton's reserved and soft-spoken gentleman's gentleman from Roland Young's vaguely lubricated English aristocrat and taking him out West with him, where his socially ambitious wife Mary Boland hopes he'll have a civilising effect on his wardrobe and manners. Naturally the opposite is the case, with the initially quietly horrified Ruggles the butler finding the Land of Opportunity - and widow Zasu Pitts - much to his liking...The comic misunderstandings and mistaken identity shenanigans are pretty much standard issue and the comedy generally more restrained and understated than expected, yet it's such a charming and delightfully good-natured film it's practically impossible not to embrace it. Ruggles the actor has the down home commonsense speak-yer-mind nature to carry off a part that could potentially be irritating thoroughly likeably, while Laughton's quiet, buttoned down performance is a marvel of understated depth, doing so little yet revealing so much. At heart there's not much to the film, but thanks to the increasingly overlooked Leo McCarey's wonderfully restrained direction it's a very pleasing mixture of the accessible sophistication of Ernst Lubitsch and a rather more unfussy take on the populism of Frank Capra that hits all the right spots without hitting the audience over the head in the process.Eureka's UK Region B-locked Blu-ray and DVD combo does the film justice with a very decent transfer, no fewer than three separate radio adaptations with Ruggles and Laughton, and audio recording of Laughton reciting the Gettysburg Address as per one of the film's most popular scenes (one that would get the film banned in Nazi Germany where the government didn't want any of that created equal guff polluting Aryan minds), and a booklet. There's also an interesting 17-minute interview with Laughton's biographer Simon Callow, who draws interesting parallels with the way the actor's own background in the family's hotel business (where Osbert Sitwell described him as looking ""like an actor playing a waiter"") and hatred of the British class system influenced both his approach to the film and his decision to take American citizenship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DR5GZNGQ03Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QP3YC2#wasThisHelpful","R16DR5GZNGQ03Y","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many, Charles Bronson has a reputation as a rather monolithic screen presence that's not entirely undeserved considering how lazy many of his 80s and 90s films were, but in the mid-70s when his star was still riding high he could still challenge people's perceptions with a much more engaged performance in an unexpected gem like From Noon Till Three only to see it ignored by both his action movie fanbase disappointed by the lack of a body count and more upmarket audiences who weren't convinced by the star's presence in a surprisingly sophisticated black comedy romance alike. Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning writer-director Frank D. Gilroy's own novel From Noon Till Three: The Possibly True and Certainly Tragic Story of an Outlaw and a Lady Whose Love Knew No Bounds, it's a shame the film is so little known and so rarely revived.Bronson is (perhaps) a former colonel who has fallen on hard times since the Civil War and is now riding with Douglas Fowley's motley band of outlaws en route to the biggest bank robbery of their lives, but a troubling nightmare that an ambush lies in wait leads him to take advantage of an injury to his horse to sit out the raid at refined widow Jill Ireland's remote mansion. In the three hours that he spends waiting for their return a relationship gradually blossoms as her haughty exterior melts and his own true character emerges only for the law to put an abrupt end to things. Escaping only to be jailed for another man's crimes, he emerges from prison a year later eager to rekindle their romance to find that in the interim she has turned it into an international best-selling novel, play and song, the mansion becoming a shrine for tourists and the story so elaborately over-romanticised that she doesn't recognize the real man anymore - and when she finally does, she doesn't want the unvarnished truth destroying the legend that the whole world has taken to its heart...The film was never going to be an easy sell, shifting from Western to romance to black comedy with a resolution that makes perfect sense but certainly left many enchanted by the love story and hoping for a more Hollywood ending disappointed. The presence of the usually stiff-as-a-board Mrs Bronson in a demanding role probably didn't help any more than the cartoonish Mad Magazine-style posters a desperate studio used to market it. Yet it's a quirky little delight of a movie that has fun subverting expectations, not least of its leading man. Bronson is quite the revelation here, clearly having a ball in the kind of part that Burt Lancaster would have played only a few years earlier, delivering writer-director Gilroy's occasionally elegant dialogue as if it were second nature and taking advantage of the script's ample opportunities to show a range that was rarely asked of him as he's forced to adopt multiple disguises and identities in the second half of the film as he finds himself cast out of his own legend even by his former friends. While Ireland isn't as effortlessly natural, that works in her favour in the early scenes and she certainly ups her usual game this time round and has moments where she's refreshingly natural and unforced, possibly because it's one of the few times in her husband's films that she was working with a director who actually wanted her in his film. The two really do light up in some of their scenes together for the only time in their 18 films together.There's also an excellent score from Elmer Bernstein: more a gentle wistful romantic one than a boots and saddles one, with a particularly beautiful love theme, Hello and Goodbye, that even Jill Ireland's vocal rendition can't ruin, it's closer to his work on 'smaller' films like To Kill a Mockingbird than his more robust scores, and just as effective in its own way. (Bernstein and co-lyricist Alan Bergman even cameo in the film as a pair of song pluggers.)After all but vanishing for years aside from a less than impressive Spanish DVD, the film has re-emerged on VOD (it never got a US DVD release), though the German Blu-ray and DVD releases are a much better bet, boasting a cleaned up widescreen transfer, original trailer and stills gallery as extras. It's not quite a classic, but it is something of a charmer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KLH3PUW0OTNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063NT8S8#wasThisHelpful","R1KLH3PUW0OTNC","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although both have previously been released on DVD in the US separately by Anchor Bay, Shout Factory's Region 1 NTSC DVD offers a decent value for money double-bill.Having made his elegiac and wistful look at the dying days of one legendary outlaw a few years earlier with Robin and Marion, Richard Lester ended the seventies with an amiable look at the beginning of another pair of outlaws' career in the engaging and surprisingly entertaining Butch and Sundance: The Early Days. Lester may have regarded the film as a `Victorian adventure' rather than a Western, but don't let that fool you: it's an entertaining though highly episodic oater that celebrates the outlaw of movie folklore with its tongue not too far in its cheek rather than grimly deconstructing the myth as was the fashion in the late 70s. It only offers a few hints that time already is running out in the form of Joe Lefors' lawman, introduced with a shot of his iconic straw hat but here just another sheriff leading an easily discouraged posse rather than the relentless nemesis of the George Roy Hill film, and our two heroes are in their prime rather than living on borrowed time. Here one of the biggest problems they face is coming up with a suitable outlaw name for Henry Longabough and creating the right kind of legend to ensure their popularity.Tom Berenger and William Katt may not be another Paul Newman and Robert Redford but they do a fair approximation of what their Butch and Sundance could have been like when they first teamed up. Katt in particular has Redford's Sundance Kid mannerisms and delivery down to a fine art and there are some great faces in the supporting cast - Brian Dennehy John Schuck, Vincent Schiavelli, Christopher Lloyd, Elya Baskin - and yes, that is the director as startled onlooker in the hearse scene. The film sags a bit in the middle where a bullet wound leads to a period of going straight that gets in the way of the fun, but elsewhere the stars are likeable, the robberies are funny and often ingenious with an enjoyable train robbery finale, the script often witty and there's fine photography by Laszlo Kovacs, convincing production design from Brian Eatwell and a nice Patrick Williams score. A flop in its day, it now stands as Lester's last entirely satisfactory film before the confused mess of Cuba and his lucrative Superman sendups ended his creatively winning streak that held for most of the 70s.Teaming up Dirty Dozen alumni Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin as the `Mad Trapper' Albert Johnson and the Mountie on his trail in the wastes of the Yukon, Death Hunt is a decent rather than great manhunt movie from the appropriately named Peter Hunt, who puts his experience of shooting on ice from OHMSS to good use. Very loosely based on the biggest manhunt in Canada's history, Bronson's reclusive loner gets on the wrong side of Ed Lauter and his assorted yahoos when he forces him to sell his injured fighting dog. Things escalate, dead bodies accumulate and after a failed siege of his log cabin leaves him on the run across the Rocky Mountains, the whole thing blows up into a media circus as various desperate types try to claim the $1000 reward on his head while Marvin tries to bring him back alive. With its protagonist who just wants to be left alone hunted by a professional who respects him while the mob is baying for a piece of his flesh, in some ways it can be seen as a 1930s-set First Blood, which it beat to the screen by a year, though it's less over the top and has less action than you might expect (it's not until the last third that the manhunt really starts). It's the most polished and well crafted of Bronson's 80s films, benefiting from a decent budget and supporting cast, Carl Weathers, Maury Chaykin and William Sanderson among them, though Angie Dickinson, reunited with her Point Blank co-star, is wasted in a nothing part as a prospector's widow whose sole purpose in the film seems to be to lower the testosterone level and add a bit more star power. If it never quite hits the highs, both stars are on good form and it works well enough as a Saturday Nighter to forgive the many huge liberties it takes with the facts.Both films are in their original 1.85:1 ratios with only their respective trailers as extras. Print quality is decent but not outstanding, with Death Hunt clearly superior to Cornerstone/Palladium's UK DVD release, which is a standards conversion from NTSC to PAL, which means a softer picture and occasional blurring that's inferior to the US and German releases. Fans of Death Hunt might want to look out for the German PAL DVD and Blu-ray releases (released as Yukon but carrying the US title on the film itself), which goes rather better on the extras front with with a radio broadcast of the film's press conference with the stars, with Lee Marvin on dryly amusing form as he takes over the MC's duties because Judith Crist got stuck in traffic!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UX9FWLCTAB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AZ7ZKY#wasThisHelpful","R3UX9FWLCTAB3","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it's not difficult to tell when a studio doesn't have much confidence in a film. Changing the title several times is usually one, and Robert Aldrich's kosher comedy Western went from The Ten Gallon Yamulka and No Knife to The Frisco Kid. The trailer's another dead giveaway: most of it is made up of footage of Gene Wilder from Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Silver Streak. Nor did it get much of a theatrical release and has kept a low profile on TV and video ever since (it's practically been unseen in the UK since 1980) despite co-starring Gene Wilder and a young Harrison Ford, still fresh off Star Wars, as a naive Polish rabbi headed to San Francisco and the outlaw he teams up with. It doesn't help that the film was at one point a John Wayne vehicle until they tried to get him to take a pay cut, especially since Ford lacked the star power at that time to fill his boots, as Aldrich went to enormous lengths to remind him (Aldrich was a great believer in humiliating a performance out of comparatively inexperienced actors). Yet despite having so much going against it, it's not bad at all even if it is one of those comedies that's more amiable rather than hilarious, surprisingly avoiding the temptation to get cheap laughs from religion while still playing on the inevitable culture clashes that arise along the way. There are some nice spins on the odd cliché, be it the difficulty in raising a posse from townsfolk who don't have money in the bank or the problems of going on the run on the Sabbath, some good support from Val Bisoglio's chief and William Smith's bad guy and just enough jokes to carry it over the slow patches even if few of them are exactly new.Warner's Region 1 DVD has a decent widescreen transfer but only a brief teaser trailer as extra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OPK108UZ1R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BYA4J2#wasThisHelpful","R15OPK108UZ1R1","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rustlers' Rhapsody was one of those films that had the misfortune to be made for a cinema audience that no longer existed: not only was it a comedy Western in 1985, the spoof landscape having moved on a long way since Blazing Saddles barely over a decade earlier, but it was a gentle and affectionate comedy Western parodying 30s and 40s matinee B movies that were no longer even playing on TV, so a fair portion of the small audience that might have been lured in by Police Academy director Hugh Wilson's name probably didn't get the joke. But if you are well versed in Western lore and can give it a reel or two to find its feet after an unsteady start, it's really rather delightful. Tom Berenger is singing cowboy Rex O'Herlihan, drifting into yet another stereotypical Western town where they complain if there isn't a hair in the gin and where another power mad cattle baron (Andy Griffith) with thousands of cattle you hear but never see is at war with the local sheep herders who smell awful and rely on passing strangers who only ever shoot the bad guys in the hand to fight their battles for them. Even Rex is aware of how predictable it is, filling in G.W. Bailey's town drunk and future sidekick in on the town characters rather than vice versa while town hostess Marilu Henner and the villain's daughter Sela Ward vie for his affections and Griffith allies his traditional cowboys with railroad boss Fernando Rey's spaghetti Western bad guys who wear long raincoats even when it's 110degrees and who have better theme music than the good guys. (Leone fans will certainly recognise some of the Almeria locations.)Despite numbering Walter Hill among its producers, this is a world away from Deadwood, though it has fun with the characters' sexuality and undermines many of the absurd Code of the West rules the films it spoofs were built on. Griffith is terrific as the chief villain constantly frustrated by the inability of his minions to understand him, Bailey gives good sidekick, Jim Carter has a nice but all too brief cameo as a vicious gunfighter and Patrick Wayne has fun as a rival good guy who throws him into existential crisis by undermining his belief in his own goodness and his own heterosexuality. It's a lot of fun despite the complete absence of any rustlers, but unfortunately the DVD release is missing one scene where Rex resolve his confident heterosexuality issues as well as being devoid of any extras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYQ7DUW6KDLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001JXPW0#wasThisHelpful","R1WYQ7DUW6KDLR","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After four French animated features, a couple of not well regarded Terence Hill live-action films and the odd TV series, James Huth's big budget 2009 version of Morris and Goscinny's popular comic book series Lucky Luke doesn't do much to improve the cinematic batting average of the cowboy hero who's so fast he can outdraw his own shadow. Despite seeming perfect casting, an unfocused script renders Jean Dujardin rather hit and miss as the clean cut Wild West idol of millions who never killed a man only to suffer a crisis of conscience after doing just that when he's tasked by the President to clean up his outlaw-infested home town and finds himself confronted with one of the men who killed his parents. A big part of the problem is that, while there's style to spare - imagine a cross between a Jeunet and Caro film and a brightly lit spaghetti western filmed in the kind of Western town that might have been built by the architects of Robert Altman's Popeye - it's not particularly funny and there's not much of a sense of fun either. True, there are a few effective sight gags here and there and it manages to feel like a convincingly live-action version of a cartoon, but the film's occasional bold colour shifts and dramatic lighting changes tend to make more of an impression than the jokes.It doesn't help that the overpopulated supporting characters aren't ever really given enough comic ammunition, be it Michael Youn's lollipop licking Billy the Kid or Melvil Popaud's Shakespeare-quoting theatrical ham Jesse James, while the film really doesn't know what to do with Sylvie Testud's Calamity Jane once it's taken the trouble to introduce her. The film also tends to amble until its surprisingly effective final showdown in a giant Las Vegas one-armed bandit-cum-funhouse, though it does provide a few injokes for the fans of the books - Luke's childhood sketch is one of the earliest Lucky Luke cartoons and there's a neat post-credits gag about the decision to remove the character's once trademark cigarette in 1983. There's enough that does work to keep you watching and it's certainly better than its reputation, but it's a definite case of great poster, shame about the film.UGC's French Blu-ray offers a stunning 2.35:1 transfer that shows off the spectacular Argentinean locations very impressively, though the English subtitles are limited to the feature itself and sadly don't translate the onscreen gags punctuating the end credits. Unsubtitled extras are limited to a director's commentary, gag reel, featurette on special effects and lengthy 32-minute selection of stills from the Argentine location with director's commentary. Just be warned that the pressing seems rather temperamental when it comes to loading. The film is also available on an extras-free PAL DVD in the UK.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25X420FGX3UAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UNMHUQ#wasThisHelpful","R25X420FGX3UAN","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before The Day of the Jackal there was The Tall Target, which saw John Kennedy (no, not that one) trying to foil an assassination attempt on Abraham Lincoln's life before his inauguration. Like De Gaulle, we know that this particular plot won't succeed, but we don't know how the plot will unravel and the film more than compensates for the lack of suspense over the President's fate with suspense over whether Dick Powell' secret service man who no-one believes will make it to the end of the line on a train filled with plenty of suspects and more than one killer.Like a 19th Century Narrow Margin, Anthony Mann's taut thriller straddles his transition from film noir to Westerns even more pronouncedly than his earlier Border Incident, with Paul C. Vogel's deep black and white photography standing in very effectively for John Alton. The script is sharp, as filled with character as it is with twists and turns, even finding room for a great supporting performance from Ruby Dee in a role that could easily have been a throwaway stereotype. A terrific little thriller that hits the ground running and keeps you hooked all the way to the final twist.Only available as a manufactured on demand DVD-R from Warners' Archive series in the US, the transfer is pretty good though clearly not remastered, and also includes the original theatrical trailer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EKNS52CN846/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG8PZO#wasThisHelpful","R29EKNS52CN846","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Where are the rest of you?""""We're all gone.""Only available in the US in a manufactured on demand DVD-R, Devil's Doorway is easily the least seen of all of Anthony Mann's Westerns - not surprisingly, since it's also the darkest by far, the extraordinary The Naked Spur included. All the hallmarks of his later classics are there, but without any commercial compromise. In most of Mann's westerns, the hero is redeemed kicking and screaming in spite of himself. In Devil's Doorway alone it is not the hero who is in need of redemption, but the country, an idea he wouldn't return to until 1964's The Fall of the Roman Empire. You know that there is no way this one is going to have a happy ending: against all expectations for major studio fare of its day, it doesn't.It constantly goes against the grain, even the casting playing against expectations, with a monumentally miscast Robert Taylor, replete with none-too-convincing make-up as the Native American hero, gradually managing to shrug off his matinee idol image to turn in his best screen performance - headstrong, angry and surprisingly impassioned - in a role that must have been surprisingly relevant when the film was shot only four years after the end of WW2. Like many GIs returning from the war (be it WW2 or Korea), his character has spent the past few years fighting for the American dream in the Civil War only to find out that he's not eligible, in his case by virtue of his color. The notion of a truly United States that he fought for, a utopia where people ""didn't die for nothing,"" proves a lie. The sense of post-war disillusionment that fuelled the film noir genre constantly drives both the story and the remarkable visual style of the film in ways almost unique in the genre.In a curious but highly effective inversion of traditional lighting techniques, in the night scenes the foregrounds and interiors are darkly lit, rendering the players silhouettes, while the valley that dominates the action is clearly visible. The film noir connections go beyond John Alton's lighting. Like the traditional noir hero, Taylor finds that nothing he does can avert the deepening nightmare that ultimately destroys him. He tries to act within the law, but finds himself frustrated by it at every turn. Despite fighting for the United States and earning a Congressional Medal, he finds that in the eyes of the law he is not even an American citizen. It is illegal for him to homestead his own land. It is illegal for him to buy it back from homesteaders. Even a petition from the few sympathetic townspeople is dismissed out of hand.Yet surprisingly, instead of reducing his plight to black and white moral issues, Guy Trosper's screenplay deals in shades of grey. The sheep men who persecute him are not the caricatures you might expect - their problems are just as pressing as his. Nor is the racial prejudice overdone or driven home with sledgehammer pontificating: the hate is there, so ingrained that it doesn't need to be emphasised. Even Louis Calhern's tormenter-in-chief regards hating `redskins' as such a natural thing that he never descends into overstated melodramatic villainy, the actor responding with a skilled performance that makes him all the more immoveable and unyielding for being the human incarnation of the way things have always been. Mann underplays his `comeuppance,' placing it well before the film's finale (remarkably similar to the pitched battle at the end of Cimino's `Heaven's Gate) and its tragic conclusion. It is inevitable, unsatisfying and ultimately resolves nothing. Like everything else Lance does on both sides of the law, it is totally futile. From the moment he returns, he has no control over his fate.There is no doubt that the film would never have been made without the influence of Dore Schary, the liberal at King Louis' court at MGM, but with this and his later, bitterly disillusioned Men in War, it is surprising that Mann did not come under the kind of unwelcome scrutiny by the HUAC enjoyed by many of his contemporaries. Perhaps it was because even when it came out it was so under the radar that, in many ways, it missed the boat. A nervous MGM shelved it until the later, and lighter Broken Arrow was released and took all the critical and box-office laurels and gave audiences a more hopeful ending than the still shockingly stark and bitter one Mann delivers in a remarkably uncompromising film that was decades ahead of its time. Incredibly powerful, it deserves to be so much better known.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303FK8I1QX3LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XTL54K#wasThisHelpful","R303FK8I1QX3LK","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to know which tagline is the more misleading - `Pages torn from the diary of a frontier dance hall girl!' or `The stars of The Parent Trap trapped together again by their past,' but both serve warning that Sam Peckinpah's first feature The Deadly Companions aka Trigger Happy is not one of his finer hour-and-a-halfs. Opportunistically thrown together on the cheap by Maureen O'Hara's brother to capitalise on the success of her teaming with Brian Keith in The Parent Trap, it's not an unpromising idea but it is one that rarely comes to life thanks to a poor script, one note performances and the kind of production where finishing on time and under budget was more important than making it good. Peckinpah was Keith's choice of director (they had struck up a friendship on the TV series The Westerner), which apparently didn't go down too well with his producer or leading lady. Peckinpah wasn't the easiest director to work with if you weren't on his wavelength but reputedly banned from even talking to O'Hara on the set, let alone directing her, his suggestions for rewrites ignored and barely tolerated by his the ever-watchful producer who promptly re-edited the ending, it may be some sort of achievement that he delivered a fairly competent job, but it's a defiantly dull movie with few hints that Peckinpah had the stuff of greatness in him. It really could have been turned out by almost any capable Western hack and would be almost completely forgotten were it not for his later notoriety.Keith is the Yankee drifter who saves Chill Wills' lowlife from an impromptu lynching for cheating at cards and persuades him and flashy partner Steve Cochran to come with him to a small town with a new bank and an old sheriff. Not that robbery's what he's really got on his mind: he wants his revenge on the Reb who tried to scalp him during the war. Unfortunately they get beaten to the bank by another gang, and even more unfortunately a war wound that prevents him from holding his gun arm properly causes Keith to accidentally kill dance hall girl and town pariah Maureen O'Hara's son. To make amends he sets out to accompany her and the boy's body to the ghost town to bury her son next to the husband none of the town gossips believe she had, initially accompanied by the two and later pursued by a vengeful Apache, but she wants none of it. And, for most of the running time, chances are neither will you because, despite the odd quirk like a town that can't agree what day of the week it is or Wills' mad Reb deserter who wants to use the money from a bank robbery to create his own republic complete with an army of Indian slaves, there's not a lot going on and most of it not happening very interestingly. You do get to see Strother Martin turn up as the first of Peckinpah's preachers, Wills looks appropriately serpentlike when draped around the branch of a tree leering at O'Hara and there's a nicely cynical payoff with the townsfolk demonstrating what they truly value enough to head into Apache territory, but it's a bloodless affair - the re-editing even ensures that one of the characters never kills anyone when originally he shot someone out of pure impatience.If anything a bigger problem than the re-editing is the truly atrocious score by Marlin Skiles, which alternates between sounding like something written for a childrens' puppet show or the kind of amateurish library music lazily plastered over cheap video releases of silent movies. More than merely bad, it's insistently bad, rarely content to let the film play out in silence and constantly undermining what's on screen with an almost wall-to-wall carpeting of just plain wrong.As if that weren't bad enough, the film has been plagued by dismal public domain copies that have littered the DVD market, most panned-and-scanned. Even Optimum's licensed UK DVD is cropped to 1.66:1. The Roan Group's 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is currently the best of the bunch Stateside, but many copies have been plagued with pressing faults and there's not much in the way of extras. Peckinpah completists with multi-region machines are better off going for Koch's PAL German DVD (currently going cheap on Amazon.de) features a restored 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, a lengthy extract from the documentary Passion and Poetry - The Ballad of Sam Peckinpah and an interesting stills gallery for the film (there's one particularly strikingly misleading video cover selling it as a spaghetti western!), although the audio commentary is only unsubtitled German. It's still a poor film that's easily the director's worst, but for the Peckinpah fan it's by far and away the only version to get.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0BWMIAFKOWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALY1ARM#wasThisHelpful","R2E0BWMIAFKOWA","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You Can't Win `Em All aka Soldiers of Fortune comes from the time when the studios were looking ever further East to save money while still getting some spectacle for their buck. With Spain and Italy increasingly expensive and the Soviet Union a bureaucratic nightmare, Turkey must have seemed like a good idea at the time for this riff on Vera Cruz that plants Charles Bronson's mercenary and Tony Curtis not-entirely-disillusioned adventurer (""I lost everything in a big war, maybe I can get some of it back in a small one"") in the dying days of the Ottoman Empire and working for the wrong side ostensibly escorting Turkish Bey Gregoire Aslan's daughters and a shipment of gold to safety. Naturally things aren't that simple and with everyone out for themselves they have as much to worry about from their `allies' - Fikret Hakan's colonel and Michele Mercier's mystery woman - as the rebels. There are few surprises and leading men aside it's short on starpower (fourth-billed Patrick Magee is hardly in the film for as many minutes), but director Peter Collinson delivers the action efficiently enough and at times the film looks like one of the more spectacular spaghetti westerns even if the film never really rises above the level of an acceptable second feature on the wrong half of a double-bill.Sadly the PAL DVD currently available is a Spanish release of dubious origin which, while 2.35:1 widescreen, isn't a great transfer, but it does have an English soundtrack and is currently the only version available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYBOD08WML04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ECLFUY#wasThisHelpful","R1GYBOD08WML04","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You make sounds like you're a mean little ass-kicker, only I ain't convinced. You keep talking and I'm gonna take your head off.""Despite finding success in Europe, Charles Bronson still hadn't made it really big in the US in 1974, so Mr. Majestyk was marketed less on his name than on the promise of Richard Fleischer's film being another Billy Jack or Walking Tall, but the film was part of a one-two whammy with Death Wish, released only a week later, that finally propelled him to superstar status Stateside. Bronson may have managed to antagonise his director and crew so much that, according to Fleischer, they would barely talk to him after the first day's shooting but it's the perfect star vehicle for him as the kind of guy who keeps himself to himself until he's pushed too far. Elmore Leonard's script casts him as a melon farmer who manages to get on the wrong side of both Paul Koslo's small-time local hood who tries to cut in on his business and Al Lettieri's hitman with a seriously bad temper, with the police all too happy to use him as live bait and regarding the possibility of him getting killed as a bit of a bonus. All Bronson wants to do is get in his melon crop before his farm goes under, but with Lettieri and co. scaring off or crippling his workers and shooting up his crop it's only a matter of time before a melon farmer's gotta do what a melon farmer's gotta do...Leonard cut his teeth on westerns, and this is very much a well-crafted modern western crossover to his now more recognised thriller work, but it knows its audience and their expectations perfectly and delivers the kind of decent-guy-fighting-back-after-being-pushed-too-far action movies that moviegoers in the 70s just lapped up, and it holds up remarkably well today. Fleischer had already delivered one minor classic thriller down on the farm with 1955's Violent Saturday and here his more than capable direction displays the kind of invisible professionalism that raises the film above its B-movie potential without drawing too much attention to itself while still making the most of the big setpieces like the botched attempt to rescue Lettieri in transit that drives much of the plot and the celebrated machine-gunning of the hero's melon crop sequence that sets the stage for the real violence to come. Bronson's on good form, with Lettieri a particularly threatening bull in a china shop and Paul Koslo giving good weasel as the lowlife with ideas above his abilities who sets the ball rolling. All in all perfectly satisfying Saturday night action fare.MGM/UA's 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen DVD is for the most part a decent transfer, though it has trouble with a few of the darker shots.

"The Eiger Sanction is one of those films with a high enough concept and a big enough star not to need to have a good script, which is lucky because despite the efforts of no fewer than three writers the script is not very good at all, and seems to know it. Clint Eastwood is a somewhat unlikely mountain-climbing art professor: we know this because he's introduced standing next to a big sign saying he's an art professor while enamoured students swoon over pictures of him mountain climbing. Luckily for the film he's a somewhat more likely retired assassin working for Thayer David's total albino: we know he's a total albino because he tells us. David and Eastwood don't get on, which is strange, because David's office is perpetually in the kind of near total darkness that Eastwood the director loves. Maybe he just doesn't like people who impersonate Bond villains. He doesn't want to go back in business either, but David threatens him not only with an audit of his stolen art collection but also to auction them off to the public, something which horrifies art snob Eastwood into agreeing to kill an unknown man with an occasional limp who just happens to be part of a team led by old pal George Kennedy attempting to climb the Eiger. Only his target obviously knows that one of the party is out to kill him and his fellow climbers start to meet accidents...Yes, it's a very silly film - silly enough for Eastwood to camp it up as a gay delivery man in one scene, Jack Cassidy to play a gay turncoat with a horny dog called Faggit with a thing for Clint's leg and for our antihero to beat up one of the stars of Plan 9 From Outer Space - but as the author of the novel, Travanian (Rod Whitaker) pointed out, worse than just being vapid it also led to the death of one of the climbers involved in the shoot, David Knowles. His accidental death early in shooting on the Eiger itself does unfortunately take some of the sheen off the film's most impressive aspect, the unfaked climbing sequences with Eastwood not only doing almost all of his own stunts on the North Face of the Eiger itself and on the 'Totem Pole Rock' in Monument Valley rather than on a friendlier slope or on studio sets with dodgy back-projection but also directing the film as well. And spare a thought for the poor camera crew, having to take the same risks with the added burden of lugging up and operating camera equipment as well. The film improves considerably as it goes along, though the first half is more of a politically incorrect guilty pleasure, but the spectacular mountain sequences are gripping enough to be worthy of a better film.Unfortunately the DVD, one of the earliest releases on the format, is pretty low quality: the dark scenes are darker than even Eastwood intended there's a lack of detail and a lot of clumsy edge enhancement: it's such a poor transfer with so little effort put into it you half expect it to be panned-and-scanned fullframe, but it is 2.35:1 widescreen with the original trailer as extra, which is something at least.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GG21MV5HM95Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0783230346#wasThisHelpful","R2GG21MV5HM95Q","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Arnold Fanck's 1933 S.O.S. Eisberg (aka S.O.S. Iceberg) may offer a change of location and a tighter running time, it still has many of the problems of his popular German mountain films: a thin plot, a repetitive narrative and an almost complete absence of characterisation. Luckily it still has the same strength, Fanck's remarkable eye for spectacular and inaccessible locations, here the ice floes of Greenland where a rescue expedition finds itself trapped on an iceberg drifting out to sea and their would-be rescuer, Leni Riefenstahl's pilot (and wife of one of the lost explorers) find herself trapped with them after a crash. Once she gets there she really has nothing to do except wait in a cave or strike the odd forlorn pose against the scenery, but unlike The White Hell of Pitz Palu the characters here are at least actively trying to save themselves rather than just waiting to be rescued, and the lengthy scenes of them jumping across the pack ice are often breathtaking, with one sequence where Sepp Rist finds himself stuck on a small crop of rock as a storm brews up around him especially impressive. For the most part the location footage is seamlessly mixed with studio footage, especially some of the polar bear scenes that behind the scenes photographs reveal were shot in a studio tank. There's also some impressive editing, both in the increasingly frenetic cutting as the lost expedition finally makes radio contact with the outside world and the exuberant sequence of Inuits coming to the rescue. You also get to see Walter Riml playing one of the less lucky members of the expedition just a couple of years before he gave up acting and became Riefenstahl's cinematographer on Triumph of the Will.Fanck never quite develops the drama as well as he could, and things suddenly get very crazy towards the end as one man falls prey to a bear while two others fight to the death, and it's never explained why real-life fighter ace and future Luftwaffe bigwig and Goering scapegoat Ernst Udet, playing himself as usual in Fanck's films, suddenly comes to the rescue after we've been told all rescue attempts have been called off and all ships sent back. Luckily despite being lazy with the details it's still got enough of a narrative spine to hold up for an hour-and-a-half even if it is more of an excuse to awe audiences with the landscapes than draw them into a story. Shame about the dog, though, but he at least fares rather better in the simultaneously filmed American version directed by Tay Garnett, which replaced Gustav Diessl with Rod LaRoque and kept the supporting cast and same general storyline but made some significant changes. One of a series of US-German co-productions with Universal that ended when the Nazis came to power, it's included on Kino's Region 1 DVD, and it's an interesting comparison that works well in its own right.The first 25 minutes of the film are almost completely different. Rather than a rescue mission, the five main explorers are all part of the same expedition, itself in search of the records of the real-life ill-fated Wegener expedition three years earlier. Where Fanck (credited here as `Expeditionary Leader') was content to find his drama in the arduous physical nature of the expedition and the grandeur of the land and seascape, Garnett is more of a storyteller, focussing on the character conflict and constantly emphasising the danger of the unstable iceberg overturning. LaRoque isn't the most likeable or responsible of expedition leaders, accusing his comrades of cowardice before going off on his own and needing to be rescued, while Greed's Gilbert Gowland, just another member of the expedition in the German version, here is its cowardly and increasingly unstable backer who dominates much of the drama in his absence. Sepp Rist remains the hero of the tale despite being dubbed like other German cast members, but Riefenstahl has even less to do in the American version than the German one, having little more than a bit part until the much more spectacular finale. Where Fanck was content to end with a joyfully kinetic sequence of Inuits kayaking to the iceberg, Garnett intercuts what's left of the footage with Riefenstahl and LaRoque trying to escape from the exploding iceberg before it sinks and takes them with it.It's not the only change to the chronology or the plot: one character meets his end much sooner in the American version, most of the lengthy flying scenes have been heavily trimmed along with Udet's already brief role and the second plane crash is entirely missing (while the first is curiously flipped in the negative). Most make sense on a dramatic level even if the film never much rises above the level of an average Hollywood drama with decent production values, but what's missed the most is the sheer spectacle than Fanck's version had. Rather than (occasionally gratuitously) showcasing the hostile environment and emphasising the epic duel between man and nature, the US version uses only what is necessary to move the story forwards, and doesn't always use the most impressive footage, though it does add a lengthy section of travelling to the ice floe that sees them losing their dogs and most of their supplies down a crevasse. The fact that there's surprisingly little shared footage at times turns them into very different films despite the shared cast members and general plot. Of the two Fanck's is the better, but the American version is far from negligible even if it is much more of a melodrama, and thankfully Kino's Region 1 DVD contains both versions in very decent prints.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C97AG7Q3SQBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B837WE#wasThisHelpful","R3C97AG7Q3SQBT","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long before she was Hitler's favorite film director, Leni Riefenstahl was German silent cinema's sweetheart and the queen of the mountain movies, and looking at the remarkable The White Hell of Pitz Palu it's not hard to see why: easy on the eye and an expressive and appealing actress, if you absolutely had to be stuck up a mountain with someone she's the kind of person who would be on your list. The film itself is so astonishingly visually striking and engrossing that it's hard to believe it's so largely forgotten: you're more likely to see the amazingly vivid mountain sequences turning up as stock footage (most notably in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe) than you are to see this crop up on the revival circuit or on TV, so Kino's 134-minute DVD of the 1998 German restoration is particularly welcome.The father of the mountain movie, main director Arnold Fanck (who shot the location exteriors while G.W. Pabst did the studio interiors) has a remarkable feeling for the changing face and nature of the title character, the mountain itself, able to shift from joyous beauty to menace in a matter of seconds. The shifts of light, the effect of the wind, the changes in temperature are as expressive as any actor's performance, creating a real adversary for its engaged couple who get lost and have to fight it for survival. The prologue sets the tone perfectly, as another couple's cocky confidence turns to tragedy, the slowly melting icicles driving the survivor mad as he waits for help, the film mirroring it minutes later as another icicle hanging from a mountain hut drips onto Riefenstahl's hand as she lies in the sun blissfully unaware of the danger it is foreshadowing. There's joy too, particularly in a remarkably vivid sequence of a plane flying around their hut in an energetic display of daring acrobatics that makes Sepp Allgeier's camerawork almost take flight itself.(The pilot is played by WW1's second most successful flying ace Ernst Udet who, like Reifenstahl, would have his career destroyed by his association with Hitler - in his case with rather more finality. Having been instrumental in building up the Luftwaffe, political infighting and domestic problems drove him to alcoholism and a mental breakdown and his suicide in 1941 after Goring used him as a scapegoat for losing the Battle of Britain).Unfortunately, after the dramatic entrance of `the Ghost of the Mountain,' the surviving lover who haunts the slopes looking for the frozen body of his bride, the film starts to lose its grip and only intermittently regains it. It's small wonder US distributors Universal cut the film down to 79 minutes from its original 150-minute reported running time: even in this not-quite-complete restoration it's 50 minutes before they start their ill-fated climb, the husband-to-be driven to accompany the `Ghost' by what one suspects is some Pabst-inspired jealousy over Leni's romantic awe for the bereaved climber's morbid romantic quest.The influence on Fred Zinnemann's final film, Five Days One Summer - which also revolves around the frozen corpse of a lost love and the possibility of tragedy repeating itself - is clear, but, perhaps unsurprising considering his reputation for sadistically putting his cast in real harm's way, Fanck is less successful when it comes to drawing us into these people's story. He's obviously more interested in the mountain than his characters or the plot, both of which are thinly sketched out to avoid eating up screen time that could be better spent on more shots of the mountain, gradually eroding their effectiveness. It doesn't help that once disaster strikes and its trio are trapped on a mountain ledge the sum total of their efforts to escape are waving a flag and, at night, an oil lamp while waiting for someone to rescue them or that there's no real interaction between them as their hopes fade. As a result, when one of them does rather pointlessly make the ultimate sacrifice it all seems rather arbitrary and academic since we're so uninvolved in their fate.What carries the film are the set pieces, particularly a visually stunning night sequence where the villagers make their way up the mountain and into a crevice and ice cave to recover the dead bodies of a group of climbers by torchlight in a remarkable chiaroscuro play of light and shadow that's worth the price of admission on its own. From the captions it's clear that the ice cave sequence was originally given a red tint to turn it into a diabolical inferno, but the restored print on Kino's DVD has no tints (not a major problem: the film looks fine in black and white), which isn't the only change from the original version that might disparage some purists. Kino's version also replaces the German intertitles with English ones, though these are presented in the style of the German version, while the various notes and letters have burned in subtitle translations. Nonetheless, the restoration feels like its treated the film with respect, and Ashley Irwin's new score is particularly impressive, adopting a bolero motif for the climbing sequences and the ever faithful Dies Iraes for the mountain in threatening mood.Kino's DVD also includes the last TV interview with Leni Reifenstahl, a substantial 52-minutes with the surprisingly sprightly 100-year old that skirts around most of the major issues, as well as a stills gallery and an intriguing extract from the abridged German talkie reissue version that, unusually, dubbed the characters dialogue in such perfect synchronization you could be forgiven for thinking it had been shot with sound.Its pacing and story problems alone ensure that The White Hell of Pitz Palu isn't the deathless classic of lore, but it still impresses despite its faults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIDFD5JP422O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B837X8#wasThisHelpful","RIDFD5JP422O6","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnold Fanck's once hugely popular `berg' (mountain) films have suffered a lot of historical revisionism because of the later Nazi associations of many of those involved - not only Leni Riefenstahl and future Luftwaffe bigwig Ernst Udet but even Fanck himself, although he may only have joined the Party to be allowed to continue making films. While the films themselves had an obvious appeal to some of the strength through health and mythical attitudes of the Nazi party with their emphasis on the physical in their epic tales of man versus nature, there's no political content, just old-fashioned melodrama set against an epic stage: location pictures in every sense of the word where what people do is more important than what they stand for. You get the feeling that he was more like King Kong's Carl Denham, constantly testing himself on dangerous locations only to be nagged into adding romantic interest for the sake of the box-office. 1930's Storm Over Mont Blanc, his first talkie, is a perfect example.There's not much in the way of plot en route to its memorable finale, but it moves a lot faster than Fanck's more famous mountain rescue epic The White Hell of Pitz Palu, throwing in a playful ski chase and a flight to the mountaintop weather station that allows Riefenstahl to meet cute with Sepp Rist's weather man she knows only from his Morse code reports. Their growing romance is briefly postponed after an accident on the mountain and further thwarted by a less than convincing bit of plotting that sees his musician friend she nurses back to health down below fall in love with her. When he writes of his plans to marry her, it causes the forlorn Rist to stay in his remote cabin for another season only for a minor accident to leave him stranded in ever worsening conditions, his frost-bitten hands preventing him from making his own way down or even hold a match to light a fire to stay alive as a storm front moves in...There's no big chiaroscuro set piece like the recovery of the corpses from the crevasse in The White Hell of Pitz Palu, but there is a better sense of storytelling and narrative economy this time round. The plot may be simple - girl meets boy, boy thinks he's lost girl, girl and WW1 fighter ace rescue boy - but unlike its predecessor, when Rist finds himself trapped on the top of the mountain with frostbite he doesn't just sit around waiting to be rescued but actually tries to save himself, with spectacular results. Fanck's reputation for sadism is clearly to the fore in the footage of a real skier (possibly even Rist himself: Fanck thought nothing of putting actor's in harm's way) trying to out ski a very real and very spectacular avalanche in a film that has little truck with special effects (a few shots of lightning do look fake but the rest of the storm footage is very obviously the real thing). And rather than just leave him in a hole, the film keeps digging it deeper: crosscutting his forlorn return to his cabin as he battles against a storm with his shelter's door being blown off and window smashed, eerily filling it with snow to deny him any respite.Mont Blanc never becomes a character in the way that Pitz Palu does, but the footage is still impressive and exudes a sense of real danger. As in Fanck's other Berg films, you're constantly aware that both cast and crew put themselves in harm's way, but as compelling as the life or death climax is, there are still some good moments to be found elsewhere. There's a fascinating scene of Udet cutting his plane's engine and gliding past the cabin so he can carry out a conversation with Rist below, some energetic and visually striking footage of skiers zigzagging around each other on a scavenger hunt, a crosscut sequence contrasting Rist's Christmas in his cabin with its tiny tree with the huge tree in the hotel below (nature in the raw versus nature tamed, perhaps?), not to mention the futile attempts by his would-be rescuers to get across a crevasse.While it's nominally a talking picture, it's really a silent movie, the bulk of the film rarely featuring dialogue or even much in the way of sound effects and many scenes played almost mute. People only really talk down in the valleys below: once they're on the slopes it lets music, the sound of the wind or the rumble of an avalanche do most of its talking for it. Sometimes that's just as well, since Udet's dialogue in particular isn't terribly well synched and none of the other actors have anything worth saying. Yet in other respects it's still way beyond what Hollywood was doing at the time, avoiding the studio as much as possible to awe its audience with its imagery. Today it's pretty much the least remembered of Fanck's films, despite its belated US release as Avalanche ending up a source of stock material like many foreign films (some of the amazing avalanche footage found its way into Capra's Lost Horizon). Even the 90-minute print on Kino's NTSC DVD shows a bit more wear and tear than their other Fanck films, as if no-one thought it important enough to store properly or restore, but it's a decent survival story as long as you're not looking for a complex plot or rich characterisation.The DVD also includes one of Fanck's silent short films, Cloud Phenomena of the Maloja. With stunning footage of mountaineers looking down on clouds below as they float by or pour over outcrops like waterfalls, it's the kind of thing you suspect Fanck was happier with: just his beloved mountains with none of that story or character nonsense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5VCQE7TZK06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B837WY#wasThisHelpful","R3A5VCQE7TZK06","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The White Tower is one of those forgotten star vehicles that occasionally crops up unannounced in the TV schedules and surprises you with how enjoyable it is. It's a fairly simple story, with Glenn Ford's wandering ex-G.I. joining Valli's expedition up a mountain that's defeated everyone who's ever tried to climb it more out of interest in her than the climb only to find himself in competition with Lloyd Bridges' ruthless and unrepentant Nazi. Unfortunately, though the BBC have shown a decent enough colour print of the film, for some reason ever-erratic Odeon have chosen to release a pretty dire black and white version on DVD in the UK. Since the colour location photography is one of the film's biggest assets, it's a particular travesty, and the black and white transfer isn't even good in its own right.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10B4N596ZXHXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AMKI1M#wasThisHelpful","R10B4N596ZXHXA","A220FJEQNGMSRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A220FJEQNGMSRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

None of the children have really played too much with the ""accessory"" toys like the bangles on the side, the rolling ball or the jingly beads at the ton of the second pod.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GG0L9JJOWYMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KEEF66#wasThisHelpful","R3GG0L9JJOWYMP","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my son when he was 6 months old and he still gets a kick, or rather a shake, out of them. He delights in sticking them in his mouth since he's teething. He also enjoys shaking his arm and hearing the tiny maracas, perfect for his small hands, rattle. I had originally purchased these for my niece almost 2 years ago and I'm purchasing them a second time for my son now because I was so pleased with how they were received.

"My son is 7 months old and he loves to stick the clapper and the stick into his mouth. He can shake the clapper to great effect but he has trouble smacking the güiro with the stick.Like most of Hape's wooden toys, these toys are really well-made and stand up to heavy use (and slamming against the floor, play yard and other toys).

"In theory, the deal with this canister set is that they open when you press the ""button"" in the front which allows you to open the lid and then they close with the press of a finger on the middle of the lid. The problem is that this is only a theory. Instead, the lids definitely feel loose-y goose-y and I wouldn't trust them to store the regular daily used things I use my OXO Good Grips POP Rectangle 1-1/2-Quart Storage Container to store: coffee, rice grains, etc.As mentioned before, the sizes are ideal for many different things but the loose lids do not endear themselves to much trust.

"UpSpring Baby Milkflow Fenugreek Blessed Thistle Drink Mix does what it sets out to do. I started out using 1 package for day because I was scared that I would start producing like a firehose. I went up to to two per day when I realized that wasn't going to be the case. I didn't want to drown my child but I did notice that there was milk leftover once she was done on two packets a day. I didn't think I needed to go to three. I noticed the results right away.The drink mix is a pinkish red-looking liquid which takes only a few seconds to dissolve stirring it with a plastic straw. It looks a bit like watered down beet juice. It's very sweet smelling upon opening kind of like Koolaid or a sweet drink mix. It has a vitamin-y bitter aftertaste though that I wasn't fond of. I mixed it into about 10 oz of water with a straw for about a minute until it was completely dissolved. The flavor was really watered down at that point tasting slightly like sweet water with a vitamin in it. As I said before, a little bitter so the more I drank the more I disliked the taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOCAZ7LCUXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O96X4QI#wasThisHelpful","R3QOCAZ7LCUXI","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Freezer bags are so synonymous with one brand for me that I call them all Ziploc bags whatever brand they may be. But all freezer bags are not created equal. I personally love to use freezer bags for anything and everything inside and outside of the freezer as I always find them to be the sturdiest of whatever brand makes them.Hefty and other companies (aka not Ziploc) make freezer bags and honestly, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these bags and the Ziploc brand if you didn't look closely. Take a closer look and you'll find that these are much thicker and more opaque than Ziploc freezer bags using the same closure method. Being sturdier is definitely a plus!My only complaint as far as these bags go is that there is a smell much like Hefty's own garbage bags, my brand of choice for garbage bags in fact. If air them out, you can get the smell out but how many people air out freezer bags? As far as I've seen the smell does not affect whatever is stored inside and the bags prevent freezer burn very well!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JO771YWSI2FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUJ5UZC#wasThisHelpful","R2JO771YWSI2FU","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So what can you say about appetizer plates? These from Lenox look incredibly delicate on arrival for someone like me with carpal tunnel who is used to using the sturdy but nowhere near as exquisite Corelle plates. Handle these with care.The look is quite lovely: the black on white and white on black print is fetching and faintly reminiscent of a old school blackboard. The print looks sleek and modern. The photograph of the print on the appetizer plates looks much better in person. The phrases on the plates themselves are a bit kitschy and will definitely earn you a giggle from guests.The price is a bit much if you go through a third party seller but that's what you get for buying Lenox and/or quality plates. Definitely get them from Amazon directly where they go for $9 a piece.

"Whew, finally a toy that can sing for me so I don't have to go hoarse singing to my son! Oh wait, I already have!  This cute little Puppy (and his ""pink"" version Sis) both do a great rendition of the ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" and it earnestly sings ""I love you"" to my playful 7-month-old son. Puppy has a long repertoire of songs and phrases that he uses depending on the Smart Stages setting (I'm getting ahead of myself) setting.First, my one long-winded complaint: I was REALLY disappointed that the toy is not washable especially since the first thing my son did when introduced to Puppy was to put Puppy's ears in his mouth. Because of this, I washed it anyway. Given that my son is teething and prone to putting anything and everything in his mouth right now, I wanted to give it a wash and be able to wash it several times after.Obviously, the reason it may not be washable is that the toy has more than a few spots of electronics. It has a power rectangular piece in the back that's hidden behind a velcro enclosure in Puppy's back where you can change the batteries after using a screwdriver to unscrew the piece open. This is perfect so little hands can't get into it but also, I was surprised by how well it stood up in the wash. I do wish this was removable somehow for the wash.I washed Puppy on the delicates cycle and was worried when Puppy didn't talk right away. As soon as he was dry, Puppy was back to his old antics. The battery pack did fill with water that I was able to use a towel to dry off. Puppy's quite soft and huggable. He makes a perfect lovey when he's turned to the ""off"" or rather ""test"" setting. Puppy no longer makes any noises in the ""test"" setting so that's wonderful. He also has two other settings which work as a volume range of high or higher.My son is about as big as Puppy so from his point-of-view, there was a bit of a territorial thing going on for a second. We weren't sure if he was scared of it or just disliked it all together. He's still not quite sure about the buttons which are carefully hidden into Puppy's ear, hands and foot. He sings a rendition of ""Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes"" but unfortunately, his hands do not extend to his shoulders so that he can dance. Luckily, Fisher Price has already thought this out and created a dancing version which is very beloved: Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Dance And Play PuppyA dozen of my friends (no joke) have said that their children both 7-months-old and beyond LOVE this toy. I know exactly what they mean as I've caught my niece who is two and a half years old cuddling in a seat even when Puppy's not singing. Now, Puppy also goes by the name ""Doggy."" It also works great for siblings as the Smart Stages brand allows the toy to be programmed for children in three stages from 6 months to 36 months offering them different selected songs, music and words as well as the alphabet for their age range. I was surprised that Smart Stages was included in such a simple, reasonably priced toy but really glad. As another reviewer noted, it is however really easy for the child touching Puppy's foot to switch the levels up. It would have been nice if this had been a button on the battery pack as is the volume and test settings.I would definitely recommend this toy even if my son is a little unsure of it so far. Despite his mixed reaction, he was drawn to the toy and that makes it attractive and attracting. The earnest songs and music aren't annoying and are altogether pleasant. I definitely recommend it.UPDATE: Puppy has become the hit of our household. Despite first being a bit anxious around Puppy a bit, my son now goes to play with him first in our play yard. Puppy even has his own seat where one can sit and cuddle with him for hours on end. My son gets really excited now when Puppy starts to sing and more surprisingly, can activate Puppy himself by touching the electronic points on his extremities as well as his bright, beating heart.The DVD, however, did not play for me. Luckily, only my two year old niece was interested in it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFXQULX184G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO7HLZI#wasThisHelpful","R3IFXQULX184G1","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is really a two for one. I was surprised to see that it was for 6 months and up until I got a closer look at the little car. The handle can be taken away and then the toy car becomes its own toy. It's perfect for babies who aren't crawling yet. There are three fun buttons to push and the car moves very smoothly. As for the buttons, the whole toy is part of the Smart Stages brand from Fisher Price so you can choose three different levels of play and learning for your child so the toy grows with them.I asked for this toy so that I could give it to my niece while I reviewed it. She was quite ecstatic as soon as we put on the handle. She's 2 and a half years old so on the older end of this toy. She raced it around in front of her up and down the hallway for almost an hour and then around our house. Because she can run and walk, she was more interested in pushing it around than sitting down and pushing buttons. The toy car makes lots of fun sounds as you move it simulating noises a real car would make but in a more fun way!I can't express the glee on my niece's face when she got this toy so I can only describe something a mom of a former toddler can understand. She yelled ""mine!"" as soon as it was in her hands making sure that her 7-month-old cousin who crawls and was VERY interested, indeed, in the roll & crawl car very jealous. Both of them were much more interested in this toy than the stuffed animal I also received from Fisher Price: Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Smart Stages Puppy (with Bonus DVD)I have nothing against the color pink but I do wish the car was more gender neutral. I don't think my 7-month-old would car either way but I think it would have been cute in a different color as pink is so gendered.

"A great addition to any...diaper bag. You read that correctly. Munchkin makes some great trash bags for the most insidious poopy diapers and a trendy holder for your diaper bag but both are incredibly much more expensive when compared to these bags and this bone holder made for dog owners.I don't own any dogs but I do own a little animal that can make quite a mess on-the-go. I stick this dispenser on my diaper bag and if I lose it, it's easy enough to replace for an insanely good price. The bags are great though they do remind me of those bags for vegetables and fruit at the supermarket that give you the darnedest time as you try to open them.

"A pain to install, I had to have my sister, a childproofing pro, put these in when I finally figured out that the pain was in my hands. While she managed to install them, they were especially difficult to use on one of our doors where the handle was a bit tight. More over, my husband found them to be totally annoying and he couldn't for the life of him open any of the doors that were child-locked so in a sense, this offers protection from adults too which is not quite as it was intended.

"I am really impressed with this, my first bread bin ever. I've only ever seen them on TV. I purchased a bunch of them on Amazon but they were too small or too big or too long or too darn uncomfortable on my counter. Then I managed to see this one. I really like the oval. It takes up just the right amount of counter space in a kitchen where the cutting boards are built-in to the counter because there is such a lack of space.Cheekily, it reads ""BREAD"" so there's no confusion as to what's in it but you'd be surprised when someone asks you where the bread is and you tell them it's labeled what will happen. The look is utterly sleek, silky and modern in black with white lettering. It feels much sturdier than the MANY, many others I tried on Amazon that failed to win my heart.And be still my heart, it also has...a cutting board on top so you can cut your bread.

"After years of struggling with the extra-small bag, I upgraded to the large bag after my zipper broke many years after purchase. I've never been so in love. My Kindle fits in it. A full-size GIANT 33oz bottle of Smart Water fits in it. Despite how many things I can fit in what seems like a Mary Poppins-like travel bag, I still don't experience backache.I suffer from Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and a slew of other chronic pain conditions but I find that this bag is the only one I can wear for any extended period of time. If one side of my body hurts (mysofascial pain syndrome), I can switch it to the other. It's easy enough to pack light or heavy depending on how I'm feeling.The leather material holds up really well.  I felt bad about not going vegan but I previously used the microfiber bag and found that it just didn't hold up. I got some sunblock on it and the purse wore it until its final days. I couldn't believe how long the leather version went without encountering problems with my last purse, which again I was just too lazy to get the zipper fixed so I donated it and upgraded but much needed to a larger size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZH0H737G47RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CE5ZVM#wasThisHelpful","RZH0H737G47RH","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Despite how wonderful the 9W USB Power Adapter is for Kindle Fires, I still actually prefer to use this oldie but goodie due to the way the 9W folds.

"I think that I could have done without the spoon which as it turns out was too small for my son's 7 month old mouth. However, the bib is fantastic. I literally use it and throw it in the sink with the rest of the wash. It washes great. The entire set is completely washable and dries quickly on the drying rack. When I'm lazy, I use another one while the first one dries in-between breakfast and lunch (it really doesn't take THAT long) or loiters in the sink.The colors are really nice but I'm most appreciative of the flexibility of the material and the velcro flap that allows you to keep stretching out the neck area as your child grows with the bib.

Before Becky knows it, she's whirled into the fake world of celebrity and she's not quite sure how she feels about it as it starts to affect her relationships with those around her, including poor little Minnie. Just kidding, Minnie's always a little trooper.Meanwhile, Becky invites Suze, Tarquin and the kids to LA for a much needed vacation that quickly goes awry. After all, what could POSSIBLY go wrong with the world's most down-to-earth Lady and the weirdest (maybe) Lord shuttle off to LA for a not-so-quick vaca. ANYTHING. Definitely the unexpected that's for sure.And last but not least, catching up where we left off at the last book, Becky and her Scooby gang is in an RV (""very American) riding through the United States in search of her father and Tarquin who are on a top secret mission that driven Suze and Becky's mom Jane quite batty. Will they survive? Will Becky ever overcome her desire to buy everything and then one more of EVERYTHING?This book had me laughing at every turn but what caught me most unexpected was the really broken down Becky at some points in the book. I'm used to the books being lighthearted and perhaps they got a bit too lighthearted for me a while back. This book (I'm not sure if it's the final one or if the series continues) really puts things back on track with all the good characters showing up for posterity and even arch-nemisis Alicia B@tch Long Legs rounding out the crew.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZK4TFZWWEQL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010K2B2WC#wasThisHelpful","RZK4TFZWWEQL2","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is exactly what I was looking for. No matter how careful I am, I always end up spilling formula on the counter trying to get it from the scooper into the round opening of the bottle. Spilling formula on the counter can get to be an expensive habit. Of course, it doesn't help when you're trying to make a bottle with a baby in one arm and/or you're half asleep.This funnel fits perfectly into the opening of my Dr. Brown bottles on its bottle rung and I haven't spilled any formula on the counter since. It's very easy to wash. I wish it was collapsible because I would totally take it on-the-go in my diaper bag. It's a hard sturdy material.Thanks to the funnel, I've stopped using my on-the-go formula caddy to make bottles at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QNUA1R8EKOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS7LMRG#wasThisHelpful","R36QNUA1R8EKOY","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The diapers seem a bit thin. I guess that might be a good thing if you want them to be ""subtle"" underneath clothes. But seriously, everyone knows babies wear diapers.The feel is definitely soft but as compared to the Honest diapers I use, I'd say the Honest diapers are much nicer. Still, these Touch of Cloth diapers do feel nice to the touch.The sizes seem to be a bit larger than Honest's diapers and I could appreciate that.I think these are great diapers for the day time when you change diapers more often but overnight, the baby has a noticeable odor of urine in Touch of Cloth diapers. This might be better or worst depending on whether or not you have a son.Despite my criticisms regarding the diapers, I'm happy to say that there were no leaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MLE2XK2QL7JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOCKTV0#wasThisHelpful","R3MLE2XK2QL7JA","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used Gillette Venus shavers for years thinking they were my best option. I knew they had failed me when I temporarily switched to disposables I got on vacation and those disposables gave me a better shave. When I sent my husband to get me some more of those same disposables, he came back with some disposable Schick Quattro razors and I was honestly ecstatic.After being so pleased with the disposable razors, I decided to invest in the this razor with disposable razor heads. The handle is very comfortable and weighted. The rubberized feel of the handle is great and it definitely helps keep the shaver from my carpal tunnel ridden hands. I much more prefer this to the disposable version though I have no idea why Schick thinks as a woman, I need the handle to be ""scented."" I haven't had any trouble with the chemical scents despite my fragrance allergies but I did get the sensitive skin razors separately.

"We recently moved into a new place that had only a thin mail slot for mail that magazines and other larger parcels could not fit through.

We bought the matching guide post as well on Amazon and had it installed and haven't had any problems.It's the perfect size and all sorts of pieces of mail fit inside including large padded envelopes.

"I love this keyboard. No exaggeration. I have carpal tunnel and I was used to using a split keyboard before I purchased an iMac that came with this one. I haven't had any troubles with the keyboard. It is definitely not as sensitive as the super-sensitive, soft keys of my split Kinesis or old Microsoft ergonomic keyboard but it makes up for that in many ways. (They keys are as sensitive as any other keyboard on the market that's not advertised as ""ergonomic"" AND it is surprisingly ergonomic for a keyboard that isn't marketed as such.)This keyboard is the perfect, compact size. I've taken it traveling to use with my iPad. It also takes up so little space on my desktop that I'm able to use an Apple mouse on either side (I'm ambidextrous and also switch if one hand hurts more than the other). Also, because it's so compact, I don't find myself overextending to reach for either mouse.Unlike the Apple mouse which disconnects from the bluetooth all the time, I never have that issue with the keyboard. I honestly have trouble using my old Kinesis--which is probably better for my hands--because it is wired and not as convenient as this keyboard.As for aesthetics, this is an Apple keyboard. There's no question that it LOOKS better than just about any keyboard out there. It also holds up. As I said, I haven't had any troubles with it and the one issue I had with some keys after YEARS of constant daily use was quickly resolved over the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GM4OD4FGWAB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DLDO4U#wasThisHelpful","R3GM4OD4FGWAB2","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, obviously, my expectations were very low but I will never buy another hand towel at Target again! Despite being white, these towels have stayed vibrant after many washes without any kind of bleach. They've stayed the bright white in color that they were when they arrived promptly on my doorstep.Aside from how well the color has held up, I'm very impressed with how the quality of these 100% cotton towels.

After using regular shave cream for so many years, I got used to the idea that when I shaved my legs, I would have super dry awfully chalky skin.Then I found this product after using the Vanicream lotions. It takes a bit of getting used to after all those colorful, foaming, fragrant shaving creams that you can find at your local drugstore. Vanicream shave cream is thin, it doesn't foam, it doesn't have a scent or color. Despite how thin it is, it gets the job done. After I shave my legs now, I don't need to slather cream.

"I was really hopeful for this product.

I love that it doubles as a watch.Unfortunately, like many people have had, I had an allergic reaction right away. Within 30 minutes, my wrist was bright red and covered in hives. I had followed the directions on the product to the letter. I was disappointed to do some research as I was returning it to Amazon to see that this was very similar to the issues people had had with the Fitbit Force. The recall with the Force actually kept me from buying a Fitbit for over a year.Now I really wish I'd gone with the Flex as it has been around longer and there haven't been the allergy complaints that there have been for the Charge. Instead of getting the Flex right away, I've decided to see how Fitbit deals with this new situation with the Charge. So far, it seems as if they're just blaming it on the customer.Update: After being disappointed by the Charge, I returned it and got a Fitbit Surge. The Fitbit Surge did not give me any allergic reactions until the band broke in a couple of places around the wrist area.

"In the Amazon description for The Girl Below, it reads “enthralls with a strange magic akin to Audrey Niffenegger, Haruki Murakami and Sarah Waters.” On that short list, I’ve read Niffenegger and adored her books but I did not feel that kind of magic while reading this book…not even close.I received The Girl Below via Amazon Vine and started reading it right away. I put it down after just a few short pages because I was bored to death. The protagonist Suki Piper is not only unlikeable and insufferable but also terrible and unreliable. At one point in the book, it feels terribly ironic when Suki herself figures out that the other characters save for Peggy and her family find her pretty awful, too.I asked to receive this book because I am an Anglophile fascinated by all things British and I was intrigued by the story of Suki returning to London after ten years in New Zealand. The mystery in this book is not one dysfunctional family because I felt that was never solved. The mystery of this book is WHY we should read it.The book delivers bits and pieces that never really add up: including Suki’s mother’s death, her father’s abandonment, crazy garden scenes, inappropriate relationships and “exotic” locales from London to New Zealand to Greece.  The descriptions are lovely. The writing is lovely. There are books where a character is so interesting that you can look past their likeability but this is not that book. Suki becomes more and more unsympathetic even as we learn more about why she is the way she is (her family’s “mysterious” backstory).I didn’t grow to care for Suki no matter how much of the book I forced myself to read and I did force myself to read it until the end. The book aims for creepy and mysterious with strange scenes where Suki seems to walk between the past and the present leading the reader to wonder if she’s lost her damn mind or if these are fantasy sequences until all is “explained,” halfheartedly I felt, in the end.Suki seems to find her place, however disturbing and strange in Peggy’s family eventually but there are things like her relationship with the sixteen-year-old grandson that are just unreadable and further your dislike for her character. I really started to wonder why no one else in Peggy’s family thought that Suki was losing her mind but they were too preoccupied with the much more fascinating Peggy. In fact, a book that followed Peggy’s daughter Pippa and her misspent youth or the mysteries of her sulky grandson Caleb or even her son Harold or son-in-law Ari would have been more interesting","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5BLEFLR7XZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062108166#wasThisHelpful","R3E5BLEFLR7XZD","A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fans of rock star romances will be drawn to this tale of young love tragically torn apart and the pain and misunderstandings that festered over their years apart.  With the world of rock music as a backdrop, it's all about the love and friendship between three people and their journey to putting their pain behind them to find happiness.  As the second installment in the Sound Of series readers get a glimpse of the other band members of Destruction that leaves you wanting to read the previous installment while longing for the next as each musician is sexy and larger than life.Brent was a ladies man in high school but has become bored with all the women throwing themselves at him.  Sitting next to the smart and pretty Aimee who offers to tutor him changes his life irrevocably though as she's the one girl to lead him on a merry chase leaving him uncertain of their relationship.  When she's torn away from him by her villainous, and cliched, mother just as their connection takes a dramatic turn it sets him on a path of self-destruction amidst years of separation.  When she finally returns it will take a lot of forgiveness and putting past pains behind them for them to finally make a HEA.  Brent was a sweet and sexy musician whose befuddlement over feelings and relationships was fun to watch.  He was always there for Aimee, showing her he cared in every small word and deed, and it made him perfect boyfriend material.  He has a caring side, a big heart in wanting the best for those he loves, which further endeared him to me.Aimee's life was set in stone due to her parent's machinations.  Her lone act of rebellion was falling for the rock god which set her life off in a completely different direction which brought out the nastiness in her mother and years of fear and pain.  Reuniting with her lost love, whose love sustained her in her darkest hours, sets her up for more pain as she tries to right past wrongs in hope of a HEA.  Aimee was a bit naive at the start of the story, having lived a life of almost all work and very little play to live up to her parent's expectations.  Being with Brent gave her unconditional love and support, along with a strengthening self-esteem.  The event that pulls her from Brent is a serious one, emotionally intense, but takes on an over the top melodramatic turn that lacked believability.  Their years apart makes both of them stronger, giving them the chance to make a family as adults.Along with these two engaging main characters comes drummer and best friend Eric who's the sounding board for Brent and Aimee as they traverse their relationship.  Eric's the sweet, supportive, and funny friend who keeps his own feelings hidden so his best friends can find their HEA.  Eric lights up a scene with his big heart and endearing quirks and I look forward to him finding love in his own book that I'm counting down the days for.  From start to finish this is a story full of intense emotions.  The flashback section nicely sets up Brent and Aimee's reunion and shows the strength in their commitment if they can just move on from past hurts.

Hendrix might have come from a background of physical abuse with the idea of love foreign to him, but with his mother's guidance he's a sexy yet sweet man who goes out of his way to help those he cares about never expecting anything in return.  He's charming with a talent for dirty talk and though he doesn't think himself capable of love and commitment it shines through for that one woman in his every word and deed.  Surrounding him are two brothers battling their own personal demons but equally sweet and sexy with them a formidable trio always there for each other with playful banter and brotherly mocking which brought a smile to my face.  Each brother had a unique personality, immensely appealing in their brashness with moments of vulnerability that kept me enthralled with them.With Hendrix's feelings regarding love you knew it would take a strong-willed woman to win his heart.  The authors though didn't go for the obvious in that Olivia is a woman full of quirks and insecurities, but with a big heart to fully embrace all of Hendrix's need to be the protector and become an important part of the group he calls family.  Olivia came from a family of divorce which left her vulnerable to a betrayal by someone she called family and it's left her full of self-doubts.  After years of letting the negativity hold her back she's finally remaking herself, embracing her own naughty side and stepping outside her comfort zone with the luscious Hendrix as her guide.  Olivia's a delightful heroine who has an obsession with underwear with words of inspiration on them.  Whenever she needs strength she calls on those words, along with music lyrics, and each time she does it brings a smile to my face.  Olivia's a bit naive when it comes to sex, a bit unsure of herself because of her past, but it didn't hold her back when it came to Hendrix which made for some very hot scenes with bits of humor too.  I enjoyed watching Olivia gain inner strength as the story progressed and admired her desire to stand on her own but accept help when it was given. Seeing her transformation was like seeing a butterfly emerge from its cocoon and with Hendrix there every step of the way it made for a heartwarming journey to HEA.This was a story that moved quickly when it came to the relationship between Hendrix and Olivia.  With his desire to take care of her though it made sense and showed how big of a heart he really has behind his brooding nature.  The connection between them is sweet, scorching, and crackled with electricity as the sexual tension between them is off the charts.  Though both of them have pasts they're trying to deal with there were very few roadblocks to their HEA. There were no big misunderstandings or outside forces that pulled them apart. Many issues were hinted at, characters that seemed villainous, that were either forgotten about or too quickly and easily wrapped up.  In the romances I read I want my couples to have to work for their HEA and that didn't really happen here.  Despite that small quibble I loved this couple and their sexy yet heartwarming connection.  I enjoyed their playful banter that easily, and almost too often, segued into erotic sexual interludes.  Surrounding this memorable couple were Hendrix's two sexy and supportive brothers Morrison and Jagger. They're both hurting from the past, with very different reactions to it, with Morrison becoming a player (with two women being his usual choice) and for Jagger it's his fists.  They both hide behind a fun loving facade and I look forward to seeing their hidden pain released by finding the woman to ease it. From start to finish it's the characters who drive this story, their interactions charmed me and kept me fully immersed in the lives of the Caldwell brothers and I'm greatly anticipating the next installment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEUD1NK1GYTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YW4S19C#wasThisHelpful","R3EEUD1NK1GYTJ","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to m/m romance, I can always count on Ms. Addams to pile on the intense emotions that pull readers into the action.  She's done it yet again with this third installment in the Tarnished series and its young hero who gets put through the wringer to come out stronger on the other side.  She's crafted an atmospheric tale that has you living and breathing the ups and downs of the times while witnessing the differences between the haves and have nots.  It all makes for a compelling story with a protagonist you can't help rooting for.Picayune was born the child of a whore and his mother never let him forget it. He had a strong will though and smarts which saw him to success as a lawyer after recreating himself as David after years of her physical and mental abuse. All along his journey to betterment he was rewarded for his strong work ethic and good heart through the support of numerous people.  His mother might not love him but he created an unconventional family of his own.  Though he found success in his career love eluded him.  Growing up in the world of prostitution made many jaded when it came to love but not David who was holding out for something real and strong.  It left him lonely quite often and wondering ""what could have been"" in a twist that ultimately gives him what he's always wanted. David was an admirable character whose rise to success was hard-fought and richly deserved as he rose above his humble beginnings.  He never forget those who once cared for him though, helping those still in that world to find something better in scenes that warmed my heart.Aiding him in his journey to HEA was an intriguing and colorful cast of secondary characters that affected David's life in very different ways.  Growing up it was prostitute Spencer who brought a bit of cheer to Picayune's life and introduced him to the many realities of living in their harsh world.  Theirs was a relationship of love and friendship held back by fate from becoming more until a life-altering event brings them back together in a surprising and cheer-inducing twist. Spencer's a fun and flirty character who always brought a smile to my face for his outspoken comments.  He too went through some very heavy things in life and his road to HEA was another highlight of the story.  David's mentor Emile was another important part of his life as he was always supportive, never wanting anything in return.  He was scared of his sexuality becoming common knowledge which held him back from happiness when it was offered and took the story in a melodramatic turn that felt unnecessary by being what he wasn't. Emile though was a good man who gave David the tools to his HEA and I'm still hoping he finds one for himself.  This was ultimately an intriguing story with compelling characters that fully immersed me in this saga of rags to riches to romance.  Most of the characters were memorable and immensely likable with David's mother being the exception for her nastiness and cliched demands and actions towards the end of the story that added unnecessary drama.  Readers who like historical reads seeped in the language and sights of the times will be drawn to this m/m read and its sensual romance amidst the dramatic recreation of a single life and I applaud Ms. Adamms for her engaging storytelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33J73SZM0JLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VNYQE6#wasThisHelpful","R33J73SZM0JLE","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of sports-themed romances, and the movie The Cutting Edge, this romance captivated me from the first page to the last with its realistic characters and its charming friends to lovers romance.  The ice skating world is vividly depicted with twists and turns regarding which team would go to the Olympics keeping me on the edge of my seat and conflicted as to which team to root for.Courtney came from a middle-class family and had to work to be able to pay for her coaches and costumes.  Her family was emotionally supportive and only concerned about her happiness but it was on her to reach her dream.  With college on the horizon, this was her last chance to make the Olympics with her long-term partner Mark.  Though they work hard they've never achieved the success that was expected of them. To push them to victory, their biggest rivals are made their teammates with fireworks resulting due to personality conflicts, jealousy, and unexpected attraction.  Courtney once had an awkward encounter with Josh, but it's one she's never forgotten.  Facing him every day, and finding a kindred spirit, has them becoming friends and slowly something more. Expectations on the ice, and those off the ice, put pressure on a relationship that's already destined to end with the culmination of their skating careers but if they let it love might win out over familial obligations.  Courtney's immensely likable with her relationship with Mark one of siblings with little hiccups from time to time.  She's a hard worker too and loyal to those she loves.  Her relationship with Josh starts out subtly as she's always seen him as the enemy in their pair's world but quickly finds much to like.  Their romantic journey of friends to lovers is charming to see evolve as both found quiet support in the other, particularly Josh whose family is radically different than him in their beliefs and actions.  Courtney's wise beyond her years with actions that were understandable and mature with each roadblock thrown at her and I was cheering her on every step of the way.Josh comes from a family of wealth with a life planned out since birth.  In every way he's the opposite of Courtney but once they get around each other they start discovering lots of similarities.  He too remembers his teenage encounter with her and has been consumed by ""what if"" ever since which fuels the fire of their burgeoning relationship.  Josh is extremely likable, talented, and oozes charm.  Though others can't understand why these two opposites are attracted, Josh finds her to be his inspiration and his times with her the only bright spot in a life of severe expectations and judgments that might keep him from his HEA. Josh is sweet and sexy and his interactions with Courtney showed a man of deep convictions and emotions he's not afraid to show and I totally fell in love with him.Ms. Comeaux crafted a compelling story full of charm and angst.  Though the pace was a bit slow, and the story went on a bit too long, I was still kept on the edge of my seat through the twists and turns of competition.  The world of ice skating from practice to competitions was vividly depicted and brought out different sides to the characters, the reality behind the glitz of being on the stage, which made the characters even more intriguing.  The main characters of Courtney and Josh were an entertaining couple with a relationship that kept a smile on my face while I cheered them both on to living the lives they wanted. Equally engaging were the glimpses of Mark along with Josh's sister and skating partner Stephanie. These two skaters were opposites too, but identical in their anger over their partner's relationship, with their interactions crackling and full of sexual tension that I'd love to see dealt with in the next installment.  Throw in issues involving family dynamics and you have a story full of emotional highs and lows that affect these characters on the ice and when it comes to their futures off the ice.  I applaud the author for not taking the expected path when it came to which pair would win as it made for a richer, more believable story. All in all this new to me author crafted a story that pulled at my heartstrings while keeping me on the edge of my seat and I recommend it to those wanting a romance full of charm, sweetness, and believability from the first page to the last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HPSGGO7GZGL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MDXMQIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HPSGGO7GZGL4","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to emotionally intense reads Ms. Warren has become my go-to author for her interpretations of a gritty world inhabited by characters both complex and not easily defined.  Her Stripped series has especially captivated me for its darkness and feelings of hopelessness where you're constantly rooting for those few kindhearted souls to survive.Honor (Honey) Moretti was born into a family of wealth, but it was also a family mired in the mafia.  As a young girl she was given everything but freedom, living in a gilded cage alone and feeling unloved.  Her place in the family was one of being a commodity that her father gave to the highest bidder.  Her life of being engaged to a man of power purporting to be a hero was one of physical and sexual degradation, fear, and hopelessness though as everyone knew of her predicament but did nothing to help her.  With her sister's future heading in the same direction she was left with no choice but to run.  Where she ends up at is stripping in a place just as dark and gritty as where she came from and populated with women just as lost as she and working for a man of frightening power and mystery.  She's there to discover secrets about her past and sells her talents to Ivan to earn his protection and knowledge in a complex relationship based on sex and desperation.  Her life is irrevocably changed the day an intense man expresses an interest in her which leaves her emotions in conflict as her heart reawakens to the sensuality and sense of safety he exudes.  Just as a HEA seems possible her past comes back to haunt her and truths about her newfound hero are revealed in a maelstrom of bruises, blood, and bullets.  From the very start Honor is a sympathetic character.  She's cynical about men and love and in some ways is street smart.  When it comes to protecting herself though she's too kindhearted which puts her in constant jeopardy.  It's that kindheartedness, despite all the darkness in her life, that made her an admirable heroine that had me cheering for her to find HEA.Kip is a man of mystery who exudes power and sensuality.  He's drawn to Honey the moment he sees her in a scene that crackles with sexual tension and slowly morphs into something more powerful. Their burgeoning romance was sweet as he spent time getting to know Honor, but there was always a sense of foreboding when they were together.  Theirs is a complex relationship full of attraction amidst a battle of hearts and minds which kept me on edge.  As Kip's past comes to light it further complicates their feelings and puts her life and future in doubt.  Though Kip kept much of his past from Honor he was always there when she needed him, being her savior when all hope was lost.  He's a complex man who was once a criminal but after a stint in the military he's now more dangerous than ever.  He's sexy with moments of sweetness with a talent for erotic talk and action and I found myself drawn to him despite his secrets and dangerous nature.  His familial relations make this story more suspenseful with unexpected twists and turns that further complicate his relationship with Honor and ultimately shows him at his best and worst.  He's definitely a hero but one that is tarnished by fate.This is a dark and highly sexualized story with many of the women in it being abused in one way or another which might make some readers uncomfortable. While these vividly depicted scenes were hard to witness they do pull you in and keep your heart pounding.  Along with Honey, the other women at the strip club are hardened by life and love, with intriguing and painful pasts of their own just starting to be revealed.  They're all strong-willed though under the dubious protection of Ivan and bouncer Blue, with both men appealing despite their intimidating natures.  The world of the strip club is vividly presented in all its smokiness and sex with each character multifaceted which further kept me guessing and on edge.  Kip fits perfectly into this world as he isn't what he seems either.  He's a commanding and protective man whose feelings for Honor leave him confused but their mutual attraction makes for intensely erotic sexual encounters that are sometimes sweet but always scorching.  From start to finish I found myself fully immersed in this story despite a beginning that started a bit slow due to all the twists, turns, blood, and lust surrounding the denizens inhabiting this world full of greys.  It's a depraved world at times, an intense one that I look forward to revisiting in the next installment as each character's earned the right to have a HEA through each bruise to their body and soul.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0053HLBQ4M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCBR9TC#wasThisHelpful","R1R0053HLBQ4M9","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taboo romances have become an obsession for me, particularly stepbrother-themed ones, which is what drew me to this tale of soon-to-be stepsiblings who hide their mutual attraction behind snark and anger.  Getting trapped in close quarters though has them seeing a different side to the other allowing them to give into feelings long kept at bay.This story is one of insta-love and is a carefree read that brings a bit of afternoon delight to readers.  It's not groundbreaking but it is fun and flirty with a hero who's a bit of a player and a bit rough around the edges as he makes no excuses for his playboy ways.  Bentley's sexy with a bit of naughty in his nature who quickly embraces his protective side when he and Sierra are in danger.  It was an appealing change that had me rooting for him to finally grow up.  He's always seen Sierra as too perfect, and too judgmental, but their differences led to lots of sexual tension with biting banter that made their sexual interludes even more scorching.Sierra has always seen Bentley in a negative light for his playboy ways, but she's equally fascinated by him and the intense sexuality he exudes.  From the moment the story started, with their battle of the sexes underway, there was a sense of change on the horizon.  Their interactions were tense and teeming with sensuality just waiting to explode which had me on the edge of my seat.  Sierra may think she's different from Bentley when it comes to sex but seeing them together showed a couple who were equal in their intensity with her embracing her naughty side easily.  She may seem cold early on, but being around Bentley brings out her sexy side to add a bit of fun to their sensual interludes.From start to finish this was a fun read with a nice flow.  The character's feelings though weren't dealt with in any depth which kept me from fully immersing myself in their relationship.  The situation they end up in leading to their newfound connection was a bit melodramatic which made their proclamations of love a bit unbelievable.  Ultimately though, those looking for a book to take them away from the stresses of the day will find this a sexy romp with super steamy encounters and a tarnished hero whose charm is infectious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6SE8LE3T2XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UU1I0ZG#wasThisHelpful","R2T6SE8LE3T2XN","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bad boys of the Sinner's MC ride again in this exhilarating and fast-paced story of reunited loves and their rocky road to HEA as they struggle to get past years of hurt and misunderstandings.  Ms. Castille brings back all the bikers we've come to know and love and gives us insight into the darkness that has surrounded the quiet yet commanding Zane in a story where you can't help but be captivated by the sexy and loving bad boy with a heart of gold.Zane's childhood was one of severe physical abuse amidst a life of family drug dealing where everyone doubted his ability to make something of himself. Besides his best friend Jagger, the only bright spot in this unhappy time was good girl Evie whom he loved wholeheartedly.  A single event though led to a life-altering night that had him on the run for a crime he didn't commit and his beloved Evie desperate for a savior.  Years passed and hurts and misunderstandings deepened to harden Zane's heart to the girl he once knew until her life is put in jeopardy and his need to always keep her safe resurfaces. Theirs isn't an easy journey to HEA though as Evie's desire to live a safe and quiet life wars with Zane's brotherly feelings and intense loyalty to his Club. Between lots of bullets, blood, and tears these two will wage a super steamy battle over their future that takes a few unexpected turns along the way.  Zane is a strong-willed and intense man.  Despite being hurt by, and lied to regarding her son, Zane easily forgives Evie and takes the guilt over all their wasted years onto himself.  He's caring, sexy, and his interactions with Evie crackled as they engaged in their subtle battle of the sexes.  In the previous installments he was brooding with a laugh seldom seen, but here he's playful and flirty.  Being around Evie and Ty takes him back to a less cynical time that brings out a well-earned smile as his darkness is slowly washed away from bringing truths out into the open.  He's been my obsession since the series started and I fell even harder for him by the end of the story as he's a compelling dichotomy of sweet and sinful.Evie was the first heroine in this series to be unfamiliar with biker life which is part of my issues with her.  Since I adored Zane so much I wanted someone worthy of him and often Evie left me disappointed.  She wanted to live a normal life but often wanted to experience the wildness of her childhood with Zane once again which led her to this series' notorious villain Viper.  Her reasons for being drawn to Viper though seemed to be related to daddy issues and her belief that she could control him.  After Zane left all those years ago she let one man destroy her life and was on the way to doing it again when Zane and she collided in a scene wrought with sexual tension.  Evie was easily led astray with believing the lies Viper told her which was hypocritical and left me disappointed in her.  She assumed things about Zane but didn't give him a chance to explain as she wanted to keep wearing her rose colored glasses.  Though she was protective of her son I still felt she was too weak-willed to be in this world, even though she showed a flash of bravery towards the end.  Ultimately I would've wanted a stronger heroine for Zane, one who didn't spend most of the book wanting him to choose between her or the family that saved him all the years ago.This was an exhilarating story with numerous action scenes balanced with steamy encounters between Zane and Evie which brought out a dominant side in him that made the scenes even hotter.  I loved seeing all the bikers from the previous installments and witnessing their brotherly banter and playful dialogue. I also enjoyed Evie's outspoken, larger than life friend Connie as she brought some much-needed comic relief to some pretty tense situations.  Her comments about bad boy bikers are similar to mine.  This world is portrayed as dangerous but it's not until this book that we lose a well-known character (though I'm not entirely convinced it's for real) and it was a heartbreaking moment.  Ms. Castille included a few twists and turns, notably the evolution of Deputy Benson, that have me intrigued for the future.. Ultimately, despite its frustrating heroine, this was another compelling read in the Sinner's Tribe series which fans of brooding and delicious heroes will devour!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DE8GH232L1UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3B0TWY#wasThisHelpful","R2DE8GH232L1UI","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the popularity of Magic Mike, I'm frustrated there's not more romances featuring flirty and sexy male strippers on the shelves.  Luckily the drought is over with Ms. Huss' latest release introducing us to the charming player with a hidden heart of gold who unexpectedly falls for a woman who always assumes the worst of him and denies the existance of love.  From start to finish it's the sensual and complex Fletcher who holds your attention as there's vastly more substance behind his stylized looks which made for an intriguing unwrapping of the heartfelt layers that combined to make a hero worthy of the title.  I just wish the heroine had been as engaging as Fletcher as he routinely overshadowed Tiffy.  Despite my occasional irritation with Tiffy though this was still an immensely enjoyable read that I hope leads to more stories set in this world as it's teeming with energy, sensuality, and compelling characters.Fletcher Novak seems like a man in control of everything.  He makes a good living dancing in a popular male revue, has numerous moneymaking side businesses, and understands the intricacies of women like no other.  His reputation though isn't perfect as there's a long line of angry women who wanted more than he promised them.  With the future of the hotel where he dances hanging in the balance Tiffy Preston comes to straighten him out but has the tables turned on her unexpectedly as they begin a flirty battle of the sexes that changes his life irrevocably.  Fletcher comes from a family of money who, except for his grandfather, were cold when it came to emotions.  In every way Fletcher is hot, a man who embraces strong emotions, and soon finds himself drawn to Tiffy though he knows the low opinion she has of him.  Under the guise of helping her win the heart of the staid and sturdy man who sees her as a friend, Fletcher spends many hours teaching her the meaning of sexy and the power behind it.  While unleashing her hidden vixen he discovers he wants to know even more about her and show her that he's the man she belongs with which leads to a rocky road to HEA with her insecurities and trust issues putting them and readers through the emotional wringer.  Fletcher's a delightful hero who's loyal to those few who own his heart.  Even after everything Tiffy said about him and did to him, he still had her best interests at heart and protected her from afar.  He has secrets but he never lies, he's honest in everything he does even when others don't want to hear it.  He's smart too which all adds up to a compelling man who had me captivated from the first page to the last.Tiffy's early years were full of doubt, fear, and uncertainties as her mother raised her on her own making ends meet however she could.  It all left Tiffy a bit jaded even after her mother married into wealth.  Upon her mother's death she was left thinking love is a lie and those who rely on sex to make money are without honor.  These preconceived notions have her constantly at war with Fletcher but equally drawn to him.  At every turn he defeats her plans to fire him and his intelligence becomes an even bigger aphrodisiac for her.  Tired of being seen as a friend to her older co-worker Cole she hires Fletcher to teach her how to be sexy and win him over which binds them even closer together as she slowly discovers that her long-held beliefs aren't always true.  Overall I found Tiffy a strong-willed woman but a bit cold and judgemental at times.  She often jumped to conclusions and was slow to hear the truth as she always assumed the worst.  Being with Fletcher though brought out a softer and more carefree side to her that I enjoyed.  All she wanted out of life was safety, which the boring Cole represented, and it saddened me that she was willing to sell out her happiness based on her preconceived beliefs to get it.Fletcher and Tiffy were a formidible couple with a crackling connection and interactions that teemed with sensuality.  Their banter was witty, flirty, and showed their constant battle of the sexes which had me further engrossed in their HEA.  Tiffy was a woman tainted by her past and I felt sympathetic to her pain, but she still frustrated me with her constantly assuming the worst of Fletcher.  By stories end though she was a different person, someone more open and understanding due to the time she spent with him.  The other moments where Tiffy shined were in her interactions with her gay friend Claudio who was supportive but called her out when she was wrong.  Their banter was playful, a bit catty at times too, but always in the name of love.  Claudio was a breath of fresh air and I'd love a novella focused on his burgeoning romance with another dancer.  Fletcher though was the highlight of this story and I quickly became obsessed with him.  He was never what he seemed, he was a smart and sexy multi-faceted man, honest and loyal all wrapped up in a pretty package.  No matter what life threw at him he always came out on top and it's that strong will that made him the perfect match for Tiffy.  Though he too doubted love existed, he was willing to admit when he found it.  From its delicious hero to its sexy storyline Ms. Huss has crafted an exhilarating tale full of steamy encounters and unforgettable characters that I still have on my mind long after the final page was turned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJJIFI56O3MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01069Z99Q#wasThisHelpful","R3IJJIFI56O3MR","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a reader who's drawn to stories that put characters through the emotional wringer and Ms. Hansen has certainly done that here.  By taking her characters to the lowest depths of despair she builds them back up in a believable way that makes them even stronger and more admirable.  It's a gritty journey they take though, one with lots of tears and lots of regrets, but it's a very worthwhile one that has me ready for more as this unconventional family has more stories to tell.Jeremy once had a happy life married to the love of his life with a baby on the way when tragedy struck sending him in a downward spiral of addiction, anger, and regrets that his long-time friend luckily rescued him from.  His return to the land of the living is an emotionally intense one with each step as painful as the last.  A torrid encounter outside a bar though is the pentultimate moment in his recovery as he and the delicious Kai forge a connection that slowly deepens as both men move beyond their pasts to make a future together.  Jeremy is a compelling character who doesn't always say or do the right thing.  Grief sometimes brings out the worst in him but his lashing out is understandable as the events that befell him were unimaginable.  His journey of healing was easy to relate to as his feelings were vividly depicted with emotions that were palpable.  Through the early stages of his story you could feel the weight of his pain, but meeting Kai brought him a lessening of that weight.  Their connection was crackling outside the bedroom while their sexual encounters were scorching and intense with the battling of demons leading to more sensual encounters later on.Kai's life hasn't been easy either as his teen years were spent running with a gang which led to jail where he was emotionally, physically, and sexually assaulted.  It might've left him bruised but it made him stronger and set him on a path of betterment. He now works with problem youths with the interactions with these kids vividly portrayed and showing his caring side and understanding nature when it comes to abuse.  Kai's an admirable character who hasn't forgotten his roots which gives him a sexy bad boy vibe.  His professionalism in being a teacher also shines through to lend an air of refinement which makes his sexual encounters with Jeremy even hotter for this duality.  Kai's a heroic young man who's supportive and understanding and just what Jeremy needed to heal.From start to finish this is an emotionally intense read with feelings vividly depicted that brings readers along for the journey.  Their pains easily become the readers and it makes for a compelling story that easily immerses you in their battle for a HEA.  Kai is larger than life though he's a quiet and thoughtful man, he's caring and goes out of his way to help others to make him the quintessential hero who rose from the ashes of his painful past.  Jeremy's reactions to the painful events in his life make him a bit less heroic but being with Kai brings out a more kindhearted side to him.  Together they're an intense couple with numerous, almost too numerous, sexual interludes that segued into enlightening talks that gave readers more insight into their pasts.  For Kai, his past is one entwined with closeted cop Loren who's supportive and helped Kai get through what befell him in jail.  Their relationship was sweet, carefree, with playful sexiness that made for some lighthearted moments along with heartfelt talks and I look forward to seeing more of Loren in the next book in this series. Along with an emotional journey to HEA Ms. Hansen also dealt with issues of abuse and problems with troubled teens in a thought provoking way that adds to the story's overall intensity and leaves you thinking beyond the final turn of the page.  It's a story that's well-written, though it goes on a bit longer than necessary and juggles almost too many issues, but is one worth recommending for its powerful emotions and compelling characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE19AP266D82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159IYAP8#wasThisHelpful","REE19AP266D82","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who love heroes mired in pain and angst, but with a hidden heart of gold, will be drawn to former MMA champion Rory Kavanagh and his burgeoning relationship with the sweet but emotionally scarred Clare.  In a story full of familial love Ms. Robinson also addresses issues surrounding domestic abuse, along with drug and alcohol abuse, in a believable and heartbreaking way that brings the main couple together and puts their newfound feelings to the test as their pasts continually come back to haunt them.  From start to finish readers join them on an emotional rollercoaster ride that leaves us hurting right alongside them while cheering them on to their HEA.Rory was once on top of the world until arrogance left him vulnerable to a career-ending injury that left him lost and mired in pity with alcohol and pain pills his only balm.  He no longer knew what to do with his life and felt like a disappointment with rehabilitating abused former fighting dogs his only joy. One night stands were once enough for him but meeting the sweet and bubbly Clare shows him a path to a new life, one that has him embracing the positives and discovering the power of love he sees in her eyes.  Being with her gives him purpose and the desire to be a better man.  It also brings out a sexy and charming side, a glimpse of a white knight, that's immensely appealing.  Rory's protective of Clare but gives her the tools to become more independent, helps her in the way she's helped him gain the strength to recover fom his past both physically and mentally.  It's not an easy journey that he undertook but an emotionally intense one that brought out many appealing sides to him that have me annoiting him as my latest book boyfriend.Clare lost her family at an early age and ended up falling for a bad man who promised her safety and a feeling of family, but it was all a lie as he was an abusive addict.  He physically and mentally abused her making her doubt everything about herself.  In a moment of bravery though she left it all behind to start a new life doing all she can to regain her self-esteem.  Her newfound life ultimately entangles her with the supportive Kavanagh family, and the equally damaged Rory, with their friendship and caring nature giving her her first taste of family in years and the subtle encouragement to become independent once again.  For the most part I liked Clare.  She had a positive attitude despite everything that happened to her and did everything she could to keep herself safe.  Though she was at first afraid and routinely timid, being with Rory brought out a playful and flirty side that made their burgeoning relationship entertaining to watch strengthen.  The only thing that frustrated me was her not divulging her past to Rory much sooner, along with her acting the martyr despite the pain it causes Rory, which put her and their fragile relationship in jeopardy repeatedly.  Despite that she and Rory were a good match that brought out the best in each other.From start to finish this was a satisfying read that beautifully balanced intense emotions with sensual encounters along with vivid depictions of living the life of an MMA fighter.  The Kavanagh family are a delightful clan with their playful yet heartwarming nature and I enjoyed the glimpses we get of each member that has me excited for more stories featuring Rory's sexy brothers.  While Clare was an admirable heroine it was Rory who held me captivated with his charming and sexy attitude and his painful journey of recovery.  Ms. Robinson's depiction of animal rescue further showed his kind heart and made his dog Ace another highlight of the story with his good judge of character and heroics.  The sensual interludes too were nicely spaced throughout the story and were hot as well as playful and showed Rory to be both caring and commanding.  While the story does go on a bit longer than necessary it all leads to a satisfying and richly rewarding conclusion that shows the true power of love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369E9XB3ISF1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VD043F4#wasThisHelpful","R369E9XB3ISF1U","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fans of the older woman/younger man theme will want to add this to their list of enjoyable reads with its likable characters and steamy encounters.  It's a pleasant read, set mainly in an exotic locale, that charmed me even as it addressed the familiar issues surrounding this favorite theme of mine.Janie's on vacation after signing divorce papers from a husband who cheated on her with a younger woman.  For twenty years she devoted herself to her family, never going after what she wanted.  Coming to an island full of sun and surf has her vowing to relax and decide what she wants out of her new life.  Meeting the sexy and younger Zade helps her embrace the fun life has to offer and has her seeing herself in a whole new light, a womanly light where her vibrancy calls to him.  Though she has concerns over their age difference she can't deny how supportive he is of her, how good he makes her feel, and how much richer life is when he's in it.  With their time on the island coming to and end will she go with her heart or let other's preconceived notions take away the other half to her soul that Zade's become.  Janie's a strong-willed woman who's not as bitter as most divorcees as she can admit she's excited by this recent change in her life. She's a bit leery of Zade at first but their crackling connection soon wins her over.  Her concerns about age are understandable but an altercation towards the end of the story felt a bit manipulative and overly dramatic and left me disappointed in Janie.Zade may be young but he's wiser in years than most young men his age which will come in handy as he has to use every ounce of charm to win over Janie. It's a fortuitous meeting between two apparent opposites as he too is on the island to reassess his life.  Before now he's never had trouble getting women but Janie's initial low self-esteem has her leading him on a merry chase and him using charm, sexiness, and playfulness to win her over.  Zade's the quintessential hero as he says and does everything right.  He compliments Janie at every turn, supports her and inspires her to live life wholeheartedly.  Through his artistic talent he shows her her true self-worth even as she lets his age blind her to the truth of their feelings for each other.  He's sweet, sexy, and caring and you can't help but fall for him.This was an enjoyable read with a delightful hero and admirable heroine.  The setting is exotic and romantic and helped bring these two people together through fun and flirty encounters.  The sexual interludes were scorching at first and got even more fiery and frantic as their time together came to an end.  The issues surrounding their age difference are familiar and dealt with in a mostly believable manner with the final confrontation feeling a bit over the top.  The ending too was wrapped up a bit too quickly as I wanted Janie to be the one to chase after Zade for a change.  On a whole though this was a fun and flirty read with a drool-worthy hero that's still invading my dreams and I recommend it as a decadent diversion to the stresses of the day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWK15AGZ5YDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VO7Q2YQ#wasThisHelpful","R3PWK15AGZ5YDX","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who's read numerous romances between a girl and her brother's best friend I was immediately drawn to the premise of this book.  I expected the usual issues to arise within the pages but Ms. Jackson set her romance apart with likable characters and a charming and straight-forward storyline.  It's ultimately a story about forgiveness and second chances too with enough flashbacks to give depth to the characters and believability to their connection.Cameron knew he did wrong the moment he slept with his best friend's sister. Instead of dealing with it head-on though, he ran.  Ten years and he can run no longer and it's an awkward reunion he has with the girl he's never forgotten as this time around he vows to make her his permanently.  Cameron was immensely appealing despite his earlier vanishing act.  He's grown older and wiser and knows what he wants this time around.  He won't waste time waiting for Dylan anymore and it's a sweet yet sexy onslaught he unleashes on her.Dylan was once in love with Cameron which is why she was heartbroken when he left.  Ten years later has her older and wiser too, along with fiery and strong-willed when focused on her career.  Seeing Cameron again reawakens the feelings for him that she's kept buried but she won't be won over as easily this time around.  Dylan was smart and confident and gave as good as she got when it came to their sensual tug of war.Theirs is a connection that's crackling with sensual yet playful encounters.  Their dialogue was fun and flirty and teeming with sexual tension.  Neither of them obsessed over the past as they're clearly more focused on their future.  There's no silly disagreements impeding their HEA either which was a refreshing change from these usual romantic entanglements.  Ultimately this was a pleasant diversion over way too soon.  From start to finish this was a charming yet decadently delightful read between two likable people and I commend Ms. Jackson on her entertaining storytelling!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHJT3M7VOHC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143HCUHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHJT3M7VOHC5","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader, and an older woman myself, I was drawn to this older woman/younger man theme and charmed from the first page to the last thanks to a sweet and sexy hero and strong-willed heroine.  Though there's a bit of familiarity to the overall storyline it was a feeling of comfort that surrounded me and made this an immensely enjoyable read.  It may be the sixth installment in the Time for Love series but stands strongly on its own due to the compelling and likable secondary characters, engaging dialogue, and its sweet and sensual romance.  After reading this I definitely plan on starting the series from the beginning as the glimpses of past characters has me dying to know their stories and excited for what the future brings to the new characters as well.Bronagh's a confident woman moving on from a recent divorce, talented and doing what she loves in teaching culinary school.  What better way to move on than the sexy younger man rockin' it out on stage.  After a scorching night together they both know they want more but real life invades with issues that could tear them apart before they've barely begun.  Bronagh's a strong-willed woman who knows that her biological clock is ticking and doubts Brendan's ready to commit.  She also worries about the perceived improprieties of being his teacher.  These issues are understandable and addressed in a believable way that's the first hint at the maturity of Brendan beyond his years that gives you hope that they can have a HEA.  I liked Bronagh wholeheartedly as she's smart, funny, with a zest for living.  Her interactions with her girlfriends were an added bonus that brought forth more humor and had me identifying even more with her.  Their interactions were supportive and brought a smile to my face as they're the kind of friends you want for yourself.Brendan's another new addition to my list of book boyfriends as he's sweet, sexy, and oozes charm.  Once he sees Bronagh he knows he has to have her and is single-minded in his pursuit of her.  He's talented too with his culinary and musical skills which made him a favorite amongst the ladies.  He only had eyes for Bronagh though and I enjoyed their sensual tango.  On a whole he's a hard man to resist and Bronagh thankfully doesn't put up much of a fight as their connection is crackling and teems with sexual tension.  Brendan may be young in years but he knows what and who he wants out of life which had me cheering him on from the moment I saw him. His interactions with his brothers was equally entertaining as that of Bronagh and her friends with their playful and chiding banter which further charmed me and left me wanting to see more of his brothers.From start to finish this story held me captivated with its sweet and sexy romance, immensely appealing main and secondary characters, and realistic yet familiar storyline.  The romance too was sensual as Brendan showed even more talents in the bedroom.  Theirs is a romance that was scorching yet sweet that didn't gloss over the age difference but dealt with it head-on with their families having a vested interest as well.  It all made for a fun and flirty read with promises of more to come.  This was my first time reading Ms. Lopez but won't be the last as I enjoyed the family and friend dynamics she lovingly crafted which is just one of many reasons to recommend this book and series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KRXUK2JPL3FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WW3TJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KRXUK2JPL3FG","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who's accumulated numerous book boyfriends, I can now add Lincoln Greene to the list in this sweet, sensual, and heartwarming series starter.  From start to finish Ms. Van Dyken pulls you into this story of love, loss, and acceptance that will put you through the emotional wringer alongside its compelling and likable characters.Dani once had the picture perfect teenager's life until the death of her parents left her life in darkness.  Guilt, sadness, and loss may have taken her voice but it's left her with a wonderful support system who stand by her no matter what. Into her predictable world comes the unpredictable movie star who uses all his charms to coax her back into living.  Dani was an immensely likable heroine clearly bruised by her parent's deaths.  She knows her response isn't normal, which frustrates her, but can't get past her loss.  She's lost her sense of purpose, but with Lincoln dragging her into the land of the living without wearing kid's gloves, there's hope for her.  She's ultimately stronger than she thought herself capable of and full of sass and witty comebacks which made her interactions with Lincoln fun to watch.From the very start Lincoln isn't your average movie star.  He's not at all arrogant but self-depricating and immensely likable.  He was a charmer who exuded confidence that belied a painful past of his own.  He knew Dani was different when she became his assistant but didn't count on the profound affect they'd have on each other as their playful interactions became more meaningful. Lincoln was sweet yet sexy, never coddling Dani but taking care with her heart, while showing her the beauty in living.  Though his own parents weren't overly loving he knew the meaning and importance of love and slowly bestowed it onto Dani.  Their interactions were sweet, witty, and playful which made their road to romance all the more rewarding.This was a series starter spun-off from another of Ms. Van Dyken's series which reunites us with familiar characters and introduces us to new ones.  Though this book can stand on its own, reading about these familiar characters will immerse you even more in this tale and the denizens of this charming town.  It offers a unique love story between two people full of heartwarming moments and fun and flirty banter.  With their early interactions of texting showing a burgeoning friendship to the covert and sensual longing that soon follows through words and deeds, theirs is a romance that left me cheering.  Readers will be charmed by, and fall in love with, this intensely emotional story and I look forward to returning to this lovingly crafted world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SFCDRRWXBI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01402PNNW#wasThisHelpful","R34SFCDRRWXBI9","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every few months there seems to be a taboo topic that romance authors become obsessed with and that overtakes the bookshelves.  Right now the topic is that of stepbrothers and they've become my obsession too for the intensely emotional conflict that befalls those involved and the scorching interludes resulting from all that desperation.Into this crowded genre Ms. Adams has crafted a familiar tale that still satisfies as her sexual interludes leave you parched.  The main characters are appealing as well as their bond grows from friends to so much more.  Mia's the girl more comfortable hanging with the boys who's found a place for herself amongst the Phi Kappa Alpha frat boys.  They treat her like one of the guys and she blossoms in their companionship until Jaxon's attentions become more sensual. She's always found him attractive but never wanted to ruin her relationship with the other brothers, but giving in never felt so good...until the next morning. Finding out the sexy guy you just slept with is now your new stepbrother throws both of them for a loop and leads to lots of heartache.  For Mia, it leads to endless doubts and obsession over what was and what she knows can never be. It's a frustrating time full of disappointed and angry parents, as well as loneliness and feelings of lost dreams.  Will Mia and Jaxon's love ultimately triumph over familial judgments or will Mia find the strength to stand up for Jaxon and their future?  Mia's a likable heroine, sporty and unconcerned with girly things. She's athletic and it's this that binds her and Jaxon together early on as she becomes a formidable match for him.Jaxon's well-liked by everyone and popular with the girls.  His attentions to Mia start out playful but soon become more intense.  Finding out they're now related threw him for a loop that left her alienated but it was a reflection of the fractured relationship he has with his father.  His father continually holds his difficult teen years against him and Jaxon fully expects his father to tear apart his feelings for Mia.  It's a desperate time of anger and sexual tension that was palpable as Mia and Jaxon tried to ignore their attraction.  Through it all Jaxon remained steadfast in his feelings as Mia desperately tries to go back into the friend zone which had me admiring him.  I ached for him as his father's vitriolic words tore at him repeatedly and desperately wanted him to find happiness. Even if that happiness couldn't be found at home there were his supportive and fun-loving brothers cheering him and Mia on.This was a story full of scorching sexual interludes, almost too many that started to feel similar.  At times it felt like an obsession for them, and the main basis for their being together, but luckily the vividly depicted snowboarding events brought them together outside the bedroom more intimately.  The overall flow of the story was good but Mia's inner dialogues of wanting Jaxon but knowing they could never be became a bit repetitive.  The main characters were likable with a sizzling connection and I was rooting for them every step of the way.  As secondary characters I liked the other frat brothers but found Jaxon's father a cliched villain and a bit over the top in his words and attitude. While the ending was a bit too easily wrapped up with Mia's confrontation with their parents it all still made for a super sexy, deliciously naughty, and satisfying tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLWILTK8LAVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TFSZM2#wasThisHelpful","R2KLWILTK8LAVM","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life in The Point continues to emit danger as the line between good and bad and black and white remains blurred and as new villains arise as old ones fall.  It's a suspenseful read full of redemption, revenge, and unconditional support when it's least expected that adds to the romance brewing between two people from opposite sides of the law.  It all combines to make for a story, and series, that keeps you on the edge of your seat through the compelling twists and turns that befall the desperate and memorable denizens of The Point.Reeve has spent many years trying to live with the guilt that a vengeful choice left her with, but when given the chance to right so many wrongs she runs back to the hell she left behind.  Chasing her, and reaping his own revenge for surprising reasons, is a sociopathic man who leaves a bloody trail behind him as others seek their own revenge on him for all the horrors he's inflicted.  She's a tough and strong-willed woman who knows she's not good but wants to do better as she grows closer to the only man to really understand her.  As she and Detective Titus King play a dangerous and sexy game to bring the bad guy out of hiding, more bodies hit the ground as those closest to them are left battered and bloody too.  As their connection grows truths about their pasts come to light that proves they're a perfect match full of grays doing whatever necessary to protect the town they both care about.  That connection makes them a formidable duo that will make the villain rue the day he challenged them all.  I admired Reeve as she never sugar-coated her faults.  She knew she'd done wrong and wanted to make amends no matter what the consequences were to herself.  She'd always been attracted to Titus and their plan gave her the chance to grow closer to him and the dark sides of himself he keeps carefully contained.  Their relationship may have started off as one based on love/hate but soon grew to one of acceptance, redemption, and admiration.Titus has always wanted better for himself which led to his leaving his brother behind in a world full of rot, decay, and preservation by any means necessary. He too is desperate to make amends which has him fighting an unending war against criminals which leaves him conflicted as many of those he cares about skirt the role of criminal.  It's a fight that's wearing him out though and that's left him lonely.  The only woman to make him feel alive is a woman full of demons who brings out his wild side but might be his downfall too.  Together they scorch up the sheets in a sensual game that might get them killed in the end.  Titus is an admirable hero sworn to uphold the law.  He's a truly good man who knows he's not perfect but does the best he can for those he loves based on a moral code of his own making.  He and Reeve are combustible together and I loved watching their relationship strengthen through their acceptance of each other's pasts.This was a sensual story full of suspenseful moments that kept me on the edge of my seat.  From its heart-pounding prologue to its exhilarating conclusion this book left me in knots as numerous twists and turns were revealed throughout the story.  I was drawn to the main characters and their crackling connection that was teeming with sexual tension and seen through their steamy encounters that allowed Titus to let go of the tight control he kept on himself out of shame. I enjoyed seeing past characters return too and the important parts they played in this madman's revenge.  All of them are just trying to survive and I was drawn to the close-knit family they've all become.  I look forward to more stories coming from this gritty and compelling world after seeing the frustration of Nassir, the dangerous longing of Keelyn, the nerdy Stark, and the conflicted Booker who's falling for a good girl despite himself.  Ms. Crownover continues to leave me in awe as she beautifully blends romance with raw emotions in a realistically dangerous world that will keep you coming back for more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR47A37X3OFGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OG9IVNY#wasThisHelpful","RR47A37X3OFGC","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who enjoys emotionally intense reads, this one had that in spades. From its heroine who's been put through the wringer to the friends and family equally tortured by her poor choices and painful past, there's a constant feeling of foreboding and frustration that kept me turning the pages.  Add in two powerful men that treat Paige like a bone to battle over and you end up with a compelling read that keeps you on edge.  Though there's a HFN conclusion readers can expect more from Paige as she has a lot of healing to do and a past that's come back to haunt her leaving her HEA in flux.Paige is a young woman who has a tough exterior but is torn up inside after a painful incident hinted at but not revealed until the latter half of the story. She's thrown herself into work, exercise, and sports hoping to keep her demons at bay but they're slowly eating her up.  She may cuss like a sailor and give off a badass vibe but inside she's still a little girl with daddy issues that are the root of many of her problems.  Meeting the dangerous and mysterious Vance awakens her libido while meeting Matt awakens her heart as he provides her with unconditional support.  Being torn between two men harms her recovery even more but she can't help herself as they both call to her.  Even after her decision is made there's still doubts radiating off her and with past secrets coming to light she'll have even more doubts.  Paige left me conflicted as I applaud her putting her past behind her, but it's obvious she's still hiding from it as seen by her poor choices in romance and in her life.  She lets herself be dominated but demands control which reflected a wishy-washy nature.Vance and Matt are both larger than life characters with power and money to burn.  Vance is controlling while Matt is sweet and easier to talk to.  Vance is teeming with danger as he's not above using his power to crush others.  Matt's more likely to apologize for being overbearing whereas Vance doesn't know the meaning of sorry and relishes using his power to get what he wants.  Vance doesn't take no for an answer while Matt's willing to wait as long as Paige needs.  They're both intensely sexual though, teeming with sensuality, with both having crackling chemistry with Paige as seen by their steamy encounters with her.  Ultimately they're both compelling and I can understand being torn between them.Along with a memorable main cast of characters comes an equally appealing cast of secondary ones.  From Paige's brother Mark to his friend Danny, Paige has a caring support system who have problems of their own just hinted at. They're both sexy and would do anything for Paige, but aren't oblivious to her needing to get help when her pain starts taking over her life.  Their friendship's left hanging due to Paige's past coming to light and I hope to see more of them. This was a sexy story with a good flow.  The ending had many things come to light that threw Paige's life into chaos, a few surprising (not to me though) twists that greatly affected the course of her life throughout the story.  It all makes for an engaging tale that I couldn't put down despite my frustrations with the heroine and that will leave readers thinking long after The End.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AS0I9W7FKNAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XB8JCH0#wasThisHelpful","R3AS0I9W7FKNAM","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Into the crowded genre of rock star romances comes this gem of a series that beautifully balances likable and realistic characters with the chaotic and sensual world of music.  Add in a compelling main storyline along with engaging secondary ones and you end up with a story you never want to end.  Ms. Shaw shows true talent with this series that continues to shine and at the conclusion of this story I'm already counting down the days until the next installment.Kit is the lone girl in a family of strong men whose protectiveness borders on smothering.  Each brother is loving with interactions that are sweet, playful and heartwarming but leave her frustrated as she wants to live her life by her own rules.  This family dynamic was immensely appealing and led to one of my favorite secondary storylines of Kit's twin brother Kale hiding his homosexuality and being attracted to a new friend of Kit's who's everything Kale wishes he was.  Kit and Kale are so supportive of each other and are always watchful of the other's hearts and dreams which Kit will need as she joins a band on the brink of stardom.  Though she longs to take this crazy ride she knows her heart will be in jeopardy as one of the guitarists is the man she's had a crush on since she was a teen and who she gave her virginity to.  That life-altering moment left her heart bruised as he never called her again but she won't let it stand in her way of being a guitarist with a successful band.  She always knew she was meant for something bigger and this is her chance.  Being around Shawn brings out a myriad of emotions in her, some heartbreaking and some juvenile, as he constantly shakes her self-esteem.  These moments of juvenile behavior sometimes frustrated me as everything would've been resolved much sooner if she'd just spoken of her feelings out loud instead of always waiting on him. Through it all though she remains a strong-willed woman in a man's world who gives as good as she gets and whose witty and flirty banter made her even more of a badass rocker!Shawn has always been popular with the ladies but music is what holds his heart.  One fateful night he meets a girl who names him as the reason she became a guitarist which made for an instantaneous connection that never truly went away despite his ruining the memory through his unintentional callousness.  With Kit joining the band emotional complications arise as she brings out the best and the worst in him.  He's the creative one in the band, the one who writes the lyrics and crafts the music, and collaborating with Kit makes their songs masterful.  Since their first meeting the sexual tension between them is off the charts and though they start off as friends it's clear they're destined to be more.  It's a rocky journey though as he's better at writing about emotions than acting on them out loud.  There's lots of hurt feelings and lingering anger over the past, but unlikely allies help him right past wrongs to reach an immensely satisfying HEA.  Through it all I found myself drawn to Shawn and his sweet yet charming nature.  He might not always make the right choice but his heart is always in the right place.This was a delightful read from start to finish with memorable main characters and equally engaging secondary ones.  The secondary characters are some we know and love along with a few new ones whose stories I long to hear.  Each character though feels like family with interactions that brought a tear to my eye as well as a smile to my face.  Shawn and Kit are combustible as even when they're apart you can still feel their crackling connection.  Kit's my favorite kind of heroine with her tell it like it is attitude and the unconditional support she gives to those she loves.  Shawn's strong and sexy and not afraid to show his softer side that's an appealing dichotomy to his bad boy rocker persona.  The rock 'n roll world is vividly depicted with all its sensuality and energy and these scenes immersed me in the story even further.  While this book can definitely stand on its own, with such likable characters and engaging storylines you won't want to miss a single moment.  Ms. Shaw's Mayhem series continues to impress with its engaging characters and storytelling and I recommend it highly to those looking for a memorable read that you'll be thinking about long after the final page is turned!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ROIJOHX5SXEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N81I66I#wasThisHelpful","R2ROIJOHX5SXEI","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After all the action and premise set-up in the previous series installment things continue along the same vein with this novella.  The story continues to excite as the pages combust with a menage relationship that's super steamy and shows how far the heroine has come in healing after the atrocities dealt her by those who prey on a world gone crazy.  With two strong heroes to support her a HEA is guaranteed as we get to know more about these former soldiers and the safe haven they've created.Lia was once mired in darkness after the brutalizations done to her in Flash Bang.  Through the sensitivity and caring attentions of two very different men Lia sees a hint of brightness as she no longer jumps when encountering men nor finds herself haunted by nightmares.  She finally feels like the woman she was before the world ended and finally wants to admit her attraction to Cam and Travis.  It's not an easy decision for those involved but with the world in flux personal judgments no longer matter.  Lia's an admirable heroine whose journey to recovery was palpable with feelings of fear and self-doubt.  I applaud her owning her decision as to wanting both men and for not letting them make decisions for her anymore once she's found herself again.Cam and Travis are a formidable pair, best friends since the military.  Their personalities may be different but together they meet all of Lia's needs both sexually and emotionally.  Cam was the more serious of the two and the one with issues of possessiveness that made him the hardest to convince when it came to sharing. Travis was more playful and easygoing, easily accepting of sharing as he was focused on Lia's needs.  Together, they're both sexy and protective with flashes of a painful past for Cam that drives him to take care of Lia and claim her for himself.  Travis is drawn to Lia too but finds his friendship with Cam just as important and will do whatever it takes to make all of them happy.This was a quick yet decadent read with likable characters and scorching sexual encounters.  When it comes to the heroes, and their different personalities, there's a lot of similarities to Flash Bang.  The heroes are all sexy and protective and carry out their menage relationships without too much concern.  The overall story arc doesn't progress much with this installment either beyond reiterating how much worse things have gotten with the government's burgeoning involvement.  Overall though I enjoyed this story and look forward to where the increasing danger, and a new addition to the ranch, takes us next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9DCGH8MCI3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FRIUWO#wasThisHelpful","R3U9DCGH8MCI3F","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who obsesses over MC-themed romances I was immediately drawn to the premise of this book.  The world Ms. Crane has crafted is an intense one full of tension and secrets and it all adds up to a memorable read.  From the first page to the last I got a larger than life main couple whose connection was combustible and a few hints regarding an over-arcing mystery that have me hopeful for future installments.Ajax joined the club when he was young and found a father figure in Priest.  His devotion to the club, and to Priest, was always more important than his needs which had him denying his attraction to Sophie and ultimately leaving the club to save it.  With Priest's death though he's returned to a city changed and a club left broken with members full of anger.  The biggest change is to the once sweet and quiet Sophie who's now loud and bubbling with unleashed sexuality. Though Ajax once swore to leave her untouched the temptation she presents becomes too much and leads them on a steamy journey of acceptance of themselves and each other.  Ajax is a compelling lead, rough but super sexy.  His life has been full of bloodshed but it's not something he'll ever apologize for and I enjoyed his strutting through the story.Sophie was once sweet and sheltered but couldn't be further from that with the death of her father.  She's strong-willed and clearly able to take care of herself, but there's hurt there too, hiding behind bravado.  Luckily Ajax is there to help her work past her anger through their numerous sexual encounters that practically jump off the page with their intensity.  Though she wants to separate herself from the gritty MC world she's become more entrenched in it through her newfound personality and it made her interactions with Ajax more entertaining as she gave as good as she got.Along with all that though were a few issues that kept me from loving this story. The biggest problem is the excessive amount of inner dialogue that keeps the main couple from interacting on a deeper level.  Thinking isn't the same as saying it out loud which made their relationship feel a bit superficial, almost entirely based on sex.  I have nothing against steamy reads as I love them, but when sex takes away from the storyline I'm left frustrated.  The inner dialogues also bordered on purple prose which didn't feel true to the characters.  The crux of the storyline seemed to get lost as Priest's murder, which is hinted at, barely got referenced.  The return of the other bikers often got set aside which was a wasted opportunity in setting up future installments.  Those issues aside, I enjoyed the connection between Sophie and Ajax as it crackled with sexual tension.  Their sexual encounters were scorching and had a good flow that kept me engrossed in their sensual tug of war.  Readers who enjoy super steamy reads will find this a decadent delight with a hint of more excitement to come!3.75 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ICDMLBOQNXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEPS8TG#wasThisHelpful","R9ICDMLBOQNXW","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fan of sports-themed romances I was immediately drawn to the premise of this story that's part of the More Than a Game series but can definitely be read on its own.  Though there's familiarity in the action it's the characters that sets this book apart from the crowded genre as each of the main characters is immensely likable and endearingly flawed.  From start to finish Ms. Mathews has crafted a tale that's sweet yet sensual with no real angst but deep emotional growth that fully immerses readers in their journey to HEA.At one time Annabelle Jones was the fantasy of every guy, her face gracing the pages of magazines and walls until she left the business to get married and have beautiful twin girls.  Becoming divorced and moving across the country has her starting over until a car accident derails her plans.  With no one to count on to help her recover she's forced into accepting the help of her sexy neighbor who she's been attracted to since he moved in.  The more time they spend together the more they come to count on one another for the emotional support that's always been missing from their lives to make a future together.  Though Annabelle was a model she didn't have superficial trappings, others may have placed value on her looks but she did not.  She was a strong-willed woman who didn't live to ask for help who only wanted to be a positive role model for her daughters.  Despite all the times she was knocked down she always got right back up, never wallowing in pity.Nathan Cooper's entire life has been devoted to baseball until an injury and a poor choice leaves his career hanging in the balance.  Guilt and shame are his only companion now as is disappointment in himself for the fans who once called him hero.  Though he's recovered from his injury he's still paralyzed by all these feelings weighing on him with the only bright spot being his fantasy girl living next door.  Though he doesn't feel worthy of her and doesn't want the truth about himself to come out to her, he can't help coming to her aid when she needs it most.  Seeing himself through her eyes, and that of her daughters, gives him a feeling of worth beyond just baseball.  Cooper's a delicious hero who knows he did wrong and truly wants to make amends.  Though he's attracted to Anabelle he doesn't want to bring any negativity to her life as she's rebuilding hers, but when she needs his help he steps up to the plate in heroic fashion.  He shows himself to be a loyal and loving man with more to offer than just his talent to play baseball and his charming interactions with Annabelle's daughters endeared him to me.This was a sweet and sensual story with a lot of heart.  The friends to lovers relationship progressed a bit slowly but Cooper and Annabelle's interactions charmed me as it felt like two teens experiencing love for the first time.  Though I prefer a bit more steam when it comes to the sexual interludes I still found these moments satisfying.  Along with the wonderful main couple came the equally delightful Olivia and Sophie, Annabelle's twins.  I don't normally like children in books but they were entertaining with antics that put a smile on my face.  They also brought out an unexpected paternal side to Cooper that made me like him even more.  From start to finish this was a satisfying read that gave me lots of warm fuzzies while reading it and I recommend it to all lovers of romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15FVJ0QH6J02V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1I2SDM#wasThisHelpful","R15FVJ0QH6J02V","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who enjoy romances featuring opposites attracting will find themselves charmed by this tale from the first page to the last.  With its colorful characters and steamy encounters evolving from a sweet and endearing friendship based on a lie you can't help but root for a HEA between Luke and Kai.From the moment he decides to take Kai to his sister's wedding Luke knows his life will never be the same as his plan to stay far away from love and commitment brings it ever closer as he and Kai discover their supposed differences make them the perfect match.  Unlike his parents, class differences don't mean anything to him as he doesn't judge Kai by her bright cover.  Luke's a hardworking man who wants to forge his own path in life away from his parents machinations and Kai's to be his buffer during the week-long wedding festivities.  Everything about her that upsets his parents excites him though and pulls him to her in a combustible connection that quickly morphs from friends to lovers.  By story's end readers are just as surprised as Luke by their deep emotional connection and just as charmed by Kai's sparkling personality.Kai might drape herself in a rainbow of colors but it belies a past of darkness, a past that I would've liked to know more about.  She's a strong-willed and outspoken woman, full of artistic talent, but has never allowed herself to get close to others.  Being with Luke though has her showing him glimpses of her true self and over their week together their supposed differences bind them together and had me cheering them on towards HEA.This book's theme may be familiar but it's a feeling of comfort from start to finish as the characters charm you with their fun and flirty banter and honest talk.  Their initial connection may be based on a lie but the feelings that result are honest and heartfelt.  The sexual interludes are also scorching and further expressed Kai's carefree nature and Luke's embracing of a life lived for oneself.  Surrounding this likable main couple is the intriguing and exciting backdrop of Goody's Goodies Sex Toy Store which brings in colorful customers and is staffed by an even more colorful group who slowly integrate themselves into Kai's life.  Celia's the dancer and writer who wants to be so much more and still believes in love, while Joe is the sexy MMA fighter whose heart was broken by Luke's sister.  Both of these characters endeared themselves to me and I hope to see more of them in the future.  Readers looking for a charming and heartwarming story will get just that as well as a steamy tale proving that love comes when you least expect it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LL2WLN2Z6YZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01096C1ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LL2WLN2Z6YZ0","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the title of this story implies a topic of a taboo nature, the actuality is far different.  This story beautifully blends a sensual romance with humor and shows deeply intense connection between two people who might seem very different but end up being a perfect match.  From its exhilarating prologue that hints at the sexiness and conflict to come to the unexpected humor, appealing characters, and surprising emotional depth this story captivated me from the first page to the last.After the dissolution of her over 20 year marriage Mia's feeling a bit lost wondering what sent her husband into the arms of the mother to her son's best friend.  Once she's spent enough time wallowing in grief though she picks herself up and remakes herself through exercise and finally following her dream of pursuing a career in art with paintings that hint at a sensual side long suppressed by her ex-husband.  With her colorful sister Stella's encouragement she's also reawakening her sexual side.  Unfortunately it's her son's best friend Grayson who's lit a fire within her which leads to some inner conflict but also lots of steamy encounters along with a surprising emotional connection and personal growth for both of them.  Mia's a delightful woman who got knocked down but sprang right back up stronger than before.  She may be a bit shy about sex but Grayson brings out her wild side which makes her a bolder person overall.  Throughout her marriage she was stifled, devoted only to her husband and son with nothing to call her own.  By story's end she's grown into a woman who goes after what she wants, who finds joy and happiness in just living, and who's found the right kind of love with a man who helps her embrace living and loving.Grayson's always been a bit of a player, a young man who's always gotten what he wants.  He's sexy and he knows it but he has a good heart deep down despite the occasional misstep.  After returning from schooling abroad though he's a bit changed as his young girlfriend now bores him and he misses the deep conversations he had abroad.  Grayson appears to have matured, grown a bit older and definitely wiser.  With his new outlook comes a new appreciation of Mia too which some might find taboo, but I found sexy and heartwarming.  Grayson might be drawn to her for purely sexual reasons at first but the more time they spend together the closer they grow emotionally with each supporting the other.  He brings Mia out of her shell reminding her that she's still desirable while finding himself excited by her in bed and out.  All along he builds up Mia's confidence while filling a void within himself that her love gives him and I enjoyed their sensual and emotional journey every step of the way.Theirs is a journey not without a bit of conflict as guilt over what Mia's son, and Grayson's best friend, Adam might think weighs on them.  There's also issues of low self-esteem for Mia early on that Grayson's sultry glances and sexy talk quickly dispel.  These issues, while realistic, ultimately didn't end up being as big an issue as you'd think though.  This couple is delightful with their witty and playful banter and an immediate connection crackling with sexual tension after the months he's spent abroad.  He brings out her carefree side while she gives him the mature interactions he's been craving since coming home.  They're delightful to see together with sexual encounters that left me parched and I was rooting for them every step of the way!  Surrounding this wonderful main couple was a strong cast of secondary characters that added to my overall enjoyment of the story.  I liked Adam and his protectiveness of his mom along with his support of her after finding out about her husband's affair.  He's a good friend to Grayson too but has his own secrets when it comes to relationships.  The most colorful of them all is Mia's sister Stella who's larger than life.  She's outspoken and lives life to the fullest and is the impetus to Mia and Grayson getting together with her blatant blessings.  She's a wonderful character who practically leaps off the page and I'd love to see more of her!  This was a wonderful story from start to finish, despite its rushed ending, that is so much more than what you'd expect and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KRMI40UHXKTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S989BP0#wasThisHelpful","R3KRMI40UHXKTM","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the m/m genre will find themselves quickly caught up in the complicated relationship between a football coach on a journey of self-discovery and the professor whose heart was left bruised by their long ago encounter.  In a single moment the lives of these two men changed irrevocably as the seemingly straight Preston left his mark on Alec's heart during a steamy clandestine encounter that had Preston running back to his girlfriend and Alec hardening his bruised heart to love.  A meeting years later gives them the opportunity to explore what once scared Preston and for Alec to express the pain Preston's rejection left him with which is the first step in their rocky road to HEA.This was a quick read with a nice flow and steamy encounters paired with sweet interludes.  Alec may have started off a bit cold, but a bruised heart and ego can do that.  Preston seems to have everything under control at first glance but seeing Alec again unsettles him and makes him see himself in a different light, in a way he's tried to suppress.  Together they're a couple full of conflict, but you can't help rooting for them despite Preston's missteps.  The story is almost solely focused on these two men which gives us time to get to know them and revolves around issues of ""coming out"" and the reactions of others, but mostly that of Preston's inner conflict.  Whereas Alec is fully out, Preston is still confused about his sexuality even as he's spending nights with Alec which left Alec feeling like a dirty secret and me frustrated.  It taints their burgeoning relationship and once again leaves Alec feeling used like all those years ago.  It's not until Preston's gets a glimpse of Alec without him that he finally puts his heart on the line and accepts what his heart has been telling him for years.  At times Preston's reactions seemed a bit over the top but the sweet and sexy connection between him and Alec kept me fully invested in them and quickly turning the pages to their endearing and heartwarming conclusion.3.75 STARS!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8UR30FPARS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01095LJYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C8UR30FPARS9","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picking up right where the previous installment ended, Noah and Stone's fate is being discussed by the Club after their game changing decision saved Star but left fallout of even bigger proportions.  There's little time to fear for their lives though as Noah's sister has been taken and Star makes it her mission to help find her, which leaves her and Noah at odds as she gets an education on women's roles in their MC world.  Along with this non-stop action is even more steaminess between Star and Noah bordering on bdsm that gives greater insight into her childhood and his ability for kindness behind his tough guy facade.This was a quick and decadent read, almost too quick with a middle section that felt like filler.  Ultimately though this story is a quick fix for romance addicts that pulls you in more fiercely with each installment.  We get introduced to more characters inhabiting this gritty world that provide a glimpse of heart and soul to this dark world and has me hoping we'll see more of them.  Star continues to show her strong will despite Noah's dismissal of her help in public.  In private though he shows his faith in her and her growing importance to him that continues to endear him to me.  Stone's quiet support and subtle snark continue to captivate me too as I eagerly scan the pages waiting for his arrival.  By story's end, loyalties are put in doubt as are the lives of Noah, Stone, and the rest of the Devil's Host MC....unless Star can get to them first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1725M1F201GPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106MJ1GK#wasThisHelpful","R1725M1F201GPW","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Readers who like their stories steamy, with plots that aren't cookie cutter, and characters that are complex and full of inner conflict will be drawn to this dark and angsty read.  It's a read that's not always easy as it deals with intense emotions and the darker aspects of life, but it's one that pulls you in from the first page to the last.Though this book is the second installment in Ms. Warren's Stripped series it can stand on its own as the author, from the very first page, jumps right into the action through the heroine's viewpoint.  Through this heroine, Lola, we discover a tale full of pain and sadness that's made her who she is today.  Being stuck in the foster care system as a child led to a lot of dark moments that have given her trust issues along with lots of painful memories that have hardened her heart.  The only bright spot was the time she shared a home with Blue...and even that ended badly as her lie sent him away.  She's a survivor though, a woman not proud of being a stripper but doing what she has to to care for the woman who represents family to her.  She always saw Blue as her savior but his becoming bouncer at her club makes him a threat as she suspects he's back for revenge for her long-ago words.  It's ultimately a dark revenge he's after focused on her body that leaves her conflicted as she understands his anger but is still drawn to him.  As their sexual encounters become hotter, past feelings bubble to the surface blurring the lines between revenge and love.  Through it all Lola remains a strong-willed woman you can't help but root for after all she's survived.  Her conflict over Blue's attentions to her are understandable as their connection is crackling and full of sexual tension that had me hoping they'd find HEA.Blue is the quintessential anti-hero as he oozes darkness and rage early on.  Being around Lola leaves him conflicted though as years of anger have made him the brutal and dangerous man he is today.  His words towards Lola aren't always kind but remembrances of the feelings he once had for her leave him protective of her and wanting the only man touching her to be himself.  Blue's not always likable, with words sometimes cruel and hurtful, but he's larger than life and his mere presence drives this story and kept me captivated despite his bad behavior.  It's his flashes of care and concern towards Lola, along with his posessiveness, that had me hoping for their HEA and his intense sexuality and talent for taking dirty that had me fully immersed in their deepening relationship.  From start to finish readers will be intrigued by Blue despite his obvious flaws as there's a good man hiding behind a mountain of pain.  His journey towards self-acceptance and moving past years of pain and anger is a rewarding one made richer with the possibility of sharing it with the one woman he truly cared for.Ms. Warren has crafted a compelling story with realistic characters dealing with heavy emotions.  The characters are a bit rough around the edges, jaded by life, but their tale is one you can't help getting caught up in.  Though I was hoping for a fuller epilogue I was still satisfied by where Lola and Blue are at the end of the story.  On a whole this is a story that fully immerses you from the first page to the last, entrenching you in its sensual haze, and I look forward to where Ms. Warren takes us next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0Q44LM9NXWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKJSLQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0Q44LM9NXWW","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of the m/m genre Ms. Harris has crafted many satisfying stories and while this one isn't her best it still has a nice bit of charm with a diverse cast of characters to bring small town living alive.  In this tale of opposites attracting the emotional angst runs high as one man is outed in an incident caught on video while the other is fighting to stay in the closet.  Together, will these two find HEA or will they let the outside world rule their future?In an attempt to keep his sexuality secret young actor Blake only succeeded in making it even more public.  While waiting for the gossip to die down, and to figure out how to ressurect his career, he's hiding out far from Hollywood and licking his wounds in a self-destructive way that engendered a bit of sympathy.  Meeting the town's sheriff though changes his life irrevocably as he's forced into seeing himself in a whole new light, a light that he might like a whole lot better than what Hollywood sees.  Working with the town's youth theater is the first step in salvaging his career but also puts him in contact with a colorful and memorable cast of secondary characters that brought out a down to earth side to Blake.  Between sensual moments with Jack and his enjoyable interactions with the teen actors Blake is left wondering what will truly make him happy, but with his strong-willed agent desperate to gain him fame again, the sweet and sensual burgeoning relationship with the sheriff might be over before it starts.Jack has been keeping a very big secret, not only from the denizens of the town he's sworn to protect but from his family as well.  He has his reasons for doing so as his sister is in a bitter custody battle with her stalker ex-husband and he doesn't want her custodial rights jeopardized.  Meeting the emotionally bruised actor Blake though puts his secret in jeopardy as the attraction between them is instantaneous.  He understands Blake's pain and wants to help him but staying in the closet is a necessity that adds strain to a relationship just starting out.  While I can understand Jack's fears, especially in small town America, it still left me frustrated.  I also appreciated his seeing the real Blake behind the glitz and glamour that was the impetus to Blake's finally discovering what he really wanted out of life.There's a lot going on in this story with many characters coming and going that distracts a bit from the sweet and sensual relationship blossoming between Blake and Jack.  Their feelings about their sexuality sometimes became a bit too angsty and left me frustrated while still cheering them on as I liked both of them.  While the storyline involving Jack's sister was suspenseful it felt out of place amongst the charming, sweet, and sensual tone Ms. Harris set early on.  Overall though this was a quick read that fans of the m/m genre will find entertaining.3.75 STARS!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VU7F5DBLBLP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01094QJQU#wasThisHelpful","R3VU7F5DBLBLP2","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader obsessed with MC-themed romances I was thrilled to finally become acquainted with the Four Horseman MC and the sexy and compelling men and women who inhabit this exciting and sometimes stormy world.  Though I've not read the previous installments in this series I had no trouble getting quickly caught up in the dangerous past and unsettled future for the Club.  Once I reached the final page I couldn't wait to purchase the rest of the series as I became captivated by the exhilarating and dangerous world Ms. Rayne crafted.After deadly events long ago left their Club in ruins, current President Captain seems to have the Club flourishing with men surrounding him who he knows he can count on.  Beside him throughout the years offering support has been the older woman, and wife of the Club's long dead President, Eddie.  From the moment he saw Eddie he wanted her but Club honor held him back and had him marrying another but never giving up his attraction for her.  He's waited patiently for the right time to claim her and after being goaded by his Brothers that time is now.  It will be a difficult battle to earn her love though as he'll be fighting the memories she has of her dead husband as well as threats from rivals to the Club.  It all leads to moments of unrelenting sexual tension as well as pulse pounding and dangerous encounters that bring him and Eddie closer together despite all the reasons why she thinks they shouldn't find HEA.  Captain's a super sexy guy full of guilt over the past and worries over the Club's future.  He was only a Prospect when everything went so wrong for the Club and is determined not to let it happen again, but with their ongoing war with the Raptors and with an upcoming visit from the FBI, he's on edge.  He's always been drawn to Eddie but knew he couldn't have her, even now he's hesitant to claim her as he doesn't want it seen as a betrayal to the Club.  Being with her brings moments of peace and happiness, along with a fun, flirty, and playful side that he can't show as President.  I loved seeing him and Eddie together, their flirty banter and crackling sexual chemistry, and found their older woman/younger man connection believable and refreshing.Eddie may no longer be the official Queen Bee of the Club but she's a big part of its past and its future as the mother of current members.  Though she was devoted to her dead husband Joker she was always flattered by Captain's flirtations and couldn't help finding him sexy.  Now that she's free to accept his affections though she's torn over feelings of betrayal to Joker's memory as well as their age difference.  Her willpower will be tested as Captain unleashes a sensual onslaught that any woman would find hard to resist.  When her lucrative moonshine business captures the attention of rivals it will put her in extremely close quarters with Captain which allows them to explore years of pent-up feelings.  Once the dust settles nothing will ever be the same!This was an exciting thrill-ride from the first page to the last.  Though it's the fourth book in the series it definitely stands on its own as it nicely balances the sweet and sexy romance with Club machinations that has readers discovering what brought the MC down and what dangers loom on the horizon.  The main couple is immensely likable as they engage in their sensual battle of wills with a believable connection that's been years in the making.  Surrounding them is an equally likable and diverse cast of secondary characters that keep the action rolling along and that have me excited for the future as their personal lives play out amidst a background of increasing danger.  With an exciting cliffhanger ending readers will be left counting down the days until we return to Hell in this exhilarating and sensual series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPNAM8QWIQP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102KGSDA#wasThisHelpful","R1WPNAM8QWIQP8","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the emotional intensity of the previous installment in the Nashville Nights series, Redemption was a much more easygoing read with only one Big Misunderstanding to keep the likable and sweet and sexy main couple from their HEA.  From start to finish readers get a glimpse of a vividly depicted world of country music and the skyrocketing career of two people who find an unexpected connection when it comes to music and love.  Readers will find themselves fully invested in their career and burgeoning relationship and cheering when they hit the big time.Zane has always been seen as the sexy, tatted-up playboy of country music, always had a plan for becoming a famous solo singer.  He's a love 'em and leave 'em guy who's never been interested in commitment but since meeting his friend's, and the woman who made him her opening act, half-sister he's been left conflicted.  Being a player's never bothered him before but he doesn't want to betray the woman who's giving him the chance of a lifetime nor hurt the sweet, sexy, and talented young woman who brings him happiness and unconditional support.  Though he wanted to keep things casual with her he quickly gets caught up in their fiery connection and emotional musical collaborations that are gaining them fame.  Being with her has him chasing new dreams but reminders of the past have him saying hurtful things that will ultimately need a Grand Gesture to heal and that made me a bit misty-eyed.  Zane is charming and sexy and he's also got a playful side that's endearing.  Being with Emory brought out his romantic side too as seen through their first sexual encounter that was full of hearts and flowers.  His interactions with Emory crackled with electricity from their very first meeting with sexual interludes that became hotter as they grew closer.  Their banter too was flirty and fun and gave extra zing to their romance.Emory's a sweet girl who always wanted to leave home for the chance at something more.  After discovering her half-sister's a famous country singer she sets out to reconnect with Kit but soon finds herself caught up in a steamy romance with a super sexy bad boy.  Together they make beautiful music on and off the stage until hurtful words pull them apart.  Will Emory be able to forgive Zane or will this be the day their love song comes to an end?  Emory was a likable heroine and you could see the sisterly bond slowly evolve between her and Kit throughout the story which made for some heartwarming moments.  She was strong-willed and quick to offer quiet comfort and support when needed as seen during Zane's reunion with his father.  She's open with her feelings, forthright, and stuck up for herself despite the pain it caused her which left me cheering as she made Zane work in his efforts to gain her forgiveness.From start to finish this was a sweet and super sexy read and a very good addition to the Nashville Nights series.  The main characters were immensely likable as well as the secondary ones, both treasured favorites from previous series installments along with entertaining new faces that have me excited for the next installment.  The romance between Zane and Emory was erotic yet allowed to grow emotionally outside of the bedroom through their musical collaborations.  The intricacies of the music world and the physically draining yet exhilarating touring schedules were vividly depicted too and pulled me even further into the story and the outcome of this sparkling duo.  Emory was a worthy heroine who I liked from the very start.  Zane was appealing as a player but became even more so as the quintessential hero who found love and was willing to do anything to get it back.  This was a nicely crafted romance with only a bit of angst which makes this a decadent summer read to take you away from it all!4.5 STARS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190DSCX1IGDNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH4T7NE#wasThisHelpful","R190DSCX1IGDNF","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader unfamiliar with the Billionaires in the City series I was worried that not reading the previous installments would detract from my enjoyment of this story.  I'm happy to report though that this is a fun and flirty read with a nice bit of suspense that can definitely stand on its own.In the aftermath of Joslyn Devaroux's attempted murder of wealthy businesswoman Victoria Green, heiress Emma Devaroux and security specialist Jace Lance are brought together under a veil of deceit that could destroy their burgeoning relationship before it's barely begun.  Throw in a bit of suspense courtesy of the machinations of Emma's sister Joslyn and her hired thug David and you have the impetus that binds Jace and Emma together despite her anger at his perceived betrayal.  Told in alternating POVs readers are given a glimpse into both of the main character's lives which had me finding them likable and enjoying their increasingly steamy romance.Emma could've lived up to the stereotype of the snobby rich girl but she was anything but.  She was determined and strong-willed and gave as good as she got when it came to Jace.  With his military background Jace was a loyal man, torn between his initial duty to Victoria and later on to Emma's cousins.  Ultimately, as his feelings for Emma grew deeper, he became her champion protecting her from Joslyn's manipulations.  Jace and Emma might've started off adversaries but with the danger increasing their interactions became crackling with fun and flirty banter leading to steamy interludes.Overall this was an entertaining story with appealing characters that made for an engaging and suspenseful tale from start to finish.  Though there were some plot holes, some silly choices made by characters, and a few unanswered questions at the end, Ms. Crowe's writing style fully immersed me in the story and pulled me along every step of the way.  Readers looking for a sexy read with a bit of intrigue will want to add this to their bookshelf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDZF6TIXERN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8CETHO#wasThisHelpful","R2CDZF6TIXERN8","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who goes through book boyfriends like Kleenex I finally found one that will be hard to forget courtesy of Ms. March!  Lord, oh Lord, is he one sexy tatted-up pseudo-bad boy!  He grew up in a world of rough people and rougher circumstances.  Everything he's gotten in life he's had to work for or fight for.  It's all left him a bit untrusting and a whole lot of jaded.  Behind his gruffness though beats the heart of a loyal and caring man and it all adds up to one drool-worthy package.  The day he fires a worker for stealing changes his life irrevocably as rich girl Elle walks through the door demanding a job.  He's always been attracted to her but doesn't want to ruin his connection to his brother by lovin' and leavin' the best friend of his brother's girlfriend.  With her so close every day, and danger coming ever closer to his front door, he can't help but give in to the temptation though.  He's not interested in a one-night stand like most bad boys, but instead sets out to woo her in a sensual battle of wills that had me falling for him with every turn of the page.  He's sexy but sweet, caring and willing to fight for those he cares for.  His interactions with troubled teen Mathieu especially shows off his caring side.  His interactions with Elle are scorching and ultimately lead to lots of steamy encounters that are sensual and playful.  From start to finish he completely owned me.Elle's the stereotypical rich girl living large and trying to find a way to annoy her parents.  Working at the pawn shop Chains seems like just the thing to annoy her family and gives her the extra joy of flirting with a truly sexy and compelling bad boy.  She's not ready for a commitment-minded Lord though as she's just looking for fun.  After seeing her mother become controlled by her step-father and seek refuge in alcohol, she wants no part of belonging to another.  It's a merry chase she gets led on though by the determined Lord that finally has her caving in a richly rewarding way.  When a battle between gangs, and a return of her past, collide she'll need Lord's strength more than ever.  Elle's a strong-willed character who gives as good as she gets.  She tells it like it is and fights for what she wants.  For so long she's been judged on a superficial level but Lord shows her her true worth in some very sexy ways.  When danger rears its ugly head her and Lord make a formidable team as their sexual connection solidifies into something stronger.From the first page to the last readers are taken on a sensual and suspenseful journey where the danger and romance are perfectly balanced.  Lord is delectable and Elle his spunky temptation.  Their first meeting is electric with every encounter thereafter crackling with sensuality and flirty banter.  The side character of Mathieu brings wonderful humor to the story too and I long to see more of him.  My only issue is the lack of deep talks and moments where Lord and Elle could find out more about each other.  Their sexual connection is obvious but I wanted more.  Ultimately though, readers looking for an exciting and sexy thrill ride, with no angst or big misunderstandings, will want to add this deliciously decadent book to their bookshelf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNG287EGPBBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YKT7OAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CNG287EGPBBE","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Loving on the Edge series continues to captivate with this tale of reunited friends to lovers and the tumultuous journey to HEA between two men from very different worlds.  With Ms. Loren's impeccable storytelling it's easy to get caught up in this story and its immensely likable main characters who finally find happiness once they finally start living their lives for themselves.  Though the characters haven't had an impact on the sensual world honed through the previous seven books I still found myself rooting for them and feeling immense satisfaction once the final page was turned.Hunter Riley is the Golden Boy son of a Senator whose life is ruled by his father's money, demands, and bullying.  He longs to be a different person though, a less rigid and less judgemental person and becomes that at a college thousands of miles from home.  His befriending of his gay fraternity brother opens his eyes to living life on your own terms, but also complicates things as their close friendship leads to matters of the heart.  Flash forward four years, and with his life feeling progressively stifling, he knows he can no longer keep the past in the past which leads to a night of eye-opening words and deeds.  Through everything Hunter's immensely likable and I enjoyed seeing his and Devon's connection blossom from playful friends to an intense connection not easily defined.  Only with Dev did he feel carefree and I ached for all the years he wasted being tied in knots.Devon was a strong-willed character with a big personality and exotic looks from the first moment we saw him.  After being kicked out of his home for being gay he took on the care of his sister and supported her in her rise to fame in the music world.  He forged his own path never caring what people thought but was grateful for the wholehearted acceptance Hunter gave him along with a sense of family for the care and support between them.  Their love was unspoken but clearly present at every turn which had me rooting for them every step of the way.  Dev was understandably angry over all the wasted years but I was completely won over by their reunion after seeing the loving foundation that was laid years before.Overall this book was a pleasant diversion as it doesn't have much impact in the overall Loving on the Edge universe.  With its likable main couple and sweet and sexy storyline though it was a decadent delight that again shows why I celebrate each new book Ms. Loren puts out.  With its steamy m/m lovin' and sweetly sentimental and heartwarming journey to HEA, all lovers of romance will want to add this to their bookshelf!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3J1IZQ073M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USMCMYW#wasThisHelpful","RJ3J1IZQ073M2","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader obsessed with MC-themed books, the Sinner's Tribe series has been a compelling and sexy thrill ride thus far and has me looking forward to more from these protective and loyal bad boy bikers.  This installment picks up a short time after the previous book ended and puts us right back into the middle of a war between the Sinners and the Black Jacks where the body count keeps mounting, loyalties are put to the test, and danger is around every corner.  Into this turf war love might become the biggest casualty though as the ultimate playboy Cade fights to keep the struggling single mother Dawn safe from her cruel ex and her own brutal biker past.Cade's always been seen as a playboy, never content with just one woman after seeing his own mother's devotion to his father lead to her death.  He's never wanted to open his heart as love is seen as a weakness in his world but he can't help being drawn to Dawn.  After just two nights he knew he had to have more of her, if only he can convince her that not all bikers are bad.  Her past ties to the MC world complicates things though as he's forced into choosing between his Club and his newfound love and revenge for all the hurts she's suffered.  Cade's torn between wanting to keep Dawn safe and be true to the Club that saved him when he returned home from war emotionally bruised and broken which had me feeling sympathy for him with his divided loyalties.  Despite the complications that being with Dawn represents she brings out all the secrets he's kept hidden, he becomes unburdened and carefree in her presence.  Being with Dawn's children also brings out a softer side to him that was endearing and had him slowly realizing how special belonging to one person can be.  His romantic battle with Dawn was full of sexual tension, emotional intensity, and unexpected twists and turns that proved that bad boy bikers need love too.Dawn's life went downhill the day her parents died.  Living on the streets led to choices she's still ashamed to admit to, but her biggest mistake was thinking that Jimmy ""Mad Dog"" was her savior.  Leaving him though has made her life even more miserable as his manipulations led to her daughters being taken from her and given to his sister who's increasing monetary demands lead to more danger for everyone involved.  Dawn's heart and soul belongs to her daughters and she's desperate to get them back but Cade is a delectable distraction that culminates in numerous hot and heavy interludes.  He soon becomes her only hope in getting her girls back, but is she willing to put her heart on the line for the promise of family she sees in his eyes?  Dawn is a strong-willed woman who's very untrusting which left me frustrated as Cade never did anything while committed to Dawn that would cause her to doubt him.  After everything's she's been through she swears to never be controlled by anyone again but lets herself be continually manipulated when it comes to her daughters.  Considering how strong and sure Cade is I was hoping the woman he fell for would be the same but some of Dawn's actions left me frustrated.  I could forgive her though as I enjoyed the softer and more caring side she brought out in Cade.This was an exciting addition to the gritty and pulse-pounding Sinner's Tribe series with more danger heading towards the Club's front door.  Love and loyalty are put to the test which led to some hard choices that left everyone a bit bruised.  Cade is a great hero showing a sweet and sexy side along with a dark and deadly side that was equally appealing.  Dawn's a survivor and admirable but still has a ways to go before she becomes as independent as the previous installment's heroine, Arianne.  I loved the glimpses of the other Sinners as each is more compelling than the next with their dark and mysterious pasts being hinted at throughout each book in the series.  On a whole it's the men who rule in this world and why I'm drawn to this series.  These are men who are loyal to the lucky women who capture their attention and I look forward to the next Sinner finding heaven.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27A8QSMY4VY84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5F8WYQ#wasThisHelpful","R27A8QSMY4VY84","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not having read the previous books in the Through Hell and Back series I wasn't prepared for the emotional impact this book started off with.  But boy, what a heartbreaking start to a story that's ultimately satisfying and immensely happy.  The journey to get to that HEA though was a tough one through these three books but definitely worthwhile.Brandon and his two foster brothers have been put through the emotional wringer, lost without one another, after circumstances cruelly tore them apart.  With a past that's kept him in hiding it's now time to come into the light as the brothers are finally reunited.  Brandon's also reunited with the doctor who treated him through his darkest period and their connection is instantaneous.  Neither a 12-year age difference nor the emotional wall Tash has built after losing his lover will keep Brandon from claiming him.  The wall Tash has built is indeed heavy as he doesn't want to open his heart to pain again and has convinced himself that he doesn't need anyone.  It sounds predictable but in Ms. Stevens hands it all worked for me.All this could've made for a perfect romance but we're more often told rather than shown their burgeoning relationship.  Though their chemistry was electric we didn't get to experience that fully.  Too often the emotional reunion between the brothers, and all the issues surrounding it, overshadowed the romance and put it on the back burner.  There were so many twists, turns, and emotions to deal with that left little time for Brandon and Tash to shine.  That's not to say that I was unhappy though as the brothers and their newly created families were a heartwarming sight.  With this book all the storylines came full circle and were tied up with a big bow.  The epilogue was pure perfection, leaving a smile on reader's faces, and is richly rewarding to those who've been with these brothers since book one.3.5 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9F8AYS1LD7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB43WX8#wasThisHelpful","R1I9F8AYS1LD7V","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through three books Ms. Bennett has crafted an incredibly entertaining and emotionally intense series set in the hockey world and featuring one delectable hero after another.  After a traumatic car accident in the previous installment of the Cold Fury series leaves Zack injured and his girlfriend, and mother of his child, dead he's left to pick up the pieces and make a new life for himself and his son Ben.  It's not an easy journey though, and sometimes his guilt and anger come to the forefront, but through it all he's surrounded by a supportive and immensely likable cast of characters who add to this story's enjoyment.After spending the last few months physically recovering, Zack's ready to get back on the ice, the only place he feels comfortable from the emotions weighing on him.  In anticipation of that he's got to find someone to take care of his son while he's on the road which has the nerdy yet perpetually positive Kate showing up on his doorstep.  Since the accident he's felt numb with his only focus on his son, but Kate quickly engenders something else in him....  First it's guilt over seeing another woman care for his son and then he feels unfaithful as Kate's sweet yet sensual nature has him finally feeling desire for another.  He has no intention of committing to her though as he doesn't want to again open his heart and mind to the pain.  Her kindheartedness, honesty, and intriguing personality challenge him to keep things just about sex in a subtle tug of war he wages with himself that has him lashing out occasionally.  Throughout his journey I was drawn to Zack as his feelings of guilt and loss were understandable.  He hated that Gina wasn't the woman he wanted to marry but he felt like he owed it to her.  Kate seemed to be a great match for him and I was sad that he couldn't totally embrace what she was offering without big heartache.  I loved seeing him interact with Ben as it showed a truly kind and loving person and it gave me hope that he'd finally open his heart to Kate.Kate was a delightful heroine, perhaps my favorite in the series thus far.  She was a bit nerdy, a bit plain in her appearance, but humorous and always positive and forgiving.  She had a hard life growing up with no money and an alcoholic father who she still loved wholeheartedly.  Money may have been tight but she's a survivor making her way on her own which made her admirable and deserving of a HEA.  She blossomed early which garnered her attention she didn't want which has her continuing to hide behind baggy clothes, thick framed glasses, and wearing her hair in a bun.  Zack is one of the first men to truly see her which has her seeing herself in a new way that made her even more strong-willed.  While she wants to be the one to save Zack she'll have to save her heart as their connection becomes even more complicated.  Will Kate finally break through Zack's emotional walls or will he forever wallow in guilt?  From the first moment we see Kate she's fun-loving and full of life and embraces living wholeheartedly that you can't help but smile when she's on the scene.  Her interactions with Ben are loving, playful, and immensely endearing.  When with Zack their sexual tension is off-the-charts, playful and sexy, and worth the emotional battle Zack's going through.From start to finish this was a story that easily immerses you.  From the immensely likable main characters to the secondary characters who we'e come to know through the previous installments.  I loved revisiting the old characters, especially Olivia as we find out how her cancer treatment's going.  I don't normally like children in romances but Ben was adorable and realistic in his words and deeds too.  Along with strong emotions at play, we see vividly detailed hockey scenes that were exciting and showed Zack at his most carefree.  I also enjoyed getting to know the new addition to the Cold Fury, Ryker, the aging hockey star who's been betrayed by love too.  It all made for a great read that was both sexy and heartwarming and that has me excited for the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HX98ZNRB3X6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OX5C#wasThisHelpful","R17HX98ZNRB3X6","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of stories with techno elements and life or death circumstances will be drawn to this series starter and the characters readers are just starting to get to know.  Though the narrative is a bit rough and choppy at times the overall story arc is compelling and this tale full of intrigue.Roy and his team feel as if they're losing the fight against a group of genetically engineered men until he stumbles across a woman with unique talents running from a past not of her own making.  He's immediately drawn to her despite the danger surrounding her and they grow closer as she becomes an integral part of his team.  Roy's still reeling from the loss of his wife though, as well as teammates, and doesn't want to open his heart but the vulnerability of the woman named Glory has him unwilling to let her go despite the danger.  His caring side is balanced with his knowledge of what she could bring to their battle with his care and concern coming to the forefront to do whatever necessary to keep her safe.  Into the fray they both charge though in an attempt to save others like her which puts both of them in danger in a pulse-pounding finale that leaves his heart wide open.Glory can't remember anything from her childhood no matter how hard she tries to breach her memory.  What she does know is that she has remarkable abilities crafted in a petri dish that leave her treated like a lab rat with no rights.  When a near-rape leads to an unexpected complication she's forced on the run and luckily straight into Roy's arms.  Glory's naive with very little knowledge of the outside world despite her intelligence.  It leaves her ill-equipped for the harshness and loneliness outside the compound which has her wanting to cling to Roy despite the danger to him.  Together she teaches him new and deadly talents while she learns about love.  Glory starts off shy and scared but being with Roy has her gaining and desiring even more independence.  I enjoyed seeing her grow and gain confidence in her connection with Roy that simmered from the moment they met.  They ultimately made a formidable couple as they tried to save the women she called sister.This was a story that was a bit slow for the first half but once it got going it packed in a lot of action as it raced to a thrilling conclusion that sets up even more intrigue for the next installment.  The main couple were likable with a relationship that felt a bit clunky at first as trust issues ran deep but grew more romantic the closer they grew.  There were numerous secondary characters who readers are just getting a glimpse at here but who will play bigger roles as the series progresses.  Though it's theme is familiar there's still much to like in this story with its danger, suspense, and subtle romance that will leave readers wanting more.3.5 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4IU0623Q79C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXAL2BC#wasThisHelpful","RP4IU0623Q79C","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader whose favorite part of romance novels is the hero, I found Damon the quintessential hero as he waited years to claim the one woman he knew to be his.  Though he came from a childhood of abuse and unfathomable neglect he rose above all that to become a man you can count on for his loyalty and honesty.  He may have once been a bully as a child in acting out against the pain his father heaped on him, but meeting Willa brought out all his protective instincts as they became forever inseparable.  While everyone else thought they were dating he was too scared to admit his feelings for fear their closeness would end if she didn't feel the same.  When outside forces force him to admit the truth though their close friendship will never be the same.  Their newfound connection becomes even more complicated when his past comes back to haunt him with a darkness that might finally overpower him.  Damon's a sweet character very different from the typical romance hero in that he's a virgin.  It was endearing seeing him and Willa grow closer through charmingly awkward sexual interludes at the start of their newly-defined relationship.  Readers get a glimpse into what he suffered as a child and it's heartbreaking, but seeing how much he's overcome makes him even more admirable.While I adored the hero, I had some issues with Willa.  As a 23 year old woman she tended to act more like a child.  She was fearful of everything, emotionally broke when confronted with negativity, while secrets and surprises left her hyperventilating.  I kept expecting there to be a reason in her past for this but I didn't see that here.  Everyone knew she had these problems but instead of getting her help they fed into it.  While she was full of child-like naveté though, she was a truly kindhearted person whose cheery outlook Damon needed to overcome the darkness of his childhood.  Willa loved Damon unconditionally and once she committed to him it was completely, which made their new relationship move very quickly and in a very mature direction.Along with a memorable main couple there was a large cast of secondary characters to interfere in Damon and Willa's relationship, which they often did with little regard to their feelings.  There were numerous familial interactions to show the importance of family, especially to Damon who had only his vile father as a role model.  His wonder and love for all the chaos made me ache for him all the more and happy for the peace and contentment that Willa brought him despite my feelings for her.  His interactions with his male friends also added a bit of humor to a sweet story with very intense feelings at times.  The story may have started out slow but a face from Damon's past makes for a fast-paced conclusion full of pulse-pounding fear.  While this return felt a bit jarring, it did add a bit of much-needed excitement to a story that didn't have much conflict.  While this story can be read on its own the familial connections and long-simmering love between two connected souls will be more richly rewarding reading the other books in The Baby Saga first.  Fans of sweet yet sensual romances will find themselves charmed by this tale and its drool-worthy hero and will soon want to take a trip to Willow Creek!3.5 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129T6DBJ49FV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y4EIKS2#wasThisHelpful","R129T6DBJ49FV0","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not having read the first installment in the Storm Siren Trilogy I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this book, but with a friend's quick recap I felt ready for whatever this book would throw at me.  Fans of YA and fantasy reads will ultimately find this a compelling read and as a debut series it's well-paced with admirable characters and a storyline full of twists and turns.  With the character of Nym I was often reminded of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and found a heroine worth rooting for....as will you.After the heartbreaking cliffhanger in Storm Siren, Nym has been left bruised but not broken.  With new friends, and old enemies, Nym continues to remain strong as she struggles to keep the peace between the nations as well as discovering what the villain Draewulf's plans are.  Her journey is full of twists and turns that have her making rash decisions at times that frustrated me but her reasoning behind them made sense.  Aiding her in her journey is Rasha, her bold new friend who supports her unconditionally and Myles, who left me intrigued and conflicted as he always puts himself first but shows surprising support when you least expect it.  Nym will need all the support she can get as she's being tested more than ever as she fights a dark magic brewing inside her.Though this story was a bit confusing at first I quickly became immersed in the magic and suspense, though the overall themes were nothing groundbreaking.  Ms. Weber's world-building further immersed me as it nicely balanced the different magics and added to an already foreboding feeling regarding Draewulf's plans.  Though this is a Christian-based story I didn't notice any overt ideology which I greatly appreciated.  Readers looking for an edge of your seat read with a subtle yet heartbreaking romance and compelling heroine will want to add this series to their bookshelf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MUU3PI7E58L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWOH8LS#wasThisHelpful","R21MUU3PI7E58L","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a premise both compelling and timely comes this m/m romance of opposites attracting.  From very different personalities to very different upbringings, the romance between Russian hockey player Nik and flashy American ice skater Emory is one full of ups and downs along with danger from outside forces.  Through it all readers will be drawn to the ever optimistic Em while tearing up over the constant degradation heaped on Nik by those who should love him unconditionally.  It all adds up to an intensely emotional tale of self-discovery, societal issues, and familial expectations that kept me fully immersed in its highs and lows from the first page to the last.Emory is an immensely talented ice skater whose talent has always been overshadowed by his theatrics.  These theatrics are a deep-rooted part of him as he's an out and proud young man on the road to the Olympics.  Though staying focused is very important at this time, meeting his new neighbor has him easily distracted and embarking on a relationship that will profoundly change him, his family, and his new love.  With parents that have always protected him from the harshness that prejudice creates, it's while attending the Olympics that he comes face to face with hatred which bruises his strong sense of self leaving him to find himself once again.  By his side during this trying time is his closeted lover Nik who, with all his familial baggage, adds to his confusion but binds that even closer together as love does conquer all.  Emory's a delightful character quick with a smile and long on dramatics.  You can't help but be charmed by him even when frustrated by his over-the-top theatrics that continually put him in danger.  His strong will is to be admired and every scene he was in put a smile on my face as his exuberance and joy in being himself is infectious.Whereas Emory is a bundle of joy, Nik is darker and full of self-doubts.  His life has never truly been his own as his father Igor controlled every aspect of it, including his thoughts and his plans for the future.  Nik was never allowed to step out of line as physical and verbal abuse was the price to pay for defiance.  At the start of the story Nik's views are tainted by his father's which had him spewing lots of racial slurs.  Getting to know Emory though, and growing closer to him, gave Nik the strength to finally stand up for himself and start living his life by his own rules.  It's a difficult journey of self-discovery as new feelings arise in him, his father's rage takes a more dangerous turn, and his increasing fears regarding how society will view him as he desperately wants to succeed in hockey eat away at him.  It's an emotionally draining journey that's dark at times but ultimately uplifting.  With Emory by his side he feels a sense of peace and support from Em and his family that he's never known before that gives him the impetus to embrace who and what he wants out of life.  It's a cheer-inducing moment as he finally stands up for himself and it felt like a weight had been lifted off him as well as readers.Em is a larger than life character, and while I liked Nik, he paled in comparison whenever Em was near.  Their romance started off a bit aggressively as Em's flirtations were a bit energetic which made Nik's uncertainty understandable.  Their connection soon morphed into friends then lovers in a sweet and sensual journey of discovery with Em supporting Nik every step of the way.  With all the turmoil in their lives I was delighted with the Lowe family and their unerring support of Em and then Nik.  Tim Lowe is the perfect father with his sage advice and humorous talks regarding relationships.  He treated Nik as a son which was an endearing act after everything Nik had gone through.  The scenes revolving around the sports of ice skating and hockey were vividly and accurately depicted and left my pulse pounding with their intensity.  The only thing to mar my enjoyment of this story was the over-the-top antics of Igor.  With an act reminiscent of the Tanya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan debacle the storyline became a bit soap opera-ish with Igor's increasing hatred growing more out of control and distracting to the romance and message of the story.  On a whole though I found this a memorable read with its themes of acceptance, support, and love and recommend it to readers wanting an empowering yet romanctic tale where love conquers all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSRO240V9F1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWW3DAC#wasThisHelpful","RRSRO240V9F1W","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The stakes are getting higher and the danger growing ever closer to Star after bad boy biker Noah takes her in payment for another's betrayal.  Things aren't that clear-cut though as Star's been looking for an escape from a life becoming more oppressive and Noah's isn't as bad as he first appears.  While this installment is a bit darker than the previous we get to see deeper into Star and Noah's souls and to the better lives they're desperate for but doubt they'll ever have.  For now they'll take what they can in a story full of game-changers.Star is a sweet girl caught up in dark and dangerous things beyond her control.  She longs for excitement and for someone to care for her and sees those possibilities in Noah.  Being with him though means embracing some of the darker things in life which leave her questioning her heart, soul, and beliefs of good and bad.  Through it all though I admired her strength and her ability to survive everything happening to her now and in her childhood.Noah's a very strong-willed man who believes in what his MC once was but is slowly discovering how twisted it's become.  He's still extremely loyal to his MC but meeting Star leaves his loyalties divided and committing an act that will change everyone's future.  Amongst all the darkness surrounding him in this installment I treasured the quiet times that gave us a glimpse at the man behind the patch.  He's a man with wants and dreams that he knows he can never have so he'll hold tight to the one bright spot in his life right now...Star.  Readers learn a bit about his family, especially his wayward sister whose disappearance leaves us screaming in frustration for a cliffhanger with huge ramifications.This story had a faster pace than the previous with a lot more sexual intensity.  Noah and Star crackle with electricity whenever they're together with his claim on her more than apparent.  The head of the MC, Dev, is a truly vile villain whose nefarious plans leave the club in the middle of a battle for revenge with the body count just starting to add up.  Noah's friend Stone leaves a lasting impression with his rough attitude and flashes of true caring and support for his friend and Star and I hope to see more of him.  All-in-all this was an exhilarating thrill ride full of twists and turns and intense sensuality that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I'm now left counting down the days until the next book in this dark, gritty, and sexy serial.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRV8KM7D221S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTWIG6C#wasThisHelpful","RLRV8KM7D221S","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Into the crowded m/m genre comes this debut story of three young college men drawn together in support, understanding, and love.  As a debut work the premise immediately draws you in but the execution is a bit rough around the edges, the flow a bit choppy, and some of the actions a bit lacking in believability.  It shows great promise though with its likable characters and thoughtful handling of serious social issues.Pretty yet emotionally damaged Francis has left home along with a painful past of abuse, ostracization, and betrayal behind.  Arriving at a small college he just wants peace, quiet, and to be left alone in anonymity.  His arrival though catches the interest of the sweet and kindhearted closeted football player Andrew and the snarky and confident hockey player Sebastian, who wage a subtle battle to claim his battered heart.  Francis may start out timid and unsure but the attentions and support of these two sexy men, along with the support of two other memorable friends, has him coming out of hiding and taking what he wants when it comes to Andrew and Sebastian despite what others think.  Even when his past comes back to haunt him in an over-the-top and questionable way, his newfound family have his back in a way not usually seen in college-aged people.Andrew is a sweet and understanding soul hiding his sexuality for fear of his future in football.  Meeting Francis though has him divulging all, including his affections, soon after meeting him in a moment of insta-love.  It made him a bit one-dimensional and too good to be true at times.  Sebastian has a bit more depth as he struggles with his feelings.  He's always been fluid in his sexuality but never wanted to commit until meeting Francis, but once he does he does so wholeheartedly.  Into this tight-knit circle readers also get to know the outspoken Heather who tells it like it is and protects those she cares about with sharp language and angry glares.  The final member of The Gang is the nerdy John who can always be counted on for humor and easing of awkward moments.  Coming from no friends at all, Francis now has a large group of supporters that he'll need as an unscrupulous reporter comes poking into his new life and jealousy and prejudice have others trying to hurt him and those he cares about.On a whole this was an entertaining story with likable characters.  The actions and dialogue didn't always ring true though.  At times the characters talked too maturely and flowery that pulled me out of the story.  The romance between Francis, Andrew, and Sebastian was sweet with bits of sensuality but the culmination of their affections was a bit extreme considering everything Francis had been through in the past.  Readers looking for a new voice in this genre though will want to keep an eye on Mr. LeFey as this work left me wanting more.3.5 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYMUJ28CAULK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W814OUQ#wasThisHelpful","RYYMUJ28CAULK","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who enjoy watching opposites attract will be drawn to the complex relationship between veterinarian Connor and rich boy Ash in this sweet and sensual read.  Over the course of one summer these two men will find themselves at crossroads that will not only push them together but pull them apart as they discover who they really are and what they really want.  The quietness of village life is the backdrop to this relationship that is antagonistic at first but slowly becomes more profound as they deal with their pasts, prejudices, and expectations and readers will find themselves quickly caught up in the drama.As a youngster Connor's sweetest memories were of summers spent at a cottage in Upper Fordham and it's where he came to heal after a very painful relationship left him bruised and battered inside and out.  This painful past also left him fearful, doubtful of his feelings, and prejudice against those with money.  His existence now revolves around his vet work and the very small group he allows into his heart...the sweet Rachel and the wise old man who owns the cottage that has always represented happiness, safety, and love.  At first this all seemed fulfilling enough but meeting rich boy Ash has his heart racing and his hormones awakening.  His fear and anger weigh heavily on him though and it takes a lot for Ash to finally break through his emotional walls but the journey is one that shows Ash in an unexpected way and has Connor growing stronger within himself and healing from the past.  I enjoyed seeing Connor come out of his shell as he's a truly kindhearted person who deserved some goodness after being betrayed.  His emotions were believable and had me aching for him early on but smiling as he and Ash grew closer.Ashby comes from a well-established and wealthy family and with that comes many expectations that are slowly smothering him.  He's always been the fun-loving brother flitting from one short-lived relationship to the next but meeting Connor has him wanting something more.  At first he just enjoys the challenge but as they spend more time together he discovers a more meaningful bond forming between them.  Getting rid of Connor's preconceived notions has Ash discovering things about himself he didn't want to admit before, but wanting Connor has him embracing the more mundane things in life that are more fulfilling to him.  Throughout his own journey of self-discovery he and Connor grow closer in a relationship that starts out sweet and slow but quickly combusts in sexy and playful encounters.  From start to finish I found Ash an enjoyable, larger-than-life character who was utterly charming.  He wasn't afraid to go after Connor and that carried over into his embracing of a new stage in his life that was far more rewarding for him.Though this story was very slow at the start it allowed the romance to progress in a believable way as Connor and Ash morphed from enemies to friends to lovers.  The narrative sometimes got caught up in the history of the town too which left me clamoring for them to finally get together.  When they finally gave in though it was a richly rewarding moment that was sweet, steamy, and playful.  With two strong lead characters there was an equally memorable cast of secondary characters that were charming and supportive.  The depictions of the quaintness of the town and its denizens created a safe and idyllic environment from which these characters could find themselves without judgement.  The brotherly interactions between Ash, Ben, and Landon were also heartwarming and showed a different side to Ash that gave us our first glimpse of the substance behind his style.  Ultimately Connor and Ash had a lot of intense personal baggage to work through and I found myself captivated by their journey and recommend this to fans of the m/m genre and all lovers of romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZUJ4RNH3DFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YF8QIH2#wasThisHelpful","RFZUJ4RNH3DFG","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since the release of the first book in the Portland Heat series, Ms. Albert's talent has become clearer with each successive book.  On a whole this is a series defined by its storylines and characters that has given me hours of enjoyment.  With this latest installment though, my favorite of the three, I was given a sweet and memorable read with characters who jumped off the page as they claimed my heart.  Though the emotions being dealt with here were intense the action never devolved into uber-angst nor went over-the-top, the characters and their feelings remained human which fully immersed me in the story from the very first page to the last.Upon getting our first glimpse of college student Lance in his Uncle Vic's story he'd left an indelible impression with his exuberance for life, perpetual optimism, and fun and flirty nature.  In this romantic tale Lance shows that he's wise beyond his years as he subtly tries to get the reserved and overly serious Chris to look past age and focus on the love growing from their friends with benefits relationship.  Lance was immediately drawn to Chris but had to work to gain entrance into his life because of Chris' fears over age and lost dreams.  Lance ultimately had to wage a battle of charm, playfulness, and sensuality that was immensely entertaining before Chris finally gave in with a scorching one-night stand that caught both of them off guard.  Their burgeoning relationship was sweet yet sexy and despite their plan to keep things casual their connection reached surprising depths with Lance opening Chris' eyes to living life instead of hiding away.  He was clearly more in touch with his feelings and willing to put his heart on the line to make their relationship work long-term which, combined with his upbeat and open aiitude, kept a perpetual smile on my face.Chris has been hurt numerous times in the past and had his dreams crushed repeatedly.  It's left him weary and afraid to put his heart on the line again.  With an ex-boyfriend whose existence irritates him and with his life passing him by he feels jaded, but seeing Lance awakens his heart and has him wanting to bask in the sunlight of Lance's soul.  Though he can think of many reasons why they shouldn't be a couple, which are discussed throughout the story, Chris can't deny how good they are together.  Being with Lance has him embracing life once again, it has him reaching for new possibilities, and finding fulfillment in making others happy by opening his heart.  With the clock ticking down until Lance leaves for grad school, will Chris go back to being alone or will he take a chance on love?This story had a wonderful flow which allowed Lance and Chris' closeness to evolve believably.  Though lust drew them together initially, things quickly grew more serious through heartfelt conversations and Lance's charm and big heart.  Chris was a broken man just going through the motions until Lance came into his life and I loved seeing Chris evolve into a more kindhearted and self-sacrificing person.  Though the emotions were intense there was very little angst, and difficulties that arose were dealt with quickly and maturely.  Along with a strong personal connection between them were numerous hot and heavy scenes that were at times playful but always sensual.  These scenes were nicely balanced though with interactions outside the bedroom which showed the fun and flirty banter growing between them.  On a whole this was a well-crafted story with an immensely likable main couple.  There were very few extraneous characters to get in the way of the wonderful relationship burning between Lance and Chris which meant plenty of time spent in their hearts and minds to fully immerse me in their chosen endings.  Fans of the m/m genre will fall in love with Lance just as much as I did and will easily get caught up in this older man/younger man romance with surprising depth and emotions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9E5VCKDVLO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR7AA#wasThisHelpful","R1F9E5VCKDVLO1","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who like their romances steamy and full of angst and unexpected twists and turns will get just that with this collection of books that takes us on an intense journey starting in college amidst an eclectic group of friends.  For Carina, college opens her eyes to many things and introduces her to Jaxon, the player who never seems able to commit but leaves a lasting impression on Carina's life as he always seems a part of it.  Carina's new roommate Desirae leaves a lasting impression as well with her outspoken nature and her ability to recover from being betrayed.  Readers see their lives, and others in their unconventional family, progress from friends to lovers through pain to happiness where their HEAs are never certain and sometimes unconventional.  Through it all though the characters remain unique and realistic in their occasional poor choices that sometimes left me frustrated.  These characters may not always be popular in their actions but they do own up to them.  By the end of the journey individual HEAs are hard-won with readers feeling like they've been put through the wringer.There's a lot going on in this collection, almost too much at times with so many storylines being juggled.  It's an all-encompassing journey though with the various stories being told, the inclusion of deleted scenes, and a brand new work to round out the set with varying degrees of success.  All the stories have a nice flow with intense emotions on display to fully immerse you into the character's lives.  Each work is heavy on the sexuality with numerous kinds of games being played and couplings represented which for the most part add to the narrative.  It was only with the book Yearning that I felt things were a bit too gratuitous, but I could overlook that as the story gave us insight into the sexy Valentino and Marco, and their growing connection to Carina.  My favorite of this collection was Reverence as it highlights Desirae as she fights her feelings for Carina's brother Diego.  Desirae's strength is again on display through her being a Dom which shows her as a survivor.  Diego is the quintessential hero who I completely fell for as he was willing to do and become whatever Desirae needed from him.Ultimately this collection left me drained....but in a good way.  The character's paths to HEA were all rocky, never taking the expected path.  It was intense on every level which made for a memorable reading experience that I definitely recommend to fans of erotica as the balance between steam and substance was well-crafted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXCCN9E87HND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU9WBOI#wasThisHelpful","R2UXCCN9E87HND","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of the m/m genre, along with paranormal reads, this book offered a lot in its premise.  While reading it fulfilled some of the promise it gave, I was left frustrated as well.  From the very first page I felt that I was missing out on what set these shifters apart from others.  The idea of life mates isn't very clear either and just assumed.  In this tale of insta-love though that assumption is needed as alpha-shifter Chandler, a man with many one-night stands, falls for the sweet and sexually naive Evan.  Theirs is a rocky journey to HEA as Evan's criminal past comes back to put him and his newfound happiness in jeopardy.Chandler is the head of his family after the deaths of his parents.  He never saw a life mate in his future, especially after his chosen mating with another man left him cold.  His brother's recent discovery of his own life mate though puts Chandler in close quarters with a young man who's made some bad choices in his life that still weigh on him today.  Chandler's inexplicably drawn to Evan and with his forgiving nature envisions a future between them.  it will take a lot of convincing to win Evan over as self-esteem issues and Chandler's promiscuous past bruise the fragile relationship just forming between them.  While I liked the charm and self-assuredness of Chandler, as well as his ability to talk dirty, nothing stood out in him to designate him as alpha.  His brothers seemed just as strong-willed and quick to help as Chandler.Evan though is clearly subordinate as he's shy and naive in so many ways.  He's quick to blush and to acquiesce to Chandler's desires which leads to numerous super steamy encounters, but it also enhances feelings of jealousy.  All this leads to a fragile relationship which leaves Evan uncertain about his place in Chandler's world.  His criminal background deepens his uncertainty and has him running from the HEA within his grasp which frustrated me and again showed his naivety.  Evan may have a good heart but he clearly has a lot to learn as he's easily led astray.While Chandler was drool-worthy with a charming and sensual side that was appealing, Evan left me frustrated.  He was kind and cute in a way reminiscent of a puppy dog, but the inequality in his relationship with Chandler kept me from becoming fully immersed in their HEA.  There was however lots of steamy encounters in this short romance to scorch my fingers from one page to the next.  Throw in a bit of suspense very late in the story and you end up with a romance that had to fight its way to fruition.  As part of the Shifters of the Claiming Kind series this second installment CAN be read on its own but it will be more richly rewarding seeing Chandler and Evan's relationship form from the very beginning.  Fans of the paranormal and m/m genres though will find this a sexy read to give them a few hours of decadent delights.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUZB74XWT0DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P89X9CO#wasThisHelpful","R3LUZB74XWT0DG","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dynamic duo of Lauren Hawkeye and Tawny Stokes are back with another serialized read full of sensuality and suspense that will leave you wanting more.  As a companion piece to The Other Stepbrother we're reintroduced to Tristan, the strong, sexy, and supportive friend to Seth and fight coach to Allegra (both of who make a brief appearance in this book too).  He may be strong in the cage but after meeting the strong-willed Zoe he'll be brought low as his heart quickly becomes involved with her and the problems of her family.  Zoe's a tough girl who finds herself equally drawn to him and soon finds herself battling her emotions over his need to protect her and her need to protect her wayward brother.  It all makes for an exciting yet sweet and steamy read that feels more polished than their previous work.I found myself enamored the moment I met Tristan in the previous book and had hoped to see more of him.  The wait was well worth it as he's a true White Knight protective of women with a delectable kink where he likes his passion with a bit of pain.  He's an intense man loyal to those he cares about who wants to succeed on his own, hence his continuing to fight in unsanctioned bouts to keep his gym open.  He can be intimidating one moment but then show a sweet, shy, and funny side when bantering with Seth and Allegra.  He can be a true gentleman too as seen by his opening of doors and commendable behavior when arguing with his hormones.  He's all-around delightful and it's an enjoyable and entertaining start to what promises to be a steamy and sensual journey to HEA for him and Zoe.Zoe's always been the successful sibling, the one with a bright future because of her self-assured nature.  She's smart, strong-willed, and more than capable of taking care of herself through her ability to fight using words and actions.  Though her brother frustrates and disappoints her she'll still stand up for the family she loves despite the danger to herself.  She's ultimately a great match for Tristan when it comes to fighting, loyalty, and by the intensity of their physical joining and I'm looking forward to their combustible connection gaining even more steam as danger pushes them closer together.  As their lives become more intertwined while keeping her brother safe, their connection will only deepen and I can't wait for all the twists and turns to come.While the first collaboration between these authors was well done, this work feels more mature and polished.  The balance between the romance and suspense is more equal to keep readers fully entertained.  The main characters are immensely likable and on more equal footing to make their relationship richer and I feel more invested in their HEA as I find myself drawn to both Zoe and Tristan.  Though I'm a bit frustrated by the popularity of book serialization lately, I found myself completely consumed by this installment and am left greatly anticipating the next book as will other readers too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3188VXTXF9DH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XK4ETW8#wasThisHelpful","R3188VXTXF9DH8","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1Night Stand series has given me many hours of enjoyment and with Elysium it's also given me a unique and thought-provoking storyline.  With its sentimental yet modern look at lost love and the process of recovery readers are pulled into the unexpected romance between a man and woman both hiding from life.  Along with their pleasant romance there's lots of personal growth that gets them ready for love and to live once again.April has been hiding away since the murder of her husband with only her friend Janie to keep her from drowning completely.  She's always had self-esteem issues and it was only through her husband's eyes that she felt capable of anything.  With him gone she's reverted back to feelings of inferiority and is content with her menial job letting the future pass her by.  Janie's introducing her to the 1Night Stand service sets her on an unexpected journey towards change, acceptance, and ultimately fulfillment.  I liked April from the start and her grief was understandable at first, but after two years her sadness became frustrating.  Her self-esteem issues were also a bit frustrating and I was desperate to see her gain strength through whatever means necessary, even a one-night stand.  Meeting the geeky Drew brought out a vixen side to her that was refreshing and was the catalyst to her transformation which took her one step closer to HEA.Drew had been hiding from life too but for vastly different reasons.  He's a kindhearted soul who wanted to help people deal with their grief.  His talents with virtual reality gave people closure but their grief piled darkness onto his soul with his profound sadness palpable.  His work consumed him to where he was becoming lost and I ached for him.  He fell in love with April through learning her history and seeing the love she had for her husband and he slowly became jealous of a dead man.  Drew's meeting April was sweet with his awkwardness very apparent but luckily she chose that moment to take charge of her life with the results both steamy and life-altering for both of them.This was a quick read that was sentimental and brought a tear to my eye in its dealings with April and her dead husband.  The emotions their love story engender were real and powerful and I wish as much time had been spent on her and Andrew's relationship.  A large part of the story dealt with April's grief and why she fell in love with her dead husband.  Her and Drew's encounter was very steamy, immensely satisfying, and life-altering but I didn't feel the impact of their emotional connection near as much.  The ending too reinforced these feelings.  The characters on their own were both likable with emotions that were easy to relate to and I was left rooting for them every step of the way.  The flow of this story was nicely done too with the virtual reality scenes seamlessly incorporated.  Overall Ms. Landen crafted a good installment to the series that gave me a little afternoon delight and I recommend this series to readers looking for a bit of escapism.3.5 STARS!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7LBHEWTXBHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUEN5Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1S7LBHEWTXBHH","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who loves stories that are realistic in the portrayal of people's pain in real life circumstances I got immediately sucked into this story and its characters who were far from perfect.  Ms. Covington takes readers on a gutwrenching rollercoaster ride that has you admiring the main characters one moment and frustrated with them next.  While I didn't always agree with their choices I understood why they felt the way they did and managed to put my judgements aside as Ms. Covington's talented storytelling and characterizations had me supporting them warts and all.  Readers brave enough to face an emotionally draining but immensely satisfying and realistic tale will want to add this to their bookshelf.Carlisle was once the Golden Girl of the swim world with an equally perfect teammate and fiancé making her life perfect.  In the blink of an eye it was all taken away as a bomb killed her fiancé and friends, leaving her with PTSD and with shrapnel in her back that's left her in extreme pain with the possibility of paralysis or death in her future.  As a strong-willed woman who's always been in control of her life these possibilities terrify her and leave suicide her primary goal.  Until that time though she's on a path of self-destruction in an attempt to numb both the physical and emotional pain.  Sex with no-strings and various drugs have become her constant companion and I hated seeing her fall so low with her pain becoming mine through the vividly detailed inner monologues.  Into this darkness though comes the sexy and sweet Mateo, who's dealing with pain of his own, who has her throwing aside all her usual rules when it comes to relationships.  Theirs is a rocky journey full of twists and turns that leaves both of them battered, along with readers frustrated, as a big decision by Carlisle leads to even more pain through words said in anger and guilt.  It's a true test of their relationship that dimmed my happiness in the story a bit but it's a powerful moment handled with care and realism.  With such a scary future before her will Carlisle ultimately embrace the power of love and the support Mateo offers or will she keep heading towards darkness alone?  As Carlisle grows stronger throughout the story readers will want to see where she ends up.  They'll want to experience the fun and playful banter between her and her non-judgemental friend Livvy.  They'll want to blush during the numerous steamy interludes between her and Mateo that took place alongside their growing friendship.  Ultimately they'll want to witness the emotional and physical journey of a compelling woman to rebuild her life and herself after losing everything.Mateo is a fun-loving guy whose popular with the ladies but has been obsessed with Carlisle for the last year despite knowing how messed up she is.  He sees her as a challenge but also as a kindred spirit as he's feeling uncertain about his future too.  Where once he planned on a medical career with his sister he's now not sure after losing her.  With his ""white knight"" complex, and deepening feelings for her, he becomes invested in Carlisle's future which becomes much rockier once his heart becomes involved.  As his guilt over the past reaches the surface, and with Carlisle making choices to keep him from more pain, past and future collide in a true test of their feelings for each other that left me frustrated with both of them.  It was a defining moment for both of them that left their future very much in doubt.  Mateo's a truly caring man, sexy, with the ability to give as good as he gets when it comes to his witty bantering with Carlisle.  Theirs is a scorching connection from the moment they meet with emotions running hot and heavy between them that enhanced the story's overall intensity regarding issues of life and death.  As much pain as Carlisle was going through so to was Mateo which had me aching for him and all the dreams he lost as well.  Being with Carlisle finally made him deal with the past and he ultimately came out stronger despite all the pain along the way.While these characters don't always act in the expected ways you can't help but be drawn to them as they realistically dealt with the pain of their pasts and uncertain futures.  They're real with real emotions and sides to them that aren't always sunny.  Ms. Covington's talent has you rooting for them despite it all as readers join them in their rocky road to an ultimately uplifting, if still uncertain, conclusion.  Carlisle's issues were gently handled but vividly depicted and as a quadriplegic I found her concerns especially relatable though I wouldn't make the same choices.  Along with these compelling main characters came a reintroduction to characters from the previous series installment with the ever-supportive Max.  Things were also set up for the next installment with some enticing moments towards the end of the story with Mateo's friend, the fun and sexy Zane.  The Nashville Nights series continues to put reader's through the wringer with this installment that's heartbreaking, sexy, and powerful, leaving an emotional impact long after the final page is turned and I recommend it to readers who want style and substance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28B0J35T08KLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH4TBQ2#wasThisHelpful","R28B0J35T08KLW","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who considers the New Adult genre one of her favorites and has read many books in this genre, it takes a lot to set yourself apart from the crowded field.  This book does just that and I now have another author to follow as Ms. Gordon's talent for crafting a strong story and memorable romance is on display here.  From its intriguing blurb to its likable characters following an unexpected path this book won me over from the first page to the last.Everly Parker is the quintessential good girl who comes from a legacy of lawyers and whose career path is clearly written by tradition and her overbearing parents.  She's a sweet and studious girl but shows flashes of wanting something more.  After always believing in how her future was laid out she's now left in doubt, scared and a bit sad about what's to come.  With a bucket list given to her by her beloved grandmother though she'll finally get to experience living and quite possibly find what makes her truly happy and feel alive.  She's not doing it alone though as the Prince of Porn Max Levin joins her in her exhilarating and eye-opening journey to finding herself.  The two of them might start out as unexpected friends, but as they grow closer and discover the truth behind the facade, you get a sweet yet steamy relationship that put a smile on my face.  It's a rocky journey to HEA though as her parent's frigid relationship has left her jaded when it comes to love.  To truly be happy she'll have to finally stand up for herself which had me rooting for her every step of the way.Max too has always known what his future was going to be as the heir to a porn dynasty.  At first the thought thrilled him but lately it's all become blasé.  The business is starting to leave him cold and the women no longer excite him.  He's desperate to find something that excites him and meeting the strong-willed and natural Everly catches him by surprise to where thoughts of her consume him.  Helping her with her bucket list puts them together in close proximity and allows them to finally be themselves.  Not only does Everly see him as the good person he's trying to be but he starts seeing more to himself too.  He discovers that he can contribute more to the world than just sex.  Max was lovable from the start as he knew his faults and made no excuses for them.  He came from loving and committed parents but the loss of his mother has him holding back as he doesn't want to experience the heartbreak of loss again.  It left me sympathetic towards him and rooting for Everly to discover the sweet man beneath the sexy surface.This was a nicely paced book that allowed friendship to grow between Everly and Max to get us fully invested in them before entering into a sweet and sexy romance with a few bumps along the way.  These characters are depicted in a real way with banter that's entertaining and with issues that are understandable but stereotypical in romance books.  The world of porn is vividly depicted too showing it in a positive light that I'm sure isn't always accurate but makes those who participate easier to relate to.  The secondary characters are just as strong as the leads and are all in the sex trade which connects them in an intriguing way.  Stella and Jade are Everly's escorting roommates and their fun loving ways won me over.  Max's director friend Ben and porn star Lance caught my attention as well with their playfulness and with the way the story ended I look forward to seeing more of all of them.  From the first page to the last I was completely consumed by this story and its immensely likable characters and compelling, yet fun and flirty, storyline.  Readers looking to be entertained while discovering an unforgettable romance will want to grab this one and keep an eye on Ms. Gordon's future works!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103HAEZVEB8VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PEWJQ#wasThisHelpful","R103HAEZVEB8VH","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Into a dreary and dangerous post-apocalyptic world there's a war waging between humans and nocturnal creatures (werewolves and vampires) that has them constantly being hunted and fearful of being turned in.  This group of hunters, The Cazador, are a deadly and mysterious military group whose insidious plans are just beginning to emerge as they not only kill nocturnes but experiment on them as well.  As if living in fear of The Cazador wasn't bad enough, there's the centuries-long battle between werewolves and vampires fueled by arrogance and bigotry.  In the middle of all this chaos fate has brought the desperate and injured werewolf Carmela to the doorstep of her vampiric savior Derek for an unforgettable meeting that profoundly affects them and will ultimately change the course of their lives.Carmela is a shy young woman tired of her father's control and of the bleak future set before her being married to a man of her father's choosing and birthing pup after pup.  A moment of rebellion ends with her being shot and meeting a vampire who she can't help being attracted to as he represents freedom and, through his ministrations, feelings of caring and comfort so often missing in her life.  Werewolf society has become corrupted resulting in out of control male dominance that has her father physically and emotionally abusing all the women in his home in vivid and painful detail.  It's no wonder she's desperate to escape, even with the assistance of a vampire!  She's a commodity and, with the meeting of her father's chosen mate at story's end, she's running out of time to make a life of her own choosing.  Along with the bleak future facing Carmela is the dismal future for her cousin Chandra.  Chandra is a very sympathetic character as she was thrown onto the streets when her parents died leaving her to fend for herself.  She's jealous of the opportunities Carmela has as she sees endless abuse in her future from her uncle and it leads to some unpleasant moments between her and Carmela that I fear could get uglier in the future and diminish my sympathy.Derek has been a vampire a long time and you can sense his becoming tired.  He lives a solitary existence pulling away from vampiric duties he once partook in.  His only friend is fellow vampire Elliot who provided some comic relief and is trying to keep Derek active.  Meeting Carmela excited Derek but confused him as he knows their being together would result in death for them both.  He can't get her out of his mind and seeing her with another man brings out a possessive side that I look forward to seeing more of.  Derek is a good man, not overtly violent as some vampires are, and his loneliness ate at me and has me rooting for him to claim Carmela for his own.This was a fast-paced story, with almost too much happening at times to fully flesh out, teeming with sensuality.  Carmela's father is truly vile with his deeds repugnant.  He's losing control as seen through more and more marks being left on his wife and niece Chandra, and his increasing vileness of acts towards Carmela too.  Derek is the only bright spot in her life and thoughts of him sustain her through the violence being done to her.  With his possessive side kicking in I look forward to his actions in the next installment as he seems to be a man who takes what he wants...and right now he wants Carmela no matter what the fallout might be.  With these strong main characters comes equally compelling secondary characters in the mysterious and playful Elliot and the battered and bruised Chandra.  Their short time in the story left a large impact and I hope to see more of them.  From the first page to the last this tale laid compelling groundwork for the future, fully immersing me in this gritty and warring world, and has me on edge waiting for the next installment.  Fans of the paranormal will want to jump onboard for all the excitement and romance just starting with Beneath the Broken Moon: Part One.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZREMV3IKESNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPVFCHI#wasThisHelpful","RZREMV3IKESNS","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Moment of Clarity the rocky romance of Tanner and Collin comes to a tumultuous conclusion full of emotional ups and downs that kept me engaged from the first page to the last.  Touching on internal doubts as well as pressures from a not always understanding society, the boy's future was far from certain and kept me on the edge of my seat rooting for them to overcome everything.After spending a whole summer together, with their relationship put to the test, Tanner and Collin seem more committed than ever.  They're both comfortable with their being a couple and they're slowly revealing their sexuality to others.  In an instant though their happiness comes crashing down as bigotry from those in their dorm and from relatives have both of them feeling doubts.  This leads to some heartbreaking moments full of tension and sacrifice that was a bit over the top at times but ultimately made a big emotional and thought-provoking impact.Since the first book in this series Collin has been the heart of each story for me as he's struggled to come out in a very religious family.  He's a truly good young man, smart and respectful, and you can't help but want him to be happy.  After being disowned and abandoned by his family he made his own little family with Tanner, the people at Gino's restaurant, and those he met during the summer.  He's a survivor with a big heart who, after all the recent anger and upheaval directed at him and Tanner, has finally broken.  He's tired of hurting people because of his sexuality, and in his usual way of putting everyone else first, he makes some decisions that frustrated me but proved once again how caring he is.Tanner's always been the cool guy, popular and going through life with ease.  The ladies are drawn to him and the guys want to be him.  His relationship with Collin though, and the recent discovery of their pairing, has changed all that and he finally understands Collin's early fears of being discovered.  Tanner's never been judged before and found to be lacking and it's thrown him for a loop, bringing out feelings of uncertainty and fear which saddened me as he's usually so self-assured.  These newfound feelings lead to some poor choices that put even more dents in his and Collin's suddenly fragile relationship that disappointed me and kept me on edge hoping love would prevail.  Ultimately Tanner renewed my faith and proved himself a young man to admire in a sweet, sexy, and sentimental reminder of what's truly important.From beginning to end this book kept me on an emotional rollercoaster through its vividly depicted feelings of doubt and uncertainty perpetuated by society's judgements.  At times the emotions and actions revolving around their relationship became a bit melodramatic, but the immense likability of Collin and Tanner kept me fully immersed and invested in their compelling relationship.  Along with intense emotions were numerous steamy scenes, almost too many, that showed a maturing relationship becoming more serious.  The secondary characters were a colorful assortment too with some friend and some clearly foe.  Some left a lasting mark as they had a big impact on the story/series and I'd ultimately love to see more of Bryan, Wendy, and even kindhearted restauranteur Gino.  Fans of the m/m genre will be drawn to this tale that's realistic in its tone and speech as well as charmed by the sweet and endearing main characters.  With its emotional highs and lows and thought-provoking issues surrounding society and sexuality this is a story that will stay with you after the final page is turned and I look forward to more of Ms. Stivali's works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IR6ISSTWCK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYN27H0#wasThisHelpful","R36IR6ISSTWCK8","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader who loves stories full of angst where characters have to work for their HEA I was looking forward to the continuing love story of AJ and Mason begun in the previous installment.  This story didn't disappoint as both friends had to work hard to overcome their pasts to become something more.  The emotional baggage in this tale was indeed heavy, and instead of being beaten by it, it made them stronger to culminate in a very satisfying story.In the previous installment my feelings regarding AJ were conflicted as she wavered from spoiled to childish at times.  She was left bitter by all the things that happened to her, from a dangerous ex-boyfriend to a devastating loss, and it brought out a less than pleasant side.  In this book though she's grown older and wiser.  She's a woman of strength, no longer lost or willing to settle for a relationship that doesn't make her feel whole.  While her ex isn't completely out of the picture she refuses to give him anymore power over her.  To that end it's her lifelong friend Mason who meets the criteria of what she's looking for as he's always there when she needs him.  It won't be easy to transition from friends to committed lovers though as his past has left its mark on him too.  Nothing worthwhile comes without a struggle and AJ is now more than capable of going after what she wants which will take readers on a complicated yet engaging journey to HEA.Mason is a strong and sexy man who's loved AJ since they were young but always held himself back.  Now just might be the time to finally claim the woman who keeps him on his toes with her witty and flirty banter if he could only put his past in the past.  Not having the best role models, or childhood, has left an indelible mark that keeps him from committing to someone.  His views regarding love are skewed and it has him making some hurtful decisions in his burgeoning relationship with AJ that left me frustrated yet aching for him.  He's a smart and capable man in every other way but when it comes to love he's still learning.  No mater what though he's always there when AJ needs him most and it's that fact that had me rooting for their HEA, knowing it was possible.This book started out a bit muddled as the dual POVs tried to find a balance but it didn't take too long to get into a reading groove as I reacquainted myself with the complicated family dynamics.  This story definitely needs to be read after Unlike Any Other though as the groundwork is laid in that story for everything that happens here.  All the past hurts make the characters who they are now and drove them to change.  With its larger than life characters and intense gamut of emotions this is a book that's hard to put down.  The sensual connection between Mason and AJ adds to the intensity and to the entertainment with their playful moments adding to the fun.  Though I was exhausted after reading this book I'm greatly anticipating the next installment in hopes of getting to know more about MJ or JC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7KKPGNPRE56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFZ79M0#wasThisHelpful","R2K7KKPGNPRE56","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reader obsessed with MC-themed stories I was immediately captivated by the forlorn and gritty atmosphere surrounding these characters.  They're both lost, bound to others with no way to get out of the ruts they're in which formed a tenuous connection between them and made for a rocky start to their relationship that kept me turning the pages.Waitress Star is living on the edge barely making ends meet and her frustration was palpable because of it.  With the prospect of losing her job and being inappropriately touched by the local police officer yet again she just wants to go home even though the next day will be more of the same.  Seeing such a strong-willed woman brought low added to the story's overall feeling of bleakness and had me rooting for her to get the upper hand somehow.From the moment bad boy biker Noah entered the diner though Star's life will never be the same.  The sexy tattooed biker is an interesting dichotomy as he's strong yet silent, sweet talking yet a master of dirty talk, and a man who goes after what he wants but who still answers to others.  Seeing him as a way to escape the bleakness of her life she accepts the tantalizing offer he dangles in front of her which leads to a night of sensuality that's both freeing and confusing....for both of them.  When his obligations rear their ugly head will she end up paying the price?  That's the question readers are left with as we await the next installment.This was a quick read that was a bit formulaic but quickly enthralled me with its sensual haze and vividly depicted feelings of bleakness for the town and the characters themselves.  The main characters are larger than life with believable conflicts that led to many emotional twists and turns.  Their erotic encounters were both scorching yet tender and were nicely balanced within the rest of the story to keep them meaningful.  This was an addictive start to a new series that I definitely want to read more of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YK5XQ2XAR45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFDF4HO#wasThisHelpful","R36YK5XQ2XAR45","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the growing popularity of superheroes in movies and tv I was immediately drawn to the unique premise of this thought-provoking and action-packed series starter.  With its larger than life characters and intriguing dichotomy of good versus evil readers will find themselves quickly immersed in this compelling world seen through the eyes of a naive man learning hard truths way too fast.The city of Panopolis is the epicenter of a war between heroes and villains created through nefarious means enabled by pharmaceutical companies and condoned by the city's hierarchy.  The police force has become merely a figure head as the citizens place their faith wholeheartedly in the growing number of heroes against the increasingly dangerous society of villains.  Looking for adventure, and fascinated by stories of heroes and villains, the sweet and somewhat naive Edward has recently moved here and quickly finds himself caught up in the concept of good and evil from which he'll never be the same.  At first Edward saw the heroes as the good guys with no imperfections but interactions with Freight Train (aka Craig) show a hero with a bit of an ego.  Meeting the Mad Bombadier (aka Raul) as he's robbing the bank Edward works at shows a villain far more compelling and attractive than any hero inside and out.  In a relationship that starts out very slowly there's lots of conflict revolving around the acts of violence Raul commits but it's clear he has a conscience and does all he can to keep Edward safe from his deeds.  Edward's conflict is heartbreaking as their connection is deep and clear and it makes for a few rocky moments for the pair amidst some very sensual and steamy interactions.  Just when it looks as if they're heading towards HEA someone close to Edward sets off their own explosion that puts him in danger and irrevocably changes him and his relationship with Raul in a very intriguing way.This story may have started out slow but quickly picked up its pace as readers discovered more about the creation of the heroes and villains and the unethical means by which it sometimes happens.  It engenders lots of sympathy towards the villains when you're picturing them as lab rats.  In comparison, the heroes take a backseat in this tale and seem bland when in the company of such colorful villains.  Edward started off a bit quiet and naive but through his discoveries grew stronger which he'll need after the dramatic change forced upon him by the supposed good guys.  Through it all Raul stayed by his side and in an heroic way saved him which further blurs the lines of good and evil repeatedly touched on throughout the story.  Their romance was slow to build but culminated in some very steamy encounters that were nicely balanced with the action and suspense showing them as a formidable duo who I look forward to seeing avenge what befell Edward.  This was an exciting start to a series that makes you question your beliefs and with its emotionally intense ending I'm excited to see where the story will go next and will be counting down the days until the next installment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22CBZWCT2FOSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ3YHGW#wasThisHelpful","R22CBZWCT2FOSX","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers looking for a little afternoon delight will find fun and flirtiness when two people push past their prejudices to find HEA in this perfectly-paced romance.  With its two likable main characters and witty banter this novella shows why Ms. Loren has become a favorite of mine and will leave readers wanting more.  From her Loving On the Edge series to this work readers are taken on an entertaining journey that fully immerses us in their sensual world and leaves us rooting for their HEA.Natalie has always tried to be the good girl, distancing herself from her trailer park beginnings, in order to make a better future for herself than that of her mother.  She's heading in the right direction though with a clean-cut boyfriend moving up the social ladder and her burgeoning writing career, but something's missing.  On the night of her 21st birthday she discovers just what that is after her car breaks down on the side of the road and her boyfriend shows his true colors.  It's time to stop being what she isn't, her perfect facade's done nothing but gotten her cheated on.  It's time to embrace her dreams and experience true freedom with the sexy motorcycle rider with a heart of gold.  Natalie's prim and proper side was just waiting to explode and once it did it was refreshing and had me squealing with joy.  She was a cautious girl early on but her snarky and tell it like it is side soon came through to make her and Monroe's unexpected connection highly entertaining.From the moment readers see Monroe you know he's going to give you a good time.  He's carefree, likes to have fun, and isn't looking for a long-term relationship.  Being around Natalie though brings out a different side.  He may not want to be her white knight but he ends up giving her the best birthday ever by showing her her true worth.  He's a tattooed God who may appear a bit rough around the edges but he's an honorable man with a sweet soul and I quickly fell for him.  His interactions with Natalie were flirty, playful, and teeming with sexual tension and it led to a crackling connection.  Just when their HEA appears in reach his plans to see the east coast put a damper on things as does her fears over taking a leap of faith.  Will his promise of happiness and freedom be enough to tempt her to join him for the ride of her life or will she go back to being cool, calm, and collected?This was a quick read with the perfect balance of laughter and romance.  The connection between Natalie and Monroe might've been quick but it felt more real than what she had with Caleb.  Though she gave Caleb a piece of her mind over his cheating, I still felt that things between them were left undone.  I also would've liked to see more of Natalie's past as it greatly affected her relationships now.  Ultimately though this was another well-crafted story from Ms. Loren with two immensely likable characters and their sexy and sassy road to romance and I recommend it to readers looking for a little afternoon delight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XRTKYXOR9CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGZB22G#wasThisHelpful","R5XRTKYXOR9CO","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With around 50 pages Ms. Popescu has crafted a thoughtprovoking and atmospheric tale where fantasy and reality are blurred to lead readers on a merry chase.  With bits of sci-fi and futuristic elements too readers are shown a world full of dangers that a cruel woman uses to her advantage in her perverted name of love to wrap up with an ending that leaves readers guessing.The cold and manipulative Moira Brenwood came from the slums but used all her twisted talents to rise to the top and become a very rich woman that uses those riches to keep her son locked in a gilded cage.  Under the guise of keeping him safe he's a virtual prisoner, never allowed to leave or interact with anyone other than his mother and his doctor.  Having lost the only two people she ever cared for has her desperate to keep Wynn safe but it feels as if there's more to her actions than just that and I felt that there were bigger secrets hidden beneath her pristine facade.Wynn has been kept in isolation since a childhood illnes.  His life is completely regimented, full of bland colors and bland food, with one day blending into the next.  The only things that keep him going are the occasional promises to go out for a walk, which never come to fruition.  All of this makes Wynn a truly sympathetic character, but one who's also a bit naive around the edges.  Considering his cloistered state though this is no surprise.  As he gets closer to the edge, showing his frustrations more acutely, a mysterious man shows up to give him moments of happiness, newfound sensuality, and acceptance.

"RJ Scott's contribution to the Tales of The Curious Cookbook series is a heartwarming one that will make readers misty-eyed but with a smile on their face.  When a young Englishman who's always felt a bit lost waiting for something he can't define, meets a carefree artsy American, their unexpected connection brings them together in a sensual journey to HFN that's richly rewarding.  Throw in a bit of mystery courtesy of the matchmaking elder Maggie, who recently passed, and you have an entertaining story with a rich atmosphere that fully immerses you into their journey.Robbie was left adrift after graduating college but was luckily taken under the wing of the sweet and wise Maggie who gave him a job and a home that fed into his creativity.  The only thing missing was love which once again arrived courtesy of Maggie's long-lost relative Jason.  When fate puts them in close proximity the sparks fly in a slowly sensual burgeoning relationship that crackles in intensity yet is sweet in the support they give one another.  Robbie is a quiet soul, self-deprecating when it comes to his art but in Jason he finds the other half to his artistic heart.  Robbie's the legacy left behind by Maggie and he works very hard to keep her memories alive in subtle ways like perfecting her famous cake recipe after discovering the most important ingredient...love.  Jason is more of a mystery as we only find out things through Robbie's view.  What I saw though I liked immensely.  He too wanted to do right by his family's memory and uncovering the past was a big part of that with the breadcrumb trail intriguing.Though Maggie's dead for almost the entire book her character still loomed large.  Through her matchmaking and mysterious background she brought two young men together to live out the love story she never had and it made for a sweetly satisfying endeavor.  The small town surrounding these characters also plays a part in showcasing the closeness of everyone over one woman's memory and is vividly depicted as to further immerse me in the story.  Along with its sweetness was a nice amount of steamy sexual interludes between Robbie and Jason that intensified as they grew closer.  All in all it was a short read long on sentiment and sensuality and was a decadently delightful way to spend the afternoon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358FLEE1WQA0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VB0P1DO#wasThisHelpful","R358FLEE1WQA0Q","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Hammell's Canadian Muscle series gets off to a rousing start with this exhilarating blend of suspense and eroticism.  Add in a drool-worthy hero who is a born savior and an independant woman with a damaged past whose combustible connection scorches the pages and you have an exciting and fast-paced read.As a reader who loves scarred heroes I was instantly drawn to Gavin with his limp and damaged hearing due to his wartime duty.  In promise to a friend he starts working as a bouncer/bodyguard in a burlesque club that's been targeted by underworld criminals.  Though Gavin doesn't like to stay in any one place for long he's determined to bring this vile villain to justice as he hates bullies and those who hurt those who are weaker.  Distracting him during this new mission is the sexy and conflicted Shree who he feels an instant attraction to.  Though the attraction is superficial at first he slowly grows closer to her as her past is revealed.  When the enemy hits close to home Gavin will have to call on all his military training to save the one woman to finally give him a reason to stay in one place.  I adored Gavin as he never let his disabilities define him, he remained the badass hero with the brawn to get the job done.  He has a softer side too that was seen through his strong protective instincts that were a bit smothering at times but always came from the heart and it further endeared him to me.Shree's an intriguing heroine that was a good match for Gavin as her strong side was an aphrodisiac to him with her damaged past calling to his protective nature.  On every level he wanted her and their insta-love relationship crackled with sexual tension.  Shree knows that Gavin doesn't believe in commitment which is fine by her as she'll be leaving the club as soon as she graduates.  She'll enjoy what he's offering for now but not count on the future.  Her past further tarnishes their future as her fears over dominant and strong-willed men leave her a bit leery of Gavin.  This uncertainty put her in danger, held captive by a madman, and had me on the edge of my seat waiting for Gavin to rescue her.  For the most part I liked Shree and admired her surviving her tragic past to make something of her future by juggling work and school.  I was frustrated though by the doubts she had of Gavin as he never gave her a reason to fear him or doubt his ability to protect her.From start to finish this was an engaging story that nicely balanced the suspense with the burgeoning and erotic relationship between Gavin and Shree.  Their sexual interludes were scorching and left me parched with their intensity but we're nicely spaced throughout the story to keep them meaningful.  Gavin is a wonderful hero with a good heart who always put others first.  He's a loyal man who inspires loyalty in others as seen by the secondary characters who aid him in bringing down the bad guy.  Shree's a strong-willed heroine whose pigheadedness put her in danger but who still left me rooting for her as her strength continued to shine through even in the face of danger.  I enjoyed Charlie and her sweet and endearing connection to Gavin as his honorary sister.  She's another strong-willed heroine who I hope to see more of as she never gave in to fear or intimidation.  Readers who love erotic tales with combustible interactions and a pulsepounding pace will be drawn to this series starter and clamoring in anticipation for the next installment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Q51R1UF1OSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGZFDQ4#wasThisHelpful","R16Q51R1UF1OSV","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers longing for summer will find themselves drawn to this nostalgic read that is full of fun and flirtiness, along with numerous references to the '90s.  With its outspoken heroine who loves to have fun and flits from man to man to the sexy yet sweet hero on the cusp of fame this is a read full of witty banter and sizzling interactions.  It all makes for a good read from a new-to-me author.Livia's a young girl who lives her life in a carefree way full of fun and friends.  She's not into commitment but after seeing a hot new singer she might be changing her tune.  Throughout the early stages of the story I was torn by my feelings for Livia.  While I admired her strength and ability to tell it like it is, I also found her a bit abrasive and demanding.  Her fears of commitment were due to past trust issues and I saw this permeating many aspects of her life and made for a rocky road to romance with Jack.  I enjoyed her interactions with her friends that were believable and relatable and happy that her friend time was nicely balanced with her couple time.Jack was a delicious hero who came from an ordinary background but was now heading for stardom.  I loved that his impending fame hasn't changed him, in fact it has made him an even better person.  From the start he's clearly more mature than Livia.  He's tired of partying and meaningless relationships.  He sees something in Livia that calls to him but it will be a difficult journey to get her to commit to what they could be together.  Her attraction to him has her agreeing to their ten-date policy before going further which leads to palpable sexual tension but will deepen their relationship ultimately.  Jack was the king of dirty talk which made their agreement even more fun to watch as the temptations increased.  He's a drool-worthy guy who lit up every scene he was in!The relationship was a sensual journey full of flirtiness but with a big hiccup towards the end that luckily was resolved quickly.  This hiccup once again left me frustrated by Livia and her demanding nature but happy with the promise of where the conclusion takes us.  With lead characters that are larger than life, particularly the heroine, I was happy that the secondary characters were just as engaging.  Livia's friends especially intrigued me and hopefully the author will explore their lives further.  This book was a bit draggy early on but the '90s references put a smile on my face and kept me turning the pages with remembrances of my own teen years.  This time period was vividly depicted to further enhance the nostalgia and immerse readers even more and I applaud the author for these seamless inclusions.  This was my first time reading Ms. Torrest but her breezy style will have me coming back for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5P674WXJ52E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKEF9LS#wasThisHelpful","R5P674WXJ52E5","A2BRAUQW0M47DQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BRAUQW0M47DQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't purchase my FrSky Taranis Plus on Amazon but thought I would jot down my experience so far. 15+ years ago I used Futaba when I first got in to the hobby. Got out of it for a while. When I came back in to the hobby a few years later I used Spektrum and have been using Spektrum ever sense. I have been wanting to get the Spektrum DX9 for its features but didn't want to pay the price for it. For a long time I have been watching on YouTube, the videos with a lot of people using the Tatanis. I finally pulled the trigger and got one. Man! I love it and having the ability to still use all my oild equipment through a OrangeRX Moduel is asesome! I can still use the BNF from Horizon Hobby and slowly upgrade my other equipment with the D4R2. Love the D4R2. RSSI and telemetry. Watch out Spektrum, Futaba. and others. FrSky has the best price and features. I'm not going back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSOUZJLNABNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL1CJGG#wasThisHelpful","R1NSOUZJLNABNV","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 10-30-15Just added a picture of it working on the 4th generation Apple TV.*****This controller works flawlessly with the new Apple TV 4 generation. It paired with the apple TV in just a few seconds in the Bluetooth setup tab for the Apple TV. I actually think I like navigating the Apple TV with the Controller better in most cases than the new Apple TV touch remote. I am going to try the SteelSeries Nimbus controller too, to try out, but I think I may be getting more of the Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i controllers because of the button layout is just like the Xbox One and because it feels solid in my hands. The Nimbus has both thumb sticks at the bottom of the controller.***** Works fantastic with my iPhone 6s Plus---Original Review---Everything works fantastic with one exception. You have to download the app on your iPhone or iPad before you par it. It did take several attempts to par it before it took but has worked fantastic sense. All of the buttons and sticks work smooth. Fits my iPhone 6+ with a OtterBox Commuter case just perfectly. Just what I was looking for.

"I use to use regular pencils all the time for daily duties both at work and at home. I can't tell you how many pencils I have gone through. I remembered back to the days when I took drafting in school and I remembered that we used mechanical pencils and they were awesome! I wanted to give it a try again. I looked through Amazon a while back and found that the Uni-ball Kuku-Toga Mechanical Pencil starter set had the most reviews so I was thinking that this must be a real good mechanical pencil. Man. Everyone was correct about this one. I love it and use it all the time. I like it so much that I not want to get one for my office and one for my truck while keeping my first one at home.First off it feeds the pencil leds smoothly and the leds write clean and sharp. Next the mechanical pencil feels good in my hand when writing especially for a long time. It was very easy to load the leds in to the pencil. The eraser is nice but I never use it and even if I did I don't think it would last for very long. I also have looked for replacement erasers and I could not find any so I purchased a few pink school style erasers (Papermate) to keep around. That setup works very good for me. All in all I love the Uni-ball Kuku-Toga Mechanical Pencil is a hit with me and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a food deal and a very good product. It is my favorite for everyday use hands down :-)Hope this helps someone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTMZX9UP6TLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026ICM1E#wasThisHelpful","R1PTMZX9UP6TLJ","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like these D Battery storage boxes.I am going to use a few for batteries and I want to use one to hold all 8 of my battery adapters.They all fit very nice without much moving around inside. I like the separator in the middle but wish they had two more. One for each row of two.Why, you ask? I purchased some D batteries from a local corner store and put them in the storage box. One of the batteries in the top of the box had a leak and acid dripped on the other three batteries and made them useless. If there was two more dividers in there it would have saved the other two batteries. This is nothing big but would be nice.Another nice thing about these battery storage boxes is that they are easy to stack if you have more than one of them.Other than that I think they are a good and safe purchase for D battery storage boxes.

"This is a nice screen protecter for my iPhone 4S.It went on very easy but there was one small hiccup for me.Be real careful with dust when you put it on. Also wash your hand and clean the iPhone before you start.I thought I had everything done properly when I noticed two small pieces of dust got in when I put the screen protector on.SGP gives you these one time use little stickers to try to grab the dust off the protector after you peel back the protector partially. It worked but as I reinstalled the part I lifted up I got another piece of dust in there. I did that process again. This time it worked and looks real nice. I am very happy with the SGP Ultra Crystal screen protector and yes I would get another one if needed.

When you drop a $80.00 dollar laser it breaks just as fast as a $5.00 dollar laser. This laser is a fraction of what I paid before for a different brand name green laser and I get almost as good of a quality laser compared to the more expensive one. I now can afford a few of them. One for each of my scopes, one for use when showing family and friends where we are looking and a few for backup just in case I break another one. This time it won't hurt as much because I didn't pay as much. I do have to say that It does seem to be very will made. The two pieces screw together smoothly. Nice clean threads on it. It feels solid. Not cheep like others I have looked at. Another big plus about this laser is that it had free shipping but it took a bit longer to get it because it came from China. Only about two weeks. Not bad at all for the price. Another thing that I like about the feel of this laser is that the outside of the unit is covered in a rather thick rubber like material. It feels good but also helps keep it from slipping out of your hand.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a green laser especially if you are in to astronomy.**** PLEASE DON'T POINT THIS AT ANY PLANES! The FCC is cracking down on people and kids getting these lasers and and doing just that. If we don't watch out, soon we may not have access to them because the FCC could ban them for that very reason.Hope this review helps with someone with there choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBUKSJZHH7Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DXBLQO#wasThisHelpful","R1IBUKSJZHH7Z4","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my Klean Kanteen but I hated the standard cap with a hole in the top so I wanted to look for something better and I thought I saw a different cap listed. I went back to Amazon.com to check. When I got there I found the Klean Kanteen Cap/Polypro. There was some good review and a few negative ones but when you want something, you want something no matter what a few other people may say.Now on to the good:In my opinion this is a much better cap for me and I like it. It doesn't have a problem keeping the water in the Kanteen and I feel safe with it in my book bag that gets tossed around a lot. No Leakage.Now for the bad:The cap is two piece and not solid. One of the first times I washed it I let it stand in the water for a while while I was eating dinner. When I went to finish washing it I noticed that water got in to the cap and I could not get it out. Actually it took a while of shaking it around but I got it. Also sense it is not solid, if I twist the cap on a bit tight, when you go to twist it off I noticed that the two pieces of the cap slip just a bit before the cap actually moves so I can twist it off the Kanteen. I hope it doesn't get any worse.That seems to me to be the only two drawbacks to it. I still like it though.One tip. You don't have to crank down on the cap when you twist it on. The rubber gasket is very good and it is soft. It seems to seal very nicely and it seems like it is going to last.All in all it is very nice but don't let it sit in the water for to long or the water is going to get in to the cap and become a pain to get out.Hope this review helps someone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKP1FQHIZ3PD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012AXOY6#wasThisHelpful","RKP1FQHIZ3PD1","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying that this is not a industrial clipboard/storage box but this seems to hold up good.I am a ham radio operator and I run nets from time to time, work public service events among other stuff and I always need to keep some forms and paperwork with me for the nets in my truck. This fills the bill nicely for a real good price.I am able to keep two (100 sheet) half pads of paper and some paperwork in the storage part of the box behind the clipboard. There is also a very nice smaller storage box at the bottom that I use for a pen, mechanical pencil with extra leds and a eraser. everything fits nicely and is safe from being knocked around behind the front seat of my truck. There has been a few times that I had to jam on my breaks and the clipboard slit forward and hit the metal Post of my seat quite hard. The storage area never came open and I can't see any marke on the clipboard from the impacts. It is holding up nice.I would have liked to see a more heavy hinge on it but for the price I can deal with it. All in all I would recommend this to anyone!I live in the Northeast and it is starting to get cold out. This is going to be a nice test to see how it holds up in the cold, especially on the hinge. I'll update once I see how it holds up in the cold weather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXT8NFQZGDNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MCZA2C#wasThisHelpful","R2UXT8NFQZGDNY","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been doing a lot of research on this subject and the SkipDR fit the bill the best for me. I like to purchase TV series on DVD and they can get very expensive at times. Because of the coast I like to try to get them used when ever I can to save a little cash. With that being said, some of them have scratches and work but sometimes have read errors. This is where SkipDR came in to play. I had 2 sets of DVD TV series (Smallville and NCIS) end each had 1 DVD in the set that didn't play correctly. To replace them would be expensive ($50.00 Plus for the two sets) and I could not find any places to resurface them sense Game Crazy went under. For $16.48 from Amazon I got SkipDR and gave it a try. One of the DVDs had some deep scratches in it so I had to go a few extra rotations but after a little bit of elbow grease they worked like new with NO ERRORS :-)The SkipDR has already paid off for its self! I like it so much that I think I am going to spring for the battery operated one with some extra repair wheels for my Xbox360, Blueray and WII discs. Always nice to have around just in case.The big thing that helped me with this product is reading the reviews and watching Youtube videos on the SkipDR. It is really very easy to use and does a very good job for what I had to do with it so far. Get it and give it a try. It may save you money like it did for me :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXPBED3GYBDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015ACUKC#wasThisHelpful","RMXPBED3GYBDN","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that this is exactly what I was looking for. I watched that awesome video review on Amazon and read all the reviews. From  what I could see is that if it worked it would fill the bill quite nicely. I did see some bad stuff on charging the AA batteries internally so I am not going to do it. I have a very nice La Crosse battery charger that I have been using for years so charging the AA batteries inside the Tekkeon Charger is not that big of a deal for me. Now on to the charger.Today I found the Tekkeon Charger in my mail box. I opened it without reading the direction (I do not suggest this) and only going on all the reviews info I read and watched on the Amazon web page I popped in some NiMH 2200 mAh low self discharge batteries I have. I got out the OEM cords for my 3G iPod Touch and my Samsung Galaxy Prevail smart phone. I turned on the Tekkeon Charger and three LED lit up. Then I plugged in my Samsung smart phone and the LED's dropped from 3 to 2. OK, I can deal with that. My phone showed 75% charge. After 45 minutes I went back to the phone and checked the charge. It was reading 98%. While I was waiting for it to get done I watched TV. While watching TV I heard a small ""Click"" from the charger and found that all the LED's were back on and my phone showed ""Charged"" in the display. AWESOME :-)I needed to test the charger some more so I plugged it on to my iPod Touch 3G showing a 2/3ds charge with the stock OEM USB charging cable. Once again the Tekkeon Charger showed all 3 LED's and then I plugged in my iPod Touch and the LED's went back down to 2. Fine by me. I am thinking it is showing that the iPod Touch is drawing from the charger and that is why it goes down to 2 LED's. Some place in the reviews there were people who stated not to charge a iPod or iPhone with more than a half charge left in them. I did try to charge my iPod Touch anyway (I don't suggest this). While watching it from my Lay-Z-Boy with the Green Bay game on I noticed all three LED's were back on. It was only between 30 minutes and 45 minutes when I checked it. I pushed the front button on the iPod Touch and it showed a large green battery pic indicating that the iPod Touch 3G was charged. Real nice :-) The Tekkeon Charger never got even slightly warm for both tests.I don't know about you but this mad me VERY HAPPY and the Tekkeon Charger still had some charge left to do the job all over again.Tomorrow I am going to recharge my AA batteries and drain my iPod touch all the way down and see what happens when I charge the iPod back up with the Tekkeon Charger. I'll post my results. I am also going to do the same test with my Samsung smart phone. Need to time everything this time.There was a very nice black bag that came with the charger and a small retractable USB cord real along with some attachments. The only ones I am going to keep is the USB retractable cord real and the mini USB adapter just in case I want to try to recharge my  AA batterie internally if I want to experiment. The other adapters are kind of useless for me. I'll am going to keep the charger in the bag when not in use. The bag should keep it from getting scratched.All in all, what isn't there to like about this awesome little Charger! Fits my need for what I want to use it for and I plan to only use the OEM USB charging cords with whatever I charge. What device doesn't come with a USB cable now a days?Give it a try. You may like it like I do.UPDATE 09-11-11  So far so GOOD :-)After 2 partial charges to my iPod Touch 3g and my Samsung Galaxy Prevail smart phone both receiving about 1/3ed of a charge to top them off and I had some battery left. I wanted to see how much so I played movies on my iPod Touch till it was down to about a 10% charge and I plugged in the Tekkeon Charge. I came back about a hour and a half later and I had a 74% charge and the Tekkeon Charger LEDs were off so that ment the batteries were dead. Not bad. I then cycled the batteries in my La Crosse charger and then let the batteries rest for a while. I drained my iPod Touch and smart phone once again. My iPod touch was at a 15% charge when I started at 10PM. At 11PM I checked the iPod Touch to find out that it was at 100% charge with 2 LEDs still lit. I wanted to see what else I could do so I hooked it to my smart phone at 13% of a charge and came back at 12:30AM I found the Tekkeon Charger was dead with no LEDs lit and my phone was reading a 43% charge.So I am guessing that for the most part I can get about one and a half charges out of 4 2200 mAh LDS batteries. I would also think if you were using Alcaline batteries you would get even more out of them than from the rechargeables IMHO.Now to charging with the USB cable provided. I decided to give it a try under close supervision. I plugged it in to my computer USB port. After 5 minutes it was warm but not hot. After about a half of an hour it was a bit warmer but still not all that bad. When you charge the light is red. If it starts to blink it means ""batteries are not useable"". After about a half of an hour the red light started flashing. I tried three different brands of batteries with the same results so I disconnected the USB cable. To my surprise when I turned on the Tekkeon Charger power switch all three LEDs were lit and I was able to get a 45% to 50% charge on my iPod Touch on each of the three times. I think the charger portion of my unit may be bad but I was very surprised with the results. It seems that the charger is really charging at a very high rate to get that much in the batteries in just a half of an hour. I wont be using the USB cable to charge the batteries again. The manual states that it'll charge 2 batteries in 3 hours and 4 batteries in 6 hours. Who knows what it is doing to the batteries let alone the Tekkeon Charger.I'll just charge my AA batteries in my La Crosse charger and let the Tekkeon Charger charge anything else that can be charged via USB port.The Tekkeon Charger is awesome at what it does and for the price. I am going to keep one in my book bag and keep the other one home for power outages and camping trips. I always have a hand full of rechargeable AA batteries around the house for my electronics so I'll be set when I need them. I hope this review helps someone out with there decision on getting this charger. It is exactly what I was looking for and in my opinion it is worth its weight in gold.One more end note. I also tried to charge my phone from just two AA rechargeable batteries. It does work but it is very slow. Stick with using 4 batteries at a time. Much more faster.UPDATE 11-05-12 Still going.After all this time this is still working very good for me. ***I have to say to all that I never recharge the rechargeable batteries in the Tekkeon TekCharge its self. I charge them in my home charger while watching TV at night :-) In the morning I put the batteries in the TekCharger and put it in my book bag for the next time I need it. We have a lot of power outages where I live and this has proven to be so handy! I think I have to get another one soon for a backup just in case because I like it and use it so much. Have fun with it and I hope this update helps with someones decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URB4XFS4N68D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014KLX9C#wasThisHelpful","R2URB4XFS4N68D","A30C3EFTH23DB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C3EFTH23DB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that my last camera was a 3.5 MP and it was good for what I used it for but I let it bounce off the floor one to many times and it has died. That is when I started to look around for other easy to use good quality cameras. I looked at a lot of my friends cameras and started to read all the reviews.One of my friends had the Nikon L20 and he loved it. I tried it out too and loved it but I then found out that the L22 was replacing the L20. I asked around and found a friend that had the Nikon L22 and he let me use it for a weekend. What a very nice camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and then some. All the pictures and videos looked awesome to me and I did not have one problem with it at all. All the pics were sharp and focused. What more could you want? East to get batteries! Yup this camera uses AA batteries and I had a boat load of them. Everything in my house seems to use AA batteries so a long time ago I switched everything in my house to rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They last forever in this camera. Say if you were at a wedding or something and your batteries run out. Just go to your local corner store and get a few easy to find AA batteries or just bring a few extra from home. Life is easy for me. I hate the proprietary batteries that come with most cameras. The other good thing about this camera is it uses standard SD and SDHC memory cards. I got a 8GB SDHC card for $19.00 bucks. It gave me something like 2,200 available pics to take at 12MP. Needless to say I purchased this camera in sliver from Amazon.com and I take it everywhere with me. Remember it is a $100.00 dollar camera and not a $500.00 dollar camera. It doesn't have all the high end features like touch screen but it has everything I want and it takes really nice pics. I don't think you'll go wrong with the Nikon L22. Get it.

"Just received these yesterday and I am a happy wiping, cleaning fool.These are just what I've been looking for.It sounds silly to be so thrilled over rags, but I've been having trouble finding small, dark colored, microfiber rags that actually wipe things clean and streak free and absorb liquids without just smearing water around.To make things even pickier on my part, I was looking for a basic color - - - why oh why are most of these rags bright, neon, striped or fluorescent colored? It's a rag and I don't want it to scream for attention in my kitchen.These are the perfect size (roughly the size of a washcloth) for hanging discretely in my sink. They wipe down my stainless sink and chrome fixtures water-spot-free. They wring out nearly dry, so cleaning counters and are a one step process.The black rags I received are odor free.  Others have commented on a strong smell, so perhaps it's the specific dye and odor only exists w/ certain colors?At first, I didn't notice any color bleed because I was rinsing the rags in cold/lukewarm water.  The first time I rinsed it using hot water however, the color ran a just little.  It didn't affect the color of the rag at all, and it was such a slight bleed, that if I hadn't been wringing it out over a white bowl that just happened to be in the sink at the time, I wouldn't have even noticed.  After that first hot water rinsing, it no longer bleeds at all.About as happy as one can be about cleaning rags!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WKM7NKN3QH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM1BWJQ#wasThisHelpful","R38WKM7NKN3QH7","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am 5'4"", 130 lbs and this L-XL fits me perfectly!I initially ordered the Small in the mid-calf style and had to return it because of the fit.  In that particular case, it wasn't that it was too small, but that the proportions were strange - - - the pockets were high up at my stomach, and the belt tied at my rib cage.I decided to try this full length style in the larger size.The pockets on this Large sit right at my hips (where pockets should be), and the belt ties comfortably at my waist.Even the length, on my 5'4"" frame, is perfect.  It hits right at my ankles.The chenille is a nice weight, and after an initial tumble in the dryer, it's not shedding anymore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCE6ANO8ZT05P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRTXVHU#wasThisHelpful","RCE6ANO8ZT05P","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am 5'4"", 130 lbs - - - very average in proportions.After reading other reviews and getting the general sense that this generally runs on the generous side of true to size, I ordered a S-M.Unfortunately, I will be sending this back.The overall size of this is fine, in that the shoulder span, sleeve length and surplus wrap is very comfortable.It's not that it runs too big or too small, but that it is proportioned strangely.The belt (in the attached loops), sits high on my rib cage.  It would seem simple to just take the belt out of the loops and cinch it lower, but that isn't possible because the patch pockets are also placed too high.  If I cinch the belt at my comfortable normal waistline, I would be tying it right over both pockets - - - bulky and making the pockets unusable.  Even if I left the belt in the too-high-beltloops, the pockets are still placed too high for my liking.I like to stuff my hands into pockets that sit right about at my upper thighs.  These pockets are placed right at stomach/hip bone height -- not comfortable to me at all - - puts too much of a bend in my elbows making me feel like doing a chicken dance.I am pleased with the feel of the fabric, and knowing how difficult it is to find a basic chenille wrap robe, I am now trying to decide if I should order this same mid-calf robe in a large, or order the full length style instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGD0NDV8VTBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRTY1F6#wasThisHelpful","R2NGD0NDV8VTBI","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing my husband asked when he saw this sink, was ""geez . . . how much did you pay for this?"".We did a light face-lift renovation of our kitchen and replaced our granite countertop with quartz.  This was the perfect chance for me to replace our old two bowl sink with this deep single bowl.Sink is solid, heavy, comes packaged and protected like nothing I've (or my contractor) ever seen before.  Thick and heavy box, solid styro, and encased in a heavy black drawstring bag.  TVs, computers, newborn infants . . . I've never seen anything wrapped and protected better than this.The included sink grid is heavy duty and solid as well.  The strainer is beautiful with a lift out basket, but unfortunately was of no use to me because we hooked up a disposal.  And, because they couldn't do enough to impress, they also included a thick and heavy hand towel as a thank you.The included template is for zero counter reveal, so if you want either a slight countertop overhang, or a reveal, you'll have to adjust for that.This sink went in to replace a 30"" double bowl sink.  Same size, in the same size base cabinet but the difference is unbelievable.  This sink is absolutely huge, deep and amazing.  We have a Grohe Lady Luxe faucet and the distance from sink grid to faucet is 21"" - - tons of clearance for even the largest of platters and pots.  Dishes left in the sink are out of view, filling and washing pots and vases no longer require careful maneuvering, and I never knew how much I'd appreciate being able to lay a cutting board or saute pan flat in the sink to wash.The 16 gauge is super heavy, and the underside sound dampening is extremely generous.  Using the included sink grid protects from scratches, but also prevents the noise that can occur with stainless sinks.The dimensions allow for 4"" countertop at the front, and a very comfortable 5"" deck for faucet and other fixtures.  I had our countertop fabricator drill 5 holes on the deck (hot water dispenser, disposal air switch, faucet, soap dispenser, dishwasher airgap - - installed in that order L-R).  The holes are 5.25"" on center, and although I was a tad worried this would look too cluttered, it looks and functions great.The rounded, tight radius corners make clean up very easy, and just a wipe with a microfiber rag at the end of every day is all it needs to keep it water-spot free.  For cleaning, I've been happy and successful using Bar Keepers Friend.Absolutely and completely happy with this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13G3KKB0SLE3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032BYM4Y#wasThisHelpful","R13G3KKB0SLE3C","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Strong, smart, but have to be precise if using on both ends of the bar.  Only item to be sure to have is a 1 1/4"" hole saw bit.  These are inexpensive, fit on any drill and usually come in a pack of assorted sizes.Used these the first time when installing the Moen toilet tissue/grab bar because these mounts came with that item - - easy peasy piece of cake.Later, I purchased the coordinating Moen towel/grab bar to replace an existing normal towel bar. I wanted this new bar to be installed in the exact same spot (in drywall) of the old towel bar so I wouldn't have a bunch of holes to patch. I purchased these mounts as an add on to give support as I knew I wouldn't be screwing into a stud.Important to keep in mind, is if you want (as I did) to install in the same location as a previous bar, this means you will have the existing (smaller) holes in the drywall where the old bar bracket came off. This creates a problem when using your drill and the 1 1/4"" hole saw.  These hole saws are meant to hold themselves centered using a center drill bit, and make the larger hole relative to this center point.Because you already have an existing center point hole, there is nothing for the hole saw bit to hold onto and keep centered. I ended up taking the hole saw bit off the drill, and used a rubber mallet to pound it into the drywall deep enough so the teeth left an impression in the drywall and the hole saw bit would have something to grab onto.I needed the bar to be precisely in the same location because it was centered under a window.  If this was not the situation and I could mount it give or take an inch or two, I would have placed the center bit just a 1/2"" left or right of my existing holes. The 1 1/4"" hole would encompass the old screw holes and the hole saw bit would still have ""new"" drywall"" to drill through.A little more work and frustration this second time around, but the clean look and strength of these mounts make it worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B63JWOD1ABM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q02FX0#wasThisHelpful","R2B63JWOD1ABM9","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really nice look and feel to this pump dispenser.  It was an easy install and the only thing that caused me a teeny bit of concern, is that the reservoir bottle is larger than others.  This is a great thing, in that it won't need to be refilled as often, but it was a tight fit in the space between the sink itself and among the dishwasher and faucet lines.The pump has a nice resistance feel to it.  I've only had it in place for a week now, but so far since priming it the first time, it hasn't needed to be primed again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XG3CX3Q4G4OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8VTNW0#wasThisHelpful","R1XG3CX3Q4G4OU","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When nutrition is a problem, you want to be sure that every bite (or swallow) counts. In the same volume as other drink supplements, this packs in double the calories.This high calorie formula only comes in vanilla.  The taste is the same as the regular formula, and the consistency is a tad thicker.Although he liked it, after a while, my son started to tire of vanilla at every meal.I bought some strong, French roast instant coffee and discovered this makes for a pretty dang delicious frappuccino.  Dissolve a tsp-tbsp of instant coffee in as little hot water as possible.  You want to add concentrated flavor, not volume.  Add this coffee slurry to the carton of Boost and you've just created a nutritional coffee drink.A couple other options for variety:1 - Mix with concentrated orange juice to create a Creamsicle/Orange Julius drink.  Instead of just using juice, use frozen canned concentrate.  If you use non-concentrated juice, you have to use almost a 1:1 ratio in order for the juice flavor to come through.  Having to double the volume defeats the whole purpose of concentrated calories.  A tbsp of frozen concentrate is about right for one box.Lime concentrate was yummy too.  Other juice flavors (apple and cranberry) mixed w/ this vanilla (in my sons opinion), were too sweet.  Be creative.  I'm sure any juice concentrate would work.2 - A squeeze of chocolate syrup turns this into a chocolate drink.  I used dark chocolate syrup so it would be less sweet.My son had gone from 175 to 110 lbs post surgery.  Tube feeding formulas gave him horrible digestive problems, but he had no appetite and did not want to eat.  This was the miracle drink that got him back on his feet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2DRFA457G1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJB9JHI#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2DRFA457G1I","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice grinding mechanism, adjustable coarseness, perfect size and nice, comfortable heft and weight.My one criticism  however, is also about something I like - - -There is a removable bottom plate that holds about a tsp and allows the grounds to be contained.  This is a nice feature, as you can pre-grind a nice spoonful, pull off the bottom, then either sprinkle directly from the bottom cover, or empty and measure out a specific amount.  It's also nice that when not in use, residual grounds don't filter out onto the stove or counter top.My only complaint about this removable bottom, is that it's a bit tedious to remove.  I typically just use my nail to pry it off (it's not super tight), but my husband with fat fingers and short nails will have to go grab a spoon or knife.  If my hands are dry, I can sometimes manage to grip the thin bottom and wiggle it loose, but how often are your hands dry when cooking?Overall though, still a nice 5 stars for a compact, sturdy and very attractive mill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGP36WA12OYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q23VNSW#wasThisHelpful","R3UGP36WA12OYI","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strong magnet hold, keeps sponge off the floor of the sink and hidden from view.The magnets are super strong and I see no reason to have to use the adhesive.  Without the adhesive, the holder is infinitely movable and once it's in place, you can even make minor adjustments just by slowly sliding the holder around on the inside of the sink - - - the back magnet will just follow it around.The u-shaped holder was a bit large and loose, so all I did was gently squeeze it so my sponge fits a bit more tightly and doesn't tend to slip out as easily.This, along with the cloth holder are two of my favorite things in my new kitchen.  My husband says ""what, we just spent $$$ on a new kitchen and these two $50 items are your favorite !?!?"".

"If using this behind a tv or other object which will permanently hide this outlet box, then this is a great idea and great item.  The ""wings"" on the box allow for easy retrofit in existing construction.Please realize though, if using these anywhere that they'll be visible, these boxes are very plastic-y and cheap looking.  The face plate is not smooth and finished like usual outlet covers.  There are 8 screws and holes on the front - - necessary because half of them are for the installation wings, and the other 4 are for attaching the face plate to the box - - but all these screws and holes on the front are very, very unattractive.I ended up returning all these items because I ordered them for use in my newly remodeled kitchen.  I planned on using it behind my toaster oven and coffee maker so the plugs would be recessed and I could push the appliances flush up against the wall.  The outlet would still be visible however, and I just couldn't bring myself to have these tacky and cheapy looking outlets in my new and sleek kitchen.Cooper makes a single gang recessed outlet box which is finished very nicely, but I was looking for a 2 gang box which could accommodate larger chunky plugs.To date, despite hours of searching online and consulting with contractors and hardware store workers, I have yet to find an attractive double gang recessed outlet box.

"First of all, this is a wonderful, clean, strong and genius idea for keeping unsightly necessities out of sight.  I purchased two of these -- one for my rag, and the other for my dishwashing gloves.The magnet is strong, yet allows for adjustments and changing your mind as to placement.  These magnets are so strong, I'm not even using the adhesive backing on the back magnet. In fact, once in place without the adhesive, it's possible to make adjustments by slowly wiggling the sink half of the magnet - - - the undersink magnet will follow.  I love how the bar itself, swivels and also lifts off the magnet base.This makes for very easy cleaning and wiping of the sink walls.  I keep the bar and the rag flush against the sink to keep it out of sight during the day, but swing it out at night to allow for max airflow around the rag overnight - - - completely dry in the morning and no more stinky damp rags.A couple of tips:- I asked users about the possibility of using this through wood (on the side of a cabinet).  No one knew for certain, but the consensus seemed to be ""no"".  They were right.  Although you can feel a slight ""attraction"" through the side cabinet panel, there was not enough strength to hold up the bar itself, let alone hold the weight of even a small towel.- I purchased this for a light remodel replacing counter tops and also changing out our old enameled cast iron sink with a stainless steel sink.  The cloth holder obviously works perfectly with our new stainless sink, but surprisingly, it worked by itself (without the back magnet) with our old enameled sink.  If I had given it a minute of thought, I would have realized the old sink is enamel over cast iron, so duh . . . of course it would work.But . . . for anyone else out there who may not have thought this through, be pleasantly surprised that if using in a cast iron sink, you won't even need to place the second backing magnet - - - it works without it.Absolutely love this, as well as the sponge holder I also purchased.

"My dad likes it ... My cat LOVES it!Purchased this for my dad who has a tailbone injury.  Although he likes it for use on softer surfaces like on the sofa or his lounge chair, he prefers the Cushy Cloud coccyx cushion (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NHYT36I/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)to use in his wheelchair, in the car, and on other firmer seats.My cat however, absolutely loves this.  Her legs and tail fit perfectly in the channels of the cushion and  she actually aligns herself so all her legs and her tail have their own slot.  Additionally, because her weight (10#) isn't enough to smash the peaks, we think she probably gets some sort of massage or acupressure sensation from it.  We notice she will settle down on it, then roll her head, shift her body and purr like she's getting a massage.If my dad is sitting on it, she will jump on the armrest and stare at him until guilt takes over and he gives her the cushion.

"Using to create two levels for stacking coffee cups in upper cabinets.These are sturdy, strong and stable.What I especially like about these, is that the shelving is a perforated metal material.  The typical vinyl coated racks have a grid that is spaced fairly wide.  For dishes, that's fine ... but any items with a smaller base (like cups, glassware or spice jars) tend to tip or topple.  This flat and stable shelf does not create that problem and is wonderfully solid.The small perforated holes still allow for airflow, if that's a concern.My upper cabinets are standard depth, and both these racks fit perfectly.  They are slightly shallower than the depth of the cabinet which makes perfect sense because it allows this top shelf to sit slightly offset from the items stored below.  This means no bumping your hand on the top rack when reaching in for something below it.On an aesthetic note, I have white dishware in white cabinets and the matte silver color of these racks are subtle and understated.Specifics to note: These are two separate racks in two slightly different sizes. They are fixed in size and do not literally expand in any way except that you can nest one under the other.  If you pull the bottom one out, I guess that would ""expand"" the usable surface area, except that the surface area would not be at the same height.They come fully assembled and the legs have rubber tips on them (comes w/ a bag of several extras too) to prevent scratching your cabinets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLHCNWYFF3C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFKZVOI#wasThisHelpful","RWLHCNWYFF3C0","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this for my 86 yr old dad who came out of an extended hospital stay very weak and unstable. He is 5'6"" and the fixed seat height, adjustable seat back and handles perfectly suit him.Although this is a bit more expensive than some other models we looked at, there were several reasons we chose this over the others.Pros:- It folds side-to-side rather than front-to-back.  This allows you to fold it to a narrower width to go through a narrow doorway.  It also means that even when it's completely folded closed, it is still standing on 4 wheels and will stand on its' own (no need to find a wall to lean it up against).My dad will go on walks with my mom and primarily uses only a cane.  They take this rollator along on their walks, so when/if he tires and needs to sit and rest, they will always have a seat available.  They take this along with them in its' folded position.  My mom rolls it alongside her as she walks - - holding onto the seat frame (instead of one handle) makes for easier steering alongside.- The zippered pouch behind the seat is surprisingly handy.  Throw in a bottle of water, light jacket, hat . . . my dad doesn't have a purse, but when my mom's with him, she sticks her purse in the pouch too.- A cinch to assemble.  One person, 15 minutes, done.- Lightweight.  Had to be lightweight enough that either my 86 yr old dad, or 81 yr old mom could comfortably fold, open, maneuver, load in/out of their car.- The included cane holder attaches to the side of the rollator, and is also surprisingly handy.- Curb lever on both back wheels allows easy transition up a curb without lifting - - step on the lever, pull back on the handles and the front wheels raise to step up on the curb.Cons:- Just my personal preference, but I wish the ""Drive"" logo that's embroidered on the backrest wasn't so large and noticeable.  Nurses, doctors, physical therapists at the rehab center, and perfect strangers have all approached dad to ask about it.  Trust me, this rollator is unique enough and we've gotten enough people come up to us to ask about it, that a large advertisement logo on the backrest isn't necessary.- Unlike the Nitro model, these brake cables are external (rather than integrated into the frame).  We chose this model purely for aesthetic reasons, as we liked this color combo.  Quite honestly, these external cables wrap and tuck themselves around the frame so well, the fact that they are external is not an issue at all. They don't stick out and there is no danger that they'll catch or snag on things at all.In summary, great purchase, safe, sturdy and very helpful aide in dad's recovery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5EPIO8P4JBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOZEJI#wasThisHelpful","R2S5EPIO8P4JBG","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the only plug in motion sensor light fixture I could find that uses standard or fluorescent bulbs.  I mounted it in the garage and wanted to plug it into the ceiling outlet that the garage door opener is plugged into.  There is no junction box on the ceiling, so that's why it was necessary to find a corded fixture.Too bad this fixture doesn't work as it's supposed to.Motion sensor triggers with movement as it should, but the light stays on less than 15 seconds no matter which setting you have it on.  There is a choice of test mode, 1 minute, 5 minutes or 10 minutes . . . no matter which setting it's on, the light goes out after 15 seconds.Returned it, then had an idea . . . could I retro-fit a hardwired fixture with a plug in cord?I went to Lowes, asked for some guidance, and bought a basic, regular hard-wired motion sensor floodlight, and a 16 gauge replacement cord.Items are similar to these:http://smile.amazon.com/Dewalt-DW540-DW704-Dw705-Power/dp/B00NVDUQZC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1420592056&sr=8-5&keywords=16+gauge+replacement+cordhttp://www.lowes.com/pd_182199-85538-SH-5412-WH-A_0__?productId=50236473&Ntt=motion+sensor+flood+lights&pl=1&currentURL=%3FNtt%3Dmotion%2Bsensor%2Bflood%2Blights&facetInfo=The only thing that posed a few minutes of head scratching, was how to mount it with no junction box.  The wired fixture that I returned, came with a mounting plate, but this hard-wired fixture is meant to be screwed directly into a junction box mounting bracket.I improvised and screwed the mounting bracket directly into the ceiling, then mounted the fixture to the bracket as instructed.  I also needed to drill a center hole in the drywall ceiling to accommodate the extra length of the machine screw going through the mounting bracket.Voila - - works perfectly and looks great - - - doesn't look at all like a Frankenstein hack.Even the guy at Lowe's wondered why there aren't more plug-in versions of this kind of light.

"We'd been using a normal collar and leash for our indoor cat whenever we let her come outside with us on our back deck.  She's very comfortable wearing a collar, and we didn't have any concerns until she managed to squeeze under the deck and slide a couple feet to the dirt below.  That wouldn't have been of concern, except that the leash didn't reach the entire way.Luckily, the leash was only a few inches too short and she was able to stand on her back legs until we could reach her.  We saw it happen, so we reacted immediately.That scare is what prompted us to shop for a harness.This harness has been working perfectly for us.  Both neck and waist straps are easily adjustable and the extra strap around her stomach doesn't seemed to bother her at all.  I think, the fact that this does not have anything that sits on her chest, is what makes it comfortable for her.We also tried a vest style of harness, and a strap version that had a chest strap.  Both of these styles bothered her because the vest and the chest strap got in the way when she settled down to groom herself - - she didn't like not being able to lick her chest.A slight con, is that the leash and clasp rests on the cat's back, rather than hang from under their chin.  This seems to bother her a teeny bit, but this is where a leash is secured with any type of harness-style device.The clasps are easy for me to snap on and squeeze off, but my husband sometimes has a bit of a problem with his larger hands.I'm not sure I'd feel completely comfortable leaving her unattended outside, but for spending family time outdoors with us, I'm very happy with this harness.Overall, a secure, cute and comfortable way to keep kitty safe and happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7YKV2VFYV0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035H7LZC#wasThisHelpful","R3J7YKV2VFYV0C","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They couldn't figure it out either.Kudos to Amazon - - - spoke to a rep on the phone and she was super in providing full return authorization.Although the price was lower here on Amazon, I decided I'd purchase the replacement directly from Verizon so I'd have their warranty and accessibility should anything else go wrong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QW87L0ZJECSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1W8JW#wasThisHelpful","R3QW87L0ZJECSP","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband has elbow bursitis.  Although he hasn't had to have surgery, he's had to have his elbow drained several times in the past couple of years.His doctor told him that having to aspirate might possibly be avoided by compression and icing at the first signs.Most other compression sleeves are pull-on styles that don't allow for using with an ice pack.The style of this brace, works great for both icing and compression.A small ice pack will sit nicely in the cupped section of the elbow brace, and the velcro straps are long enough even with the pack in place.  To wear for compression, although the main portion of this brace is not stretchy, the velcro straps are.  This allows you to strap it as loosely or as tightly as you need.Since purchasing this, he's had 2 situations that he's felt the bursitis flaring up (inflammation, ache).  At the first sign of flare up, he used this brace with ice and as a compression brace  . . . after 2 days, all signs of the bursitis were gone and his elbow was back to looking and feeling normal again.Much more comfortable and convenient than a trip to the doctor!If I had to cite a con for this item, it's that the velcro holds very, very strongly.  That's good - - - however, because it attaches directly to the brace itself (not to another velcro strip), the material of the brace is already fuzzy and showing signs of wear (aesthetic only, no affect on the integrity of the brace).  If we were concerned more about how this looks, this would be an issue, but for us, this is a very, very minor point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BTFHMJH3XVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGGQP9I#wasThisHelpful","R22BTFHMJH3XVK","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dad's cardiologist suggested he wear these during long car and airplane trips.  He was told that he could use either the thigh high or knee high styles.  Because he also tends to get cold easily, he opted for the thigh high so they'd also serve as thermals to keep him warm.First of all, he is very pleased with these.  They feel good on his legs, do serve to keep him warm and he wears them everyday and not only when he is traveling. The top band is thick, good quality, does not roll down or bind, and stays up comfortably all day long.Realizing they need to be tight in order to serve their purpose though, they are very difficult to put on.  He is 80 yrs old, and it's not very agile.  He has difficulty bending over and needs my mom or me to help him put these on.  The most difficult part is getting them on his foot and past his heel.  Once they're above his ankle, he can manage to pull them up by himself.The instructions and drawings are not very good, but this is what we've found works easiest for us:Turn them inside out, invert just the foot-to-heel portion, slip your foot into that section until the sock heel meets your heel.  Then, inch the rest of the sock up your leg.It's still not easy, but it's easier than trying to pull these on like you would regular socks or hose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX31J5N33EOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A33H6Q#wasThisHelpful","R2UX31J5N33EOO","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely amazing price for a huge bag of dried shiitakes.  Honestly . . . dried mushrooms are light as feathers, and a pound of feathers is a very large bag . . . roughly the size of a large bag of potato chips.I found though, that there are more hard stems and non-uniform sized pieces than are usually found in other packaged brands.In more expensive packaged brands, I find that I still have to cut and discard hard stems.  Although this brand has more stems that are inedible and tough, the caps rehydrate perfectly and the taste is great, so the cost value is still worth the little extra work.Also, although the description says ""slices"", realize that the slices and pieces are not at all, uniform in size or shape.  Again, for me this is not an issue, but if you are looking for uniform pieces for aesthetic purposes, this may not suit your needs.Overall though, I think the few more stems that need to be cut away, and random sized slices still make this a great value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCZCGG44ZUOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RAM4YQ#wasThisHelpful","RUCZCGG44ZUOC","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great capacity, light weight and comfortable to use, and rubber lip makes it easy to sweep up small debris without leaving a trail behind.Although the size and bright color of the bin makes this not so easy to just tuck away and hide in a corner, the utility of it outweighs this minor inconvenience.We have a smaller version - -  like the ones they use in hair salons and hotel lobbies.  Although it was easily stowed out of sight in a corner, the small size meant frequent trips to the large trash bin for emptying.I bought two of these large dust pans specifically to use for sweeping up leaves on our back yard deck and in our driveway.  The swivel handle means that when the bin is positioned vertically on end, it sort of acts like a bucket to contain the debris in.  That is, if I don't fill it in one use, I can position the bin on end and sit it in the corner till the next day without worrying about the debris spilling out.

"My kitty loves chicken and loves chewy things.  I've tried similar chicken treats that are marketed for cats, but although she will eat them, she only does so halfheartedly.Not so with this treat.As they come packaged, the strips are a little large for a cat, so I cut them (with a scissors) lengthwise in three narrower strips.  They end up roughly the width of a fettuccine noodle.  She will carry it around in her mouth for a while, then settles down, holds it between her paws like a dog would a bone, and eats it right up.The consistency and texture is moist, not crispy and crumbly like many others, and is made with only quality ingredients with no grain fillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIPS3FMS3C2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BZOFCO#wasThisHelpful","R1XIPS3FMS3C2A","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a 6-8.  I typically wear a M, but wanted this cami to sleep in, so went one size up and ordered a L.Taking it out of the package was shocking . . . it looked like doll clothing, it was so tiny.  Thinking that perhaps the fabric was extremely stretchy, I tried it on.The length barely came down to my navel, and the fabric cut in uncomfortably tightly under my arms.  I gave it to my 11 year old niece and it fits her well although even if this was marketed as a childs cami, the sizing would probably still be on the small side.I will say that the construction was good, and the fabric was very soft and cottony.  It is not lined, nor does it have a bra shelf, but the fabric is thick enough so even wearing it alone, will provide enough coverage to provide comfortable modesty.If this came in an XXL, the quality and price would make it worth taking a chance and ordering another one.

"I don't know if it's even realistic to expect no movement at all from a rug that's on carpet, but using this rug pad, there is very little movement at all.Most important though, is there is absolutely no buckling or rippling, which is a tripping hazard and can be dangerous.The rug this is on, is in our carpeted bedroom alongside our bed.  There is no furniture sitting on the rug, so the only thing keeping it in place is this rug pad.Every week or so, I notice about an inch of the rug pad peeking out from under the rug.

"As much as I hated to put a case on this beautiful phone, it's very slippery and I'd rather have a case on it than see the screen shattered after an inevitable drop.I love this case.  It's a stiff plastic and is shockingly tight and difficult to put on - - - and that is a good thing.  If I'm going to put a case on a phone, I want it to stay on and not gap at the sides or slip around in my hand.  Truly though, it's not easy putting this case on.  Start at the bottom, work your way up the sides, and use a credit card like a shoe-horn to ease the case up and on over the last corner.Once on, it's great.  It adds very little to no bulk, has a nice tactile feel to it that allows grip without a tacky gel feeling, still smooth enough to make slipping in/out of pockets (even tight jeans pockets) easy, cutouts are perfect, and mine has large camera lens/flash cutout that doesn't interfere with awesome flash photos.My previous phone had a case on it that I could slip on/off a little easier.  My previous case was also solid black.  I would keep a $20 in case of emergencies.This new case is not only too tight to make doing this practical, but I ordered the black/clear case which would not be very good at ""hiding"" the $20 anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRXKPT95Q6K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ0R02Y#wasThisHelpful","RWRXKPT95Q6K7","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dad has a difficult time hearing dialogue while watching movies.  Without spending thousands on a full scale home theater system, this sound bar provides super dialogue clarity and dimension to their Sony Bravia.Kudos to Vizio for including every cable necessary for installation.If I have one complaint, it is that for some reason, Vizio does not provide codes for programming with a Comcast remote.  I've tried every suggestion I can find (online blogs, customer support etc), but cannot find a compatible code that will allow just using the one Comcast remote for everything.  (Harmony works, but it's too complicated for my parents in their 80's)** Update : 8 months after purchase, the remote went inop.  After no success trying the obvious battery change and unplug/plug in again, I called vizio support.  I was pleasantly surprised by their helpfulness and the congenital and lengthy time that they spent with me.The tech admitted that vizio remotes are their weak link, so he had several things for me to try.1 - unplug/plug in again (already tried that)2 - Reset: 5 second press and hold of the bottom and the middle buttons on the sound bar (the volume down & the Bluetooth buttons)3 - The last thing he talked me through was very detailed, but it worked:Unplug ... Take out remote batteries ... Press every button on the remote ... Plug back in ... Put batteries back in remote ... turn on using button on sound bar ... Test volume using remote.It worked, and the tech told me this should be the one and only time I had to go through all these steps.  If it ever went out again, I'd just need to do either the first or second method.FYI, it has gone inop several times since (it'll do this maybe once every couple of months), but the tech was right, and have only needed to either just unplug or reset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VO8NUJAD9NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO07C5U#wasThisHelpful","R14VO8NUJAD9NX","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third of this same faucet that I have purchased for several of our rental units.The price is absolutely a bargain for a faucet of this quality.  Even our contractor has commented on the heft and quality of the parts.  He has also commented on how impressed he is with the inclusion and quality of all connectors and lines needed for installation.The water pressure is strong using both the spray and stream settings.An additional feature I appreciate, is the versatility of installation options.  The on/off lever can be positioned on any side without compromising operation or appearance.  This is helpful if any there are any other dispensers, spigots, or sink accessories that may interfere with the lever.For example, we installed one faucet with the lever on the left because the soap dispenser was on the right.  Another faucet was installed with the lever facing forward because it was centered in the middle of a divided sink.The included soap dispenser feels sturdy and operates well too.Very high end feel, look and construction at a fraction of the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y9NCAH65ATT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036GG57C#wasThisHelpful","R1Y9NCAH65ATT2","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Within the first several hours of receiving delivery of a new leather sofa, kitty jumped up and was surprised at how slick the leather was as compared to our old fabric sofa.  She slid off and left behind 2 small nicks and several claw skid marks.I am vehemently opposed to declawing, so with fingers crossed, gave this a try.Kitty is a 4 year old with tons of energy and personality.  In other words, she is not one to just lay limp in your arms and let you do anything to her.Not knowing if I'd be able to apply all 10 in one sitting, I first only filled 5 of the covers.  We ended up being able to apply them all, and it wasn't a problem taking a short break in between to fill the next 5.Notes:- It was easier with two of us - - husband to brush and distract kitty, and me to apply.  I think it helped a lot that we already trim her nails regularly, so she is used to having her paws touched and handled.  Alternately, I have also easily managed to replace single nails that have fallen off while she is napping and fast asleep.- Instructions say fill 1/3 full with glue however, it's not easy to see just how much glue is in each nail.  I used the glue sparingly at first.  That evening while she was playing with her mouse, 2 covers fell right off.  I replaced them and this time filled them more closely to 1/3 full as directed.I overfilled one of them and a little of the glue oozed out onto some of the fur around her toe.  I wiped it off quickly, but a teeny bit of fur stuck to the soft claw.  This really bothered her and she pulled that soft claw off right away.  My husband said it probably felt like arm hair caught in a watchband.- Before and after filling with glue, squeeze open each soft claw so they slip more easily onto each nail.- I tried using my fingers, then also tried using tweezers to put on each soft claw.  I found tweezers to be much easier - - more control, and easier to see what you're doing without fingers in the way.-  I ordered the clear because I purposely did not wish them to be noticeable.  As a side note however, if the covers were brightly colored, you could tell if any covers had fallen off with just a quick glance at each paw.  If one had fallen off, it would also be easier to spot around the house.-  After 2 weeks, one cover fell off.  A week later, we found another on the floor.  Both had nail sheaths stuck inside them.  This tells us that they work as they are designed to - - - that is, the covers fall off because the nails had grown and their sheaths had shed.  Sure enough, the bare nails were long and needed to be trimmed before new covers were put on.Caution however, not to trim the nails too short.  If you do, it doesn't leave enough nail surface for the glue to adhere to and the Soft Claw will quickly fall off.In summary :  Other than when the glue oozed out of the one claw, kitty hasn't tried to pull off a single cover.  In fact, she truly doesn't seem to even notice she has them on.They are a complete and perfect solution and everyone is happy.  Couldn't ask for anything more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12U4YHNMLWVI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006343W2#wasThisHelpful","R12U4YHNMLWVI1","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are not many dual band bluetooth transmitters, so I gave this one a try.I will say that syncing and connectivity were a snap, so if using for its intended purpose, this device would probably be great.In our situation, it wasn't acceptable for the main reason that even with aptx connectivity, there was still too much latency for tv watching.  Although delay was minimal and not noticeable if listening to music, the audio delay when paired with video, was uncomfortable.Additionally, for some reason, our headsets would not remember and recognize this device from one time to the next.  There were occasional-to-frequent signal drops, and re-syncing every time, was just not feasible.I am still giving this 4 stars because the setup is very intuitive, transmission was strong and device feels very solid and durable.If our frustrations came mainly because we were trying to use this for purposes other than it was intended, then it's not fair to negatively critique this device on that basis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9IQ1HMXSM56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NB53S#wasThisHelpful","RD9IQ1HMXSM56","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My existing stainless steel dish rack is solid and still in perfect condition however, the utensil holder that came with it had started to rust.This works great as a replacement caddy. The clear plastic feels sturdy, hooks right onto my rack like it was made for it, and aesthetically blends in, matches the rack, and doesn't look like an ""add on"".The three compartments are divided so utensils stay upright and don't slide through from one slot to another.  There are drain holes at the bottom so water does not sit in the holder.The depth is perfect for utensils however, some of my longer serving spoons and cooking utensils are top heavy and lean over.My other holder was a bit deeper and practically sat on the sink bottom.  That it was deeper meant that longer utensils stood upright however, because it was deeper, it actually sat on the sink bottom and sometimes knife tips would poke through the bottom and hit through to the sink.This one works better overall and I am very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R820HKLFK07QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000Y7ZV8#wasThisHelpful","R820HKLFK07QO","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an ipod with bluetooth transmitter in the house . . . this speaker goes outside in the garden with us.Setup and sync is a snap, speaker itself is solid, quite heavy for it's size, has easy and intuitive controls, nice shape and grippy bottom for stability and easy handling, and super sound.Wow, did I mention the sound? - - - super impressive sound from this little thing.  Actually, super impressive sound even if it was coming from a speaker twice its size.  It truly surprises with its bass, clarity and depth of sound.We have it turned up about half its max volume, and that's plenty enough volume for background music in our small garden.Battery life has been not quite the 12 hrs as advertised.  Although I haven't actually timed it, roughly estimating that it lasted about 9 hours of straight play.I now make it a habit to bring it in after a full day's use and recharge it so it's ready for the next day.I believe that bluetooth range is depleted when connectivity goes through walls.  Our transmitter is in the house, and the speaker is outside.  Given this situation with physical walls/windows between the transmitter and the receiving speaker, we find the connectivity range is roughly 15 feet, rather than the advertised 30 feet.  This is still pretty impressive though, and no complaints (only fyi) by mention of this here.All that being said, I enthusiastically give this 5 stars for its sound, size, solidness and price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32J4RSW1GG7V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY316WQ#wasThisHelpful","R32J4RSW1GG7V6","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes you get what you pay for, and sometimes you get much, much more than you imagined.  The latter is the case here!Snap one end in, then work the other 3 sides around the nano.  Fit is snug on all 4 sides.All ports buttons are perfectly aligned and accessible.The case has a grippy-yet-rigid feel which makes this little nano easier to hold onto.  Being that the nano is so lightweight, this seems like it would easily give good protection from accidental bumps and drops.I especially like the TPU material, which is more rigid and solid than others that are soft silicone and gummy-bear-like.I ordered the clear, which is actually translucent and not clear as glass.  My nano is silver, so this is fine with me however, if you have a colored nano and wish to retain the clarity of color, take note of this.An added plus to this already insanely low price, is that this also comes with a screen protector.

"Wanted a motion sensor light for the area around the door from the house into the garage. We have tons of overhead lights in the garage, but sometimes all we need is a minute of light to just run to the mail slot or drop something in the trash can - - - kind of a waste to turn on all the overhead lights just for that.Asked our handyman to install one single separate switched light, but he said we'd need to call an electrician to run conduit.  Not worth the $ to do all that, so decided to try this.Am so glad I did.It's perfect, works reliably every time, and sheds plenty enough light in our dark garage for our needs.  The motion sensor works great! I have it mounted on the ceiling about 3 feet from the entry door and the movement of the door opening is enough to trigger the sensor.  This is great because when you open the door, the light is already on - - - no standing on the landing having to wave your hands in order to trigger the sensor.The light stays on for about 30 seconds, and sheds a comfortable warm/white light (unlike the uneasy blueish light of other LED's).Side note about the necessity of complete darkness for this to work - - - I bought two of these lights.  One for our garage and another for a rental property garage.  Our garage has 2 small 5"" diameter metal grid light/vent holes in our garage door.  It lets in a little light, but not enough to be useful.Our rental property has a 2 bulb fluorescent garage fixture that is left on 24/7.  It's on the opposite side of our 3 car garage, and it's light doesn't quite reach the entry door area.In both garages, the extra existing light does not affect the function of these, so the warning that the area needs to be in complete darkness, is actually not true.I just put these up, so have no history for longevity of batteries, but at least access to the unit is easy (mounting bracket screws into ceiling, light twist onto bracket) when a battery change is needed.*** battery life update:  almost 3 months later and batteries needed to be changed.  When you notice the lights are not as bright as usual, that's a sign the batteries need replacing.  Being that our light is probably activated an average of around at least 10x a day, I'm very pleased with this 3 month life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYXC812ZZAVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X099V0#wasThisHelpful","R3AYXC812ZZAVW","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Am using this so my father can hear audio from tv without blasting the volume up so high as to drive everyone else out of the room.Truly easy set up.  Plug into power, plug into audio out on tv, select frequency and tune in!  The only adjustment I had to make is turning down the volume on this transmitter to erase static.  Just tune in, notice any static, and adjust volume control on transmitter until static clears.Used this transmitter, ""radio-channel.com"" to find vacant fm station, iPod nano 7th generation as an fm receiver, and earbuds of our choice.There is a micro minuscule delay in audio, and if the tv volume is off, it's completely unnoticeable.  News, sports or talk shows are also less noticeable than movies or programs with background soundtracks.  You don't notice it visually (lips and audio are in synch), just the slightest of an echo delay if tv speakers are up.If anyone else is watching with him and listening through the tv speakers, noticing the delay is avoided by using noise canceling earbuds.If he's watching sports or the news, he uses regular earbuds (or sometimes just puts one side in).  This way he can still hear enough ""outside"" noise to be social, talk and comment about the news or game with us.When watching movies or tv shows however, he switches to his noise canceling earbuds.We previously tried a bluetooth solution to this problem.  Not only was latency horrible with that, but whenever he walked out of the room, bluetooth would drop off and we'd often even have to re-pair the device.  Using fm transmission, he can leave the room, go get a snack, visit the restroom ... all without missing anything.The biggest expense with this solution is the ipod nano, so you could cut your cost greatly by using a much less expensive fm receiver  --- ie, a regular fm pocket radio, instead of the iPod nano --- but, we wanted something small and digital.Here are the components we used:SainSonic AX05B transmitter - $62IPod nano 7th generation - $140 (only generations 5-7 have fm receivers)Earbuds of choiceHappy family now!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7J89KMLGDGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096KY9YS#wasThisHelpful","R3J7J89KMLGDGC","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this to power a charging station I have set up in the corner of the counter.  The charging station houses 2 ipads, 2 android phones, and 2 nanos (the nanos have to share).  The charging station is a space-saver on the counter, but I had a jumble of plugs all jammed into a power strip against the wall.The charging station eliminated the eyesore of cords and devices strewn all over the counter.  The octupussy mess of cords against the wall however, were hard to hide.  I tried hiding it behind a decorative bowl, but then I found this.It's perfect!Most devices come with usb chargers that plug into wall adapters anyway, so just being able to get rid of the wall plugs saved tons of space right off the start.The shape of this is smartly styled to sit flat against the wall, and the 5 usb ports are not all powered equally.  They are labeled to coordinate with their power ratings, ie. ipad, tablet, android, etc.I haven't tested the amperage, but I followed the labels when plugging in my usb cables, and I can validate that it successfully and consistently charges all 5 devices - - - all at the same time, and all at standard speed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9I9LB10DR4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOWUO0O#wasThisHelpful","RV9I9LB10DR4V","A3G07AKUPSTJU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G07AKUPSTJU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for an extension to add length to your headset, this is not for you.I wanted just the opposite.  I did not want added length to easily get tangled, but I did want to use the earbuds of my choice and still be able to control the volume without having to fish my ipod out of my pocket.Pros: short length, easy to control volume dial (more control than sliding, or arrow up/down styled ones), good range of mute thru fairly high volume, adjusting the volume is seamless (no static or cutting out)Cons: not the strongest feeling cord material.Volume dial is a ""loose"" spin which makes it easy to control, but I have also brushed against the dial a couple of times and have changed the volume just by doing soOverall, I am extremely pleased with this inexpensive solution to the minor annoyance I had of having to retrieve my device anytime I wanted to adjust the volume.

It also shows how the non believer found his way to Christ by listening to his friend study the Bible and share his word.

"I live in Georgia and remember see this on the news as a lot of it unfolded and this is an incredible story. I think many will find it as a controversy and some will see it as a blessing from God and I think all is true in that respect, I feel so bad for the families that lost love ones during this ordeal and I am thankful he chose to stop with Ashely and wish he has chose to not have taken the very first life at all.Ashley's captor's name was Brian Nichols and he escaped from an Atlanta courthouse, killing several people in the process. Before he was able to take her hostage. He then held her hostage in her own apartment for seven hours, and she talked him into surrendering peacefully by witnessing to him about her family, her faith, and her life turnaround. At the time, Ashley was a 27 year old widow, whose husband had been murdered as a result of a fight about drugs. As a meth addict herself, Ashley was beginning to get her life together and trying to get things together for her 5 year old daughter, whom she hadn't had custody of for over two years. She as given a copy of Purpose Driven Life, threw the book away, and the woman who gave it to her pulled it out of the trash and gave it to her again. God definitely wanted Ashley to have that book as a tool for her immediate future as well as her life generally.She credits God for many miracles that took place during her ordeal with Brian. This includes the fact that Brian did not kill her, even though he had already killed four people just a few hours earlier. An additional amazing fact was that he eventually let her go, unharmed. Even more of her prayers were answered when Brian was taken into custody without anyone else being hurt.A product sample was supplied to me, by Flyby Promotions for my listening pleasure to give my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DGCGZOK6UZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062439200#wasThisHelpful","R28DGCGZOK6UZQ","A2NLGNI51G6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NLGNI51G6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Five stars for the products, minus one star for the lack of any packaging...This is an excellent way to try new-to-you products from Burt's Bees. While it is a ""set,"" it isn't a ""gift set.""  There is no packaging and the items are tossed loose in a padded envelope. You could always buy a gift bag and some ribbon to make it into a gift set, if you are so inclined.As far as the products go...1. Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser: I LOVE this face wash.  I have been using it for 1-2 years and have it on Subscribe & Save on Amazon since the local drugstores' prices are $3+ more a tube.  It truly is like washing your face with cream.  It is super moisturizing and I don't have dry skin at bedtime since using this.  Less dry skin means less chance of wrinkles.2. Coconut Foot Cream: Nicely scented but definitely not a ""cream.""  It is more like a Vaseline texture.  I don't like that consistency but if you do, it is quite hydrating.3. Deep Cleansing Cream:  It is a fine face wash but a bit more drying than the Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser.  I will be sticking with my favorite but this may be good for younger teen faces that are a constantly oily.4. Milk and Honey Body Lotion:  I really enjoy the scent of this one and the lotion goes a long way.  I will be re-purchasing to use on my arms and legs before bed.  The scent is perfect to snuggle up to.5. Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream: I really like the consistency and the level of moisture but am not a fan of the smell.  I won’t be purchasing this in a larger size unless they have another scent.6. Intense Hydration Day Lotion: Very thick and a little goes a long way with this product too. I actually like this in a unique way.  The texture feels different than most lotions I've tried and I enjoy the difference... maybe because it is novel?  So far, I have not had any breakouts from this and will update if I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4E0AWIETFPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0XQAU0#wasThisHelpful","R3O4E0AWIETFPY","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We screwed the rack in the studs and didn't have to use the included drywall anchors.  In order to make the process easier we:- Used a stud finder- Marked the holes of the first rack with a pencil- Pre-drilled holes for the one rack only- Screwed in the first rack- Used a broom handle and a level to ensure the rack was going to be straight- Marked the second holes with a pencil, after ensuring it was level- Pre-drilled holes for the second rack- Screwed in the second rackIt only took a few minutes to do the extra steps of pre-drilling and leveling and, in the end, saved us a ton of time, ensured we didn't make a mistake, and made the process smooth and easy.  The board is super secure, gives the room a ""surfer vibe"" and I no longer have to move the board to vacuum the room or worry it will be knocked/tripped over.  It is easy to grab off the wall and surf with if you are mounting a board you use.

"I don't usually expect a ton from earbuds in the bass department (the over the head ""big"" type I do) however, these buds just proved me wrong.  I have a pair of $150+ headphones that sound stunning, however, the bass on them is almost non-existent.  These Bose, while still maintaining the stunning sound, have amazing bass for an in-ear pair of headphones and have a very true-to-recording sound.The earbuds themselves are extremely comfortable to wear, my ears never became fatigued or got sore, and they come with three sizes included: one pair of small, one pair of medium (pre-installed) and one pair of large.  For my tiny ear canals, the small fit perfectly.  Once in, they are quite noise canceling while music is playing.  Both my co-worker and child could not get my attention when I had music playing at an average level.As for the controls, everything worked beautifully with my iPhone 6 and I didn't run into any hiccups while using them for music or phone calls.Unfortunately, my teen stole these from me and is now begging to keep them for himself.  I love these earbuds so much that I will end up purchasing a pair for myself and give him this pair so mine don't keep going missing (sharing in-earbuds... ick!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PIWGMA9ZA5R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYDW#wasThisHelpful","R3PIWGMA9ZA5R5","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finish Tabs are my favorite dishwashing detergent. I have a very old dishwasher that still gets the job done and Finish seems to work the best in ol' faithful out of all I've the detergents I've tried. Finish Tabs gets off the grease and doesn't leave a film or white powder behind.The only thing I couldn't stand about the old version was that they were individually wrapped in foil wrappers. While the wrappers ensured that the detergent bricks wouldn't break apart in the box and wouldn't dissolve if the box got wet, those things were a pain to open with damp hands. I was also not a fan of touching the bleach/chemicals/whatever and would always scrub my hands after loading a tab in the dishwasher.

"Dove makes my favorite deodorants and I hadn't yet tried the Advanced Care line. Given my propensity to sweat, even in the winter and without exercise, I wasn't expecting this, or any, product to keep me dry for 48 hours. Since I shower every morning, I do not need my deodorant to last this long. I was surprised to find that on a day that I took a late shower, my underarms were still fresh and dry 36 hours later, which is quite impressive.My only reason to knock down a star was for the ""Clean"" scent. It is a personal preference but I did not love the floral scent of this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GB4PDGG8H85H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70R41U#wasThisHelpful","R3GB4PDGG8H85H","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My teen son was thrilled to receive this set.  Phoenix is his favorite scent in the AXE line and, as his mother, I don't find it offensive like some of the horrific things his teen friends wear.  This scent would, in my opinion, smell great on a grown man as well.  It doesn't scream ""I'm a teenager"" like some scents do.As for the products, he has worn the AXE solid antiperspirant for years and it has always kept him dry and smelling great.  The body wash works well, and the scent does linger a bit, but it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) for those who are looking to avoid it.  Finally, the spray... ohhhhhh the spray... it seems to be a *must* for any young teenager.  It is strong but in our house the rule is, it must be sprayed outside the house, away from the body, and then walked into.  This isn't for some great health reason, it is for my poor nose when it is stuck in a small vehicle with him I don't want gag on a fragrance bomb.  One of my favorite things about the spray is how it locks so it can't accidentally go off in a drawer and coat the inside and everything else inside the drawer.  This has happened on more than one occasion with a different spray.Overall, this is a great set.  It is labeled as a ""gift box"" but it is really just these three items in the cardboard box pictured above.  There is nothing special to make it a gift box (like a tin, fun inserts, etc.) but it is currently much cheaper to buy these in this set rather than individually.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R161LOGHI2IFGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLZJ9SE#wasThisHelpful","R161LOGHI2IFGV","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my teenage son's favorite of all the AXE deodorant scents.  He regularly uses the white/solid version of this deodorant and we figured we'd give this blue/clear one a shot.  This deodorant is great for days when you are wearing dark shirts and don't want to get white streaks on your shirt.  That said, he prefers the white one on days when the clear isn't needed.  The white one feels drier when it initially goes on and throughout the day.  No matter which one he uses, it keeps him smelling fresh and, for a guy who runs miles on the beach everyday, it keeps him dry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGI221XM4BV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBX99S0#wasThisHelpful","R3EGI221XM4BV4","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Revlon 1875 watt dryer that has been my holy grail appliance since 2006.  Lately, even though it is still working as well as the day I bought it, it has been giving off an ""electrical"" smell so I jumped at the opportunity to find a replacement for when the inevitable happens.Pros:- This thing BLOWS.  Not all 1875 watt dryers are created equal.  This thing blows harder and dries faster than my old dryer and I truly thought nothing could beat it.  I have several friends who are professional stylists with pro dryers and this blows stronger than those I tested it against, including my ""old faithful.""- Three heat settings.  My old dryer had two which was fine for most of the year, however, I have thick course hair and in the summer the hot was too hot and the cooler setting was not hot enough to get my hair smooth and dry in a reasonable time frame.  This is truly a Goldilocks case and third setting is ""just right"" for those scorching summer days.- The added concentrator and diffuser pop off and on pretty easily but stick on well enough that they will not fall off on their own.- The ""Cool Shot"" is necessary not only to finish my style but also to cool and dry off my hot face after a blow drying session.  I would never purchase a dryer without this option.  I use it every time after I finish drying my hair to add a smoothness and shine I don't get otherwise.Cons:- Weight.  While not the heaviest dryer I've used, it is heavier than my old dryer and will take some getting used to before I am comfortable with it.  The upside is that since this is a stronger and hotter dryer, my hair dries faster so I am not holding it as long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM0DDD72RSGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRN7SB8#wasThisHelpful","R3QM0DDD72RSGV","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!  I am very impressed with this travel mug.  Sure, it is rugged and hefty looking but, to my surprise, it also kept ice water cold for over 24 hours in 80+ degree temps (no direct sun).  The next day I wanted to see how it did with hot liquids and the mug kept my coffee hot throughout the work day.  As far as leaks, there were none, even when shaken upside down.  As someone who spends a large part of the workday driving around to people's homes, to have something that won't spill in the car and will keep my liquids hot or cold (depending on what I put in) while my car sits in the sun or fog (depending on the day) is invaluable.It is super easy to wash, simply take apart the lid and throw in the dishwasher.I am always looking for gifts for my hard-to-buy-for-dad and he will be getting one of these for Christmas this year... maybe in a basket with special coffee, smoked salmon, cheeses, and crackers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YYK6XGBA5DXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VG761C#wasThisHelpful","R2YYK6XGBA5DXI","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This antiperspirant does an excellent job keeping me dry and fresh smelling.  I recently had to travel to SoCal for my child's competition during a ridiculous heat wave which included a very rare, for California, level of extreme humidity.  I tried the Dove antiperspirant during our trip which was held out in the blazing sun for 9 hours.  My underarms still smelt baby powder fresh at the end of the day and, while I was sweating everywhere else, my underarms stayed dry.  Quite an accomplishment for this heavy sweater.My only note for those who are sensitive to smells is that the baby powder scent is pretty strong and does linger.  I, personally, am more than happy to smell floral-y rather than like death but I wanted to throw that out there for those with sensitive noses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32A3XAF4D4Z8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QKT2#wasThisHelpful","R32A3XAF4D4Z8A","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our family enjoyed the light scent, which didn't stick around post-shower, but found that we preferred the ""cream"" type Dove body washes better. Having been spoiled by the white/cream washes, which can even be used to shave with, this gel-based wash was not nearly as moisturizing or thick.I did like that the dispenser is at the bottom of the bottle so it is quick and easy to dispense, however, the bottom of the bottle is a bit narrower which makes it easy to knock over.

"A shelf is a must to get the maximum storage space out of your locker.  Binders and books easily fit under this shelf, in most cases with extra room to spare, and other items like sports equipment, lunch, notebooks, hats, etc. can go on top.  We stacked quite a bit on top and the shelf showed no signs of distress or buckling.The drawer, while a cool feature, was not designed all that well.  If you pull the drawer out and slightly up, the drawer will fall right out.  This could be a problem with those who have bottom lockers since they will be pulling the drawer up and out.  For those with middle or top lockers, it is more likely they will be pulling the drawer out and down and therefore, the plastic nubs will keep the drawer from falling out.  Due to this, I wouldn't store breakables or small objects that would be difficult to gather up inside the drawer, should it fall.The other concern with the drawer is that if you don't push it in quite straight, the drawer will go off its tracks.  It takes some jiggling to get it back in place.(A side note on the drawer, there are two holes in the  bottom of the plastic drawer that are slightly smaller than a hole punch.  If you are planning on using the drawer to store something itty bitty, it will likely fall through the two small holes.)My only other word of caution when purchasing this locker shelf is to ensure that it will fit well.  The shelf is wobbly, however, in a snug locker, it does not move/shake (since there is no room to do so).  In a wider locker it will wobble about an inch in each direction.Overall, it suits our needs.  It fits well in our high school's lockers, is able to handle a heavy load on top, and provides extra space for all the junk and school supplies that need to fit in.  The drawer will likely remain empty or be used for items that rarely need to be grabbed daily/quickly.  If it becomes a bigger hassle as time goes on, it can easily be removed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYXZPV2XTNXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NRC58#wasThisHelpful","R2UYXZPV2XTNXF","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using a corded non-Bluetooth headphones at work for the last few years to block out the office.  The problem is I am constantly flinging my iPhone off the desk when I turn my head or get up to grab things from other areas of the office.  The iPhone falls and the headphones rip out of my ears.  This has left me wanting to try a Bluetooth pair for awhile but I wasn't ready to spend $80+ on a pair for work.  When I was offered the chance to try these, I figured it would be a good way to see if Bluetooth headphones would be a better option.After several weeks using these at work, my thoughts are:- Pairing was super easy to do and they were paired to my iPhone 6 in just a few seconds- I love the zipper pouch these come in.  At the end of my day, I zip them up and throw them in my desk drawer- Different size earbuds.  The ones that come pre-installed on the headphones were much too large for my ears.  I put the smallest ones on, an easy task, and they fit perfectly.  Since the instructions that came with the headphones did not include how to put them on, I struggled a lot the first day to get them to stick in.  Now that I understand how they go in (thanks other reviewers for the pictures!) I pop them in, play my music, and start working.- They are comfortable. No complaints here on how they feel once in.  I can not stand hard plastic earbuds and these have a comfortable rubbery bud that fits snugly but comfortably.- Sound: For the price, they have a decent sound.  I don't struggle to hear the lyrics but they aren't as clear and bass heavy as my most expensive headphones.  For under thirty dollars, they are excellent.- And finally... they solved my problem that I had with the corded set.  I can get up, move around and don't have to worry about my iPhone falling and ripping the buds out of my ears.  I am extremely happy!I received this in exchange for a fair review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPP3S27T05P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","RPP3S27T05P6","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I chose this product due to the size as well as the quality I've come to expect from 5 Star products. While the quality is there, unfortunately, the notebook is not 8.5x11, the size of a standard piece of paper, and we do not have a use for a 9.5x6 notebook. All classes at our high school require a standard size page so this product will sit around until it gets tossed. Since the listing currently states the size as 8.5x11, this could be an expensive mistake for those who believe that is what they ordered.Now, if you are looking for a smaller notebook, the quality is amazing. There is a stretchy elastic loop that will hold a pen or pencil but will hold one with a good clip the best. The two subject dividers are movable which is ingenious since one subject always seems to need more paper than another. The rings are also covered by a thick sturdy fabric so the they don't catch on items in your backpack. The only downside to this 9.5x6 notebook is that there is only 100 sheets. For the price and size, it should be quite a bit thicker.If you are in the market for a 100 sheet 9.5x6 notebook, you probably won't find another with these awesome features and solid build.

"With a creek in our backyard, enjoying the yard in the summer requires some intervention.  This ""lantern,"" when lit up, matches my outdoor decor of blue Mason Jars filled with tealights and isn't noticeable as a insect repellent.  Other fans I have seen in stores are brightly colored, unattractive, and have huge brand-names written across them.The Cons:- Lantern is a misnomer.  This lantern barely lights up, more of a dull glow, but this may not be the worst thing in the world.  Light attracts bugs, the same thing the lantern is attempting to ward off.  It is strange, however, that the lantern has two settings.  One with the light and fan and a second setting for the light without the fan.  Given the minimal light, the second setting seems pointless. It would make more sense to have a fan with light option and a second option that has fan with no light.- Refills are, at this time, tough to find. Amazon sells them but they currently won't ship  for 2-4 weeks and the cost is insane compared to buying the lantern to begin with.  Refills, for those interested, can be found here: Stinger Mosquito Repellent Refills (2 Pack)The Pros:- DEET Free!  No nasty chemicals here.- Comes with batteries (always a huge plus in our family)- A fairly quiet fan.  Nothing that guests will have to scream over.- It works and looks cute doing it.  Mosquitoes are the only insects that fly in this part of California at night (besides the benign moths).

"Parchment paper is one of my favorite ""cheats"" in the kitchen. It saves so much clean up time (no scraping off burnt bits or trying to get oil residue off my pans) and you don't need to use a new sheet for each batch. The paper is strong enough to lift up cookies/brownies/etc. off the pan by grabbing the edges so they can quickly cool. Another plus is the calorie savings by not needing to oil/butter the pan. I've never had a recipe stick to parchment paper.While I regularly use the Reynold's Parchment Paper Rolls, I often find myself fighting the curling sheets. The fact that it is folded in fourths means that it lays flatter than the rolls. The downside is, it is precut so you may need to use more than one sheet for bigger cookie sheets or use scissors for smaller jobs. All of my cookie sheets are larger than these precut sheets which means I need to make smaller batches. You may want to take a peek at yours to determine if these will fit or if you would be better off using the roll.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZII2KN8S0QW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K282KY4#wasThisHelpful","RZII2KN8S0QW8","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the last two years I've used a Neato VX-11 and before that I owned, and used, a Roomba.  To me, the Neato has been the superior product at a lower price.  First, the Neato really does scan the room and creates a ""plan.""  It vacuums the perimeter of the room then goes back and forth in a straight pattern to vacuum the middle.  On the other hand, the Roomba just bounces around the room slamming into things and changing directions. The Neato doesn't often hit furniture as it ""sees"" it and will run alongside it.  The Roomba reminds me of a child who scribbles wildly outside the lines, occasionally coloring on the table.  The Neato is the child who traces the lines of the coloring book and meticulously colors in the lines, back and forth, not missing a single spot. (See photo of the beautiful straight lines the Neato leaves when finished.)Compared to the VX-11 model, here are the biggest improvements: - The dust bin!  As you can see from my photos, the larger dust bin was much needed.  While the D75 vacuum is the same size as the VX-11, the dustbin and filter are significantly bigger.  This was a complaint of mine with the VX-11.  I believe the larger dustbin is the reason the D75 cleans so much better than its predecessor.  The D75 does not fill up as quickly and, therefore, does not lose suction from being jam packed with debris.  Note: Before you judge my dustbin, I just had new carpet installed a few days prior and a professional vacuuming job was completed after the install.  We have been shoeless in the house since.  The photo shows how much crud the Neato was still able to suck up just from one really clean room.  Cat hair, human hair, wood chips, ants?!?!? (that's a situation that is about to be handled), sand, carpet fibers, etc.- The noise.  The D75 is significantly quieter than the previous model.  This was confirmed by my son who walked in and immediately commented on the sound, the cat who didn't run into the kitchen and jump on top of the refrigerator (as he ALWAYS did with the VX-11), and my mom who stopped by and also owns a VX-11.- Maneuvering.  The VX-11 would always get stuck in a couple key places if I didn't block them off.  Two spots in particular I sat waiting for the new D75 to get stuck in.  I was shocked when it made it in-and-out of the corner with the writing desk and made it underneath our ottoman.  Our VX-11 would always call out for help if I didn't block the desk with a chair and put the ottoman up before vacuuming.- The cord system.  The charging base has built-in channels that you can wrap the cord in to shorten and hide it.  This is much better than trying to shove it behind the charging base which makes the base stick out further from the wall.  Much appreciated from someone who hates seeing cords all over the house.- The look.  While I am not in love with the giant blue ""Neato"" on top (it doesn't light up), I like it much better than the dark gray and orange 80s thing that was happening with the VX-11.- Battery?  Since the VX-11 is over two years old, I can't remember how many rooms it cleaned before it needed to recharge when I first purchased it.  The D75 seems to last longer but it could be the old battery I am comparing it to.  The D75 can do two decent size rooms before needing to drive itself over to the docking station, without human assistance, to recharge itself and clean the rest of the house.Overall, I have been extremely happy with the Neato vacuums I've used, especially compared to the competition.  The D75 is even better than its predecessor since it has required no human intervention to get unstuck and the larger dustbin is so necessary.  While I haven't needed to call customer support for this vacuum, I did have to call for my previous vacuum and found the customer service representative to be patient, helpful, and fully met my needs.**** IMPORTANT: There is a lot of genius packed into this robot and it isn't your industrial 1950's vacuum that could stand up to nuclear destruction.  If I could leave you with one bit of advice, ALWAYS purchase the extended warranty when buying a robotic vacuum.  In my mind, it should be mandatory.  If something goes wrong, for less than 10% of the purchase price you can have it repaired or have your money refunded.  Buy the longest warranty offered.  You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KX4X7YT1XDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XELDQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R16KX4X7YT1XDC","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cover meets my needs. I have a couple of adirondack chairs in my backyard that are constantly exposed to the elements. On the coast of California, that mostly consists of sun, fog, and dust/dirt. While we are lacking snow and rain, chairs still will eventually fade, crack, warp, and are filthy.This heavy duty cover ensures that when company comes to visit, the chairs look clean and new. (And they don't end up leaving with a brown bottom!)In heavy wind, the cover stays on with no problem due to the buckle system AND the cinching around the bottom of the chair cover.While not waterproof, water does roll off with ease and will be great if we ever see rain again.I currently have two adirondack chairs stacked under this cover and, while the cover doesn't quite reach the ground when the chairs are stacked, it is more than enough to protect both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR51S461L23GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8C11VM#wasThisHelpful","RR51S461L23GS","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are a big gaming family with at least 40 board/card games in the house at this time.  While I've heard of Castle Panic and Munchkin, I had never played either (strange, I know, given their popularity with the gaming community).  Without an emotional attachment to either, I have to say, I really enjoyed this new addition to our cupboard!  Our family enjoys cooperative games, mostly because they are fairly rare, and enjoyed that even though we were ""forced"" to cooperate to survive, the game also had a competitive element.  Kudos to the game designer for the free, and optional, expansion pack to mix up game play which extends replayability.  At this time we have only played the game using the original instructions but there are also instructions for Solo Play, Easier Play, or Harder Play for those who want to customize the game to the age/skill level/number of people playing.This game will definitely make it out of our cupboard but won't be a in the regular rotation as often as I would like.  The game, while very fun and engaging, involves longer/detailed instructions and the game play lasts at least an hour.  There are rainy days (though few in California) that a game like this is perfect for.  Great for a long family night in or for a family cabin retreat!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193Q8PTQN7TX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R193Q8PTQN7TX1","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently redecorated a bathroom and have been looking for a curtain to match a lot of the taupe brown I brought in.  This ""Cool Brown"" matches beautifully.  It has a smidge of a gray hue, which I have been looking for (but not finding).  The subtle pattern and sheen make it more expensive looking than many other curtains I have been finding in my local stores.The curtain doesn't have metal grommets, which I prefer, as all of my old curtains have eventually ended up rusting (even when they promised they were ""rust free"").

"First, let me say that I had no idea how bad I was at throwing a frisbee .  I was seriously terrible!  After I practiced my aim for a couple days, this game became a blast.  It is being added to our beach bonfire games that we tote out on the sand every weekend because it:- Has a score keeper built into the post of the game (no need for pen and paper)- Has its own carrying case that easily is unpacked and packed up- Is easy to learn (though challenging to play!)- Easy to set upThis game is easy to play for a bit in between grilling burgers and can be stopped and resumed as needed.  You can easily modify the game to accommodate more people as the party grows.  Young children enjoy playing it (with the posts being closer together) and adults enjoy the challenge of a ""full court"" game.

"Update 2/7/15:Scheduling is now working on my Air Purifier!  I increased the stars to 3 since it is now a functioning product.  I never received assistance from WeMo Customer Service and I still don't love the look of the product which keeps off two stars.Original Review:I am so incredibly sad about this product.  I saw value in an connected/smart home air purifier.  I loved the idea of having it run on a schedule that wouldn't wake me up and I was thrilled that I would receive reminders about filter changes and maintenance (I have no idea when my other air purifier is due for a filter change... it is likely wayyyy past due).  Sadly, my experience has left me baggy-eyed.The WeMo app has the default schedule set as 7 days a week running from 5:28am to 5:28pm.  I opted to have it run beginning at 10am as to not be woken up by the noise.  Every time I would change the schedule back to 10am, the app would switch back to the default of 5:28am.  I spent the last several days woken up at 5:28am by the air purifier running full throttle (it is noisy at its highest speed!).It is currently Saturday so I had ""free"" time to contact customer service.  After nearly 20 minutes on the line, I was told that Tier I support could not help me beyond re-installing the app (did not fix the problem).  I was put on hold while Tier I spoke to Tier II support to see if I was worthy of being transferred to the next level.  In the end, Tier II would not speak to nor help me (per Tier I guy).  Tier I said that I would need to call Jarden customer service because WeMo/Belkin has no clue how to re-set the air purifier.If WeMo wants to start integrating their system into household products, they need to provide support for the entire product and not pass the buck after asking for a simple re-install of the app.  Re-install is the equivalent of asking someone to restart their computer and then giving up on providing any support beyond that.  Too bad.  I was looking forward to having this in my bedroom.  (It wasn't going in the living room, as planned, since the wood paneling is too 1970s and the size is too large making it horrific centerpiece which must remain 12 inches from any wall or object.)I've had no issue with Belkin WeMo products thus far, I own quite a few, and am extremely disappointed in my first call to their customer service team.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRZQY9VB9IO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL770ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1HRZQY9VB9IO9","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an excess of speakers in our home. Soundbars, bluetooth, docked, wired, etc.  I've known about SONOS for a long time now and, while I always thought they were cool, I didn't see the need for yet another speaker.  Our primary source of music is Spotify which means that bluetooth speakers were our main way of getting music from my iPhone to my ears.  Wire/docked speakers meant I couldn't answer texts, Google recipes, or 1980s actors I couldn't quite remember the name of while I listened to my music.  Bluetooth speakers didn't allow me to wander too far away from the speaker or listen to music throughout my house.  Also, when calls came in or my texts went ""ding"" that was also heard through the speakers.With the SONOS I have perfection.  I can listen to the same song in every room or listen to a song in my room while kids listen to something different (horrific) in the living room.  My whole house and backyard is covered by my WiFi so I can wander anywhere with my iPhone and still hear my music.  I can answer my texts or a phone call without interrupting my jam.  As for the sound, pretty darn good!  I am completely happy with my purchase and plan on purchasing two more to cover the rest of my house.

"Our family really enjoys the Fluxx series of games.  We own Fluxx 4.0, Pirate Fluxx and Fluxx the Board Game so we were happy to try the latest iteration of the Fluxx family.  Fluxx, by itself, is a simple game.  You start out with three cards and on your turn you must draw a card and play a card.  What makes the game wild is that there are cards that change the rules of the game, the goals of the game, and the odds of everyone winning.  The fact that it is never the same game twice makes it re-playable.What I discovered is that Fluxx 4.0 and Fluxx 5.0 are nearly identical with the exception of ""Creeper"" cards.  These are cards, for the most part, that you don't want.  Having them in your possession typically prevents you from winning.  While Fluxx removed these cards in 5.0 to make the game easier for those new to the game, I miss them terribly.  I miss that feeling of impending doom when I picked up a Creeper when I was one turn away from winning the game and wracking my brain trying to figure out how to get rid of it ASAP.I would say the 4.0 version of Fluxx was a 4.5 star game.  The 5.0 version of Fluxx is a 3.5 or 4 star game.  I still love the idea, game play, and portablity of Fluxx and have been eyeballing the Holiday Fluxx (my child has been eyeballing the Cartoon Network Fluxx) for our next Fluxx purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0F4ASFO45KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OETKWCE#wasThisHelpful","R1D0F4ASFO45KU","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A couple years ago I had another brand of personal blender that did not blend nearly as smoothly and died within a few weeks of occasional use.  While this personal blender is not for hot food or anything else other than a smoothie/milkshake, what it does, it does so so well.Pros:- Blends so smoothly and no ""ice chunks"" are left in the smoothie.- The smoothie is made inside the travel cup. I have a big and amazing blender but there are excess dishes to wash when all I want is a smoothie. The Fusion Blade Personal Blender is perfect and, because it is so convenient, I find that I've been making many more healthy smoothies at home (I'm saving money and I'm eating better!).- The On/Off button just needs to be pressed and does not need to be held down which gives you time to put your fruit/milk/etc. away while your smoothie is blending.- Suction cup feet on the blender make it extremely stable on the counter.- Measurements are listed on the side of the container so you can have a consistent smoothie every time.- The cup is leak-proof and the lid snaps closed and open so it doesn't flop around when you are walking or drinking.- There is a place you can hook the travel cup to a carabiner to attach it to your/your child's backpack or gym bag.- Easy clean up.  Just throw in the dishwasher!Cons:- None yet.

"Our family loves card/dice/board games and every year it is a tradition to have at least one Mensa Select game under the Christmas tree.  Why Mensa Select games?  Well, for the most part, they are easy to learn but hard to master.  Our family does not like games that do not require some degree of strategy and intellect to win.  We own the majority of the Mensa Select winners and they are our absolute favorites.  I highly recommend you check out all the present and past winners to fill your family's game closet.As for Gravwell:Design: Beautiful graphics on the box and board.  One star lost for the cheap pawns (spaceships) as one spaceship came off its pedestal during normal game play. Nothing a dot of super glue won't fix but still, it should have held up past a couple minutes of moving around the board.Rules:  They are actually quite simple once you get through the back story and examples of play.  It took me a couple reads to tease out the actual rules.  We played the first game as a practice round.  After that, we did not need to reference the rules again.  Nothing is more of a fun-killer than having to go back to the rules a dozen or more times during a game.Game play: We all enjoyed the simple rules and the difficult mastery.  It is fun to predict what you think your opponent(s) will play and you *must* base your move on what you believe they will do next.Overall, a good game deserving of the Mensa Select award.  Not completely addicting like some in our closet but a game we will surely pull out and add to our rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R364ANR4ZD2RLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617682934#wasThisHelpful","R364ANR4ZD2RLI","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Screen protectors are, in my opinion, a necessity. We own a ton of screens in this house and I learned early on that if the screen isn't protected, it WILL get scratched. I also learned the easiest way to get them on without dust bubbles.  Head into the bathroom with the protector kit and tape, close the door, run a hot shower and let the room get nice and steamy.  Dust can't float around in the thick steamy air.  Apply the protector and work out the bubbles.  If for some reason you see a tiny piece of dust that is creating a bubble, use the tape to lift the corner of the protector and use another piece of tape (not your oily fingers) to remove the speck of dust. I've always been successful with this method.  Sure, it takes a bit of time but saves the frustration of all the infuriating dust bubbles.This screen protector does its job and is a good quality.  It went on easily enough using the method above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDU8WGGHT7A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8JWUWW#wasThisHelpful","RXDU8WGGHT7A9","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had these for months and I keep purchasing more and more.  They are almost the same price as plain ol' LED bulbs but with the added bonus of working with my smart home.  I run everything through the Wink Hub and they have worked flawlessly since day one.Why smart bulbs?You can still use a light switch to turn them off and on (so necessary for day-to-day use) but you will need the light switch in the ""on"" position to control the lights from your smartphone.You can turn the lights off/on or dim them right from your smartphone.You can create shortcuts/scenes (""Reading in Bed"" or ""Watching a Movie"") from your smart phone. One click on your shortcut/scene and you can make various lights brighten, dim, turn off and turn on.You can set your bedroom lights up on a schedule to jar you awake in the morning (it has made getting out of bed so much faster, though slightly more painful, for me).You can set up a geofence so when you leave your house in the morning for work, all the lights in the house go off.You can set up a ""random"" schedule for lights to go on and off throughout the home while on vacation so it appears the house is occupied.I'm sure there are other ways people utilize these bulbs, and I'd love to hear them, but for the above reasons these bulbs are worth much more than $15 a piece to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIRWH8YTOP9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOL16K0#wasThisHelpful","RXIRWH8YTOP9C","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, thick and snug fitting case.  The Kindle Fire snaps in securely and I can't imagine it ever falling out.  Even with me shaking and shaking, it held tight.  There is no need to take the Fire out since the case has access to the charging port and all of the buttons, however, I attempted to take the Fire out of the case and found it extremely difficult.  A great sign that the Fire isn't going to ever go flying out in the future.The fact the case is reversible is ingenious.  You can use the fabric side if you want an interesting design or, if you are storing the case somewhere it could possibly get dirty (ex. beach bag), flip it around and the faux leather side makes it easy to wipe down.With all the pros, the only con is that when put in ""standing"" position, it doesn't hold well enough to stand up to a bump. While sitting on a stable surface, like a desk, it stays up, however, in a car or plane or somewhere else it may get jostled, it may collapse.

"This truly is an amazing pan that reduces clean up by allowing us to eat out of one pan.  I can make a ""fancy"" omelet (goat cheese, feta, sundried tomatoes, onions, Tapatio) in one section for me and, in another section, an omelet with bacon and cheese for the kid.  Before, I would have to get out a few pans to make the same meal.  Since I am unable to eat beef and pork, I would need a separate pan to fry the bacon and cook the meaty omelet.Pros:- The omelet was so much fluffier in this pan with the steam option than I have ever made in a typical pan.- Only one pan to clean for four different ""meals.""  For example, it can make a meat version, a veggie version, a cheesy version and an herb version.  Hate rosemary but your significant other loves it? Super easy.  Same with making a spicy and non spicy version for the adults and kids.  One person allergic to cheese? It keeps it all separate in the same pan.- So fast!

"I love my Rabbit corkscrew.Seriously. I. Love. It.I mean, it makes access to, and opening, wine so easy. What's not to love?I was excited to see how this, relatively inexpensive, preserver held up to my expectations of the ""Rabbit"" name.Overall, I am fairly happy with the results. It keeps my open bottle fresher for a couple extra days and it is fairly simple to use. You do need to put some downward force on the unit when using it to get a decent seal but once you do, you'll start feeling the difference in pressure. My only wish is that I knew when to stop pumping. I don't want to break anything so I take my best guess.... but in the back of my mind I think, ""Just one more to be sure?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHHHMIZJLQ0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTWA3HQ#wasThisHelpful","RHHHHMIZJLQ0Y","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't expecting these to perform as well as they did. I used regular old-fashioned chalk and it wrote beautifully across the surface. Additionally, I placed the sticker on and pulled it off of a plastic tub (the type found on rolling carts with plastic drawers), off a mirror and off a smooth metal tin.

"I was thrilled to get this as the potluck season approaches.  The prepared trays of cheeses/crackers/meats or veggies/dip are always so overpriced and often dried out after being cut and sitting for days waiting for someone to purchase them.  Making my own cheap, easy (last minute!) party platter is great!Sadly, while the outer container (lid and base) are thick enough not to bend much, the inner ""dip"" container arrived crushed.  It is thinner than a container you would find at your local dollar store and since mine arrived crushed, the lid won't screw on.  I have tried manipulating the plastic and was able to get the lid screwed on without dip/sauce inside but I can't/won't do it when there is something inside (I don't want to put my fingers in everyone's dip trying to get a lid on!).For now, I am covering the dip container with press-n-seal wrap and putting the lid on top of the wrap without screwing it on.  I am hoping to find a replacement container that will fit.Even with the internal container causing problems, I still really like the outer so much that I will keep it and probably use it several times a month for all the work parties/potlucks/bonfires I go to.I am already planning my next few platter ideas:- Different varieties of apples with caramel sauce- Veggies and pita chips with hummus- Crusty Bread and crackers with spinach dip- Chips and mini quesadilla triangles with guacamole- Shrimp and cocktail sauce- Crackers and veggies with blue cheese pecan dip- Chicken wings and blue cheese dressing","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8WMRV2W1OG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPT8REO#wasThisHelpful","R1T8WMRV2W1OG6","A1QTHVA826XEOS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QTHVA826XEOS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm so torn on this product.  On one hand, it sinks right into my skin with no greasy or lotion-y after feel.  My powder glides right on top of it without sticking or caking or changing the color or getting too thick.  It has made a difference on my fine lines (I'm still young enough I don't have the biggies yet).  It is in a pump container (no sticking my fingers in a pot!). It is organic to top it all off.So what's the downside?  The price.  It is only 1oz of product (though the huge pump would lead you to believe there is a ton more in there).  If I had a much larger disposable income, I would absolutely use this under my makeup everyday.

Anker has always provided serious quality at amazing prices. Hopefully they keep up the good work and do not hike up prices like many other established companies tend to do (although since they haven't after all this time, I don't see why they  would now).As for this battery, I am replacing the last Anker battery I bought December 5th, 2012 ( I had to look that up and it amazed me that it has been that long).  The only reason I am replacing it is because I dropped my laptop and broke off part of the battery (the little tab that connects it to the laptop, which is apparently crucial).  The battery was still working until I broke it, though obviously not as well as when it was first bought.  Still it did hold a charge for several hours at a time until that fateful day when my laptop went tumbling down, thankfully no crowns or pails of water involved.Basically, I appreciate Anker. Like Amazon, they do not disappoint (so far). #fingers crossed","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y47KXLJW6HLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047XRVWQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y47KXLJW6HLV","AXQNEMI9N0Z2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(a couple of season 5 spoilers included, so please proceed with caution)Great show!  These characters are so complex and layered.  So dynamic.  So substantial.  It is usually hard to tell what they will do and many instances on this show have caught me completely by surprise, which has me hooked.The delicate relationship between Boyd and Raylan has made them my favorite frenemies on television or film by far.  Olyphant's character (Raylan Givens) walks a fine line between good and bad (and sometimes even stumbles over it) and usually I want him to succeed except for the few occasions I actually want him to fail.  Usually when it comes to Boyd.  Oddly enough, I almost always want Boyd to win anything he does.  Such a deeply conflicted character.  He has certain honorable ideals, and yet he has his ALWAYS criminal lifestyle.  And Boyd has come such a long way from the season one old distant almost friend coworker to Raylan, less than loyal brother, and ""all around bad guy who robbed banks and was just rather second rate"" to a criminal 'almost' kingpin who is deeply devoted to his longtime girlfriend (and now ex) and even pretty loyal to his frenemy and knows how to handle himself in just about any situation.The characters have alliances and friendships that may change based on the situation.  Even Raylan is far from the man he was in season 1.  Back then it was all about the law, with a few caveats when it came to his home town and its occupants.  Now he is looking to the future and his career and his ability to care for his family.  Which actually makes him less likeable in some way, though not enough to make him unlikeable.  The man is still amazing.As for supporting characters, I cannot believe how incredible the supporting cast is from year to year.  And not just the regular characters but the one-season ones as well.  Time and again I have been shocked by the calibur of actor that has been killed off after first appearing, reminiscent of that first scene in Scream where one of the title characters just up and dies on us.  Seasonally, really great actors and characters have appeared and 'exited' all while my jaw brushes the ground.  All of it clearly well thought out by the writers.  And the ones that stick around are pretty amazing as well.  High quality, great acting.Speaking of which, this group of writers is so on point.  Their dialogue is perfect.  It is realistic while also being incredibly dark and sardonic, sometimes funny, sarcastic, curt, ridiculous (when appropriate for the character), and always reflective of the individual speaking.  The storyline is gripping and both engaging and repellent (in the 'I am glad I am not there but I just can't stop watching' sort of way).All in all, one of the best shows ever created and continues to be great even now.  I now there is one season left but my heart wants more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLJNNLKLDQ2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7NDSPC#wasThisHelpful","R1YLJNNLKLDQ2M","AXQNEMI9N0Z2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This ribbon is beautiful and will add some depth and substance to any craft work.  I love the natural color and consistency of this muslin.  The edges will continue to fray with wear so adding some sort of adhesive to sections will help, especially in places that will not be visible.  For my needs, this ribbon works well in art projects such as scrapbook pages, handmade frames, and home decor.  I think it might be a bit too wide for use in cardmaking.  It is 9.8 feet long (3 meters) and about 2 inches wide if you are including the frayed edges and 1 3/4 inches wide if only counting the center without the fray.  I love that the spool is solid wood (feels substantial) and it comes with a pearl tipped pin.

"Works well but does get dirty pretty fast for me.  I love the feel and the superhero/comic book theme.  I just wish the colors were a bit more adult, subtle, muted.

"Disclaimer: There are no babies in our home.These are the best wipes ever.  They are gentle.  They are not scented.  They are durable.  I use them not just in every bathroom but also in my bedroom for any craft projects I work on and I always keep a pack in the car.  Those are the ones that get used most often.  Seriously, I can't imagine not having them in the car.I have tried other wipes and wetnaps.  I have even tried feminine wipes.  Nothing compares to these.  The wipes are so strong and durable you can reuse the same one over and over again just by rinsing it, which I have done many times when using them to clean off acrylic stamps.The odors that come along with other wipes really turn me off.  They can be so strong and perfume-y.  Ugh.  These don't have that issue at all.  They are slightly scented, I assume just from the ingredients.  No scent has been added at all and you can barely tell they even have a scent.  Basically you have to put them up to your nose to smell anything.  These aren't tissue, so really how often will that ever happen?These new packs also have free travel packs included so you can keep a pack in your purse for emergencies or in case you have to use a public restroom.  Believe me, you would rather have these and have to lug them around in case of an emergency than get stuck in a public restroom with no bathroom tissue.

"These boots are wonderful.  They did hurt the first time I wore them but after breaking them in I have had no issues.  They are waterproof and hold terrain very well.  They also match pretty much any outfit.  I have used them on boulders and large rocks that are up to roughly 60 degree angles and terrain steeper than that and they have not let me down yet.  I have enjoyed using them on numerous hikes and they have so far kept me safe and dry.  Fingers crossed this continues.I am in Southern California and consider these my 'winter' hiking boots.

"These hiking boots were so much more comfortable the first time I wore then than the Columbia boots I bought (also on Amazon - Columbia Women's Newton Ridge Plus Hiking Boot) roughly at the same time.  I wore these for the first time for a 5 mile hike in Long Beach and they were great.  My feet felt great.  The hike felt relatively easy.  I was in heaven.After the second time I wore these shoes, the little cloth tab the holds the laces near the top of the boot broke open and released my laces.  Somehow, that does not fill me with confidence on the life of these boots.  Meanwhile, the Columbia boots are wonderful.  Had to break them in.  They kinda hurt the first time I wore them but after that they were great.  They are high quality and satisfying.I am kinda torn now.  I love the comfort but how do I give a great review to a pair of hiking boots that lasted all of one hike.  I mean I can still wear them and sometimes do, but I do have to forego that top level of lacing.

"Update 8/26/2015:These socks are my favorites.  They stay in place, never slide down.  They are soft and cozy, but not too thick (great for California weather).  I use them when I go hiking, and I have never been disappointed.  The waffle weave and actually very comfy.  I need to buy more of these.  I do have to say, I usually prefer ankle socks.  I used to hate anything higher than ankle length, because I felt the socks always either fit too tight or slid down too easily.  These do neither.  I don't end up with marks on my skin from where they would strangle my legs like other crew socks.  And I don't have to worry about them either sliding down my leg or sliding into my shoes.  After two hours hiking in Eaton Canyon, they are still where I placed them and my feet feel great.  That is probably why these are my favorites.Original Review:We have been an organic eating household for a few years now and have recently started transitioning to more organic 'wear' as well. I was hesitant to buy these as I thought they might not feel good considering the waffle knit pattern and how much I am used to wearing 'smooth' material socks, but these socks feel great.From what I have learned, PACT is an ethical and organic company.  It is also a Fair Trade company, as well as qualifying for many other ethical and ecological high quality standards.I have recently learned that being organic is not only good for your body, it is good for the workers who process the ingredients put into these items.  For too long workers picking non-organic ingredients have been exposed to inhumane toxic substances while they are harvesting these very ingredients.  They actually get sprayed with pesticides and other products while in the fields!  By choosing organic, we can help make sure the standard of living for these workers improves, as well as our own health and well-being.

"My hummingbirds love this.

"Despite being labeled Italian Herb breadcrumbs, these breadcrumbs have little flavor.  However, being that we have gone organic and these are the only ones I can find, I absolutely appreciate that they exist.  To give them more traditional Italian breadcrumb taste I just add a LOT of Italian blend organic dried herbs to the mix when I am preparing anything, sometimes more and sometimes less depending on what I happen to be making at the time.  I also find this mix to be a little lumpier/clumpier than the kind I used to buy, so I will sometimes run these through the food processor or put them through my mortar & pestle to give them the right consistency.Some options for uses:Fried anything (chicken, shrimp, fish, veggies)Milanese (beef, chicken...)Baked breaded anything (chicken, veggies, fish...)Casserole topping for just about any casseroleMac and cheese toppingMeatloafMeatballs (turkey, beef, pork...)Toppings for just about anything bakedGeez, not the healthiest list but so many more options out there and now I am a little hungry so good luck!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S4WPG8SH5WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4EUNE#wasThisHelpful","R17S4WPG8SH5WY","AXQNEMI9N0Z2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter is an avid archer and when putting together a bulletin board for her room, this seemed the obvious choice.  However her favorite color is pink so I was disappointed these did not come in more colors.  Instead, a little pink acrylic paint and tiny paintbrush later and they are absolutely perfect.  She didn't even know I painted them.  After painting a target on her cork board in the same color, it was the perfect addition.As for the actual product, I had no trouble handling them and she has used them multiple times and they are holding up well.  I know another reviewer mentioned they broke, so I was a little worried.  I don't know if painting them made them more sturdy/durable but so far so good and she could not be happier.They are small, cute, and they look so good on the board.  The points are pretty sharp and pierce well.

It is also easy to clean but you have to be gentle and careful.  Beware if you are clumsy.

"I recently made my daughter a bulletin board for her room.  She is a huge Sherlock fan so I used fabric in the pattern of the sherlock wallpaper (in the famous scene where he shoots at the wall) and then hand painted the yellow smilie to scale.  Then I embellished it with famous sherlock quotes and some antique-y looking british-y embellishments and used these clever bullet pushpins to put up all the quotes and even put a few on the smilie.  She absolutely loved it and adored the pushpins.  The whole project made her cry with happiness, not to mention posting on social media.  These pushpins really put it over the top.

"When I bought this originally it was 4 sheets of grape.  I loved it.  I used my Cricut to cut out a fancy shape in different sizes and put them on all of my pantry clear glass containers to label everything and make everything look cohesive despite being different sizes and shapes.  Thanks to these labels, everything looks amazing and as if it were a single set of containers.I only have two complaints.1. The sheets were shipped in a container that did not fit the 12"" length and so the sheets were folded in half.  This ruined some of the paper.2. The color I originally ordered was grape and now that I need more there is no grape available in this 4 sheet pack.  However, this same company has grape in a two sheet of the same size for the same price as the 4 sheet.  Basically, I now have to pay double for the same amount.  From reading the reviews on the 2 sheet pack they are still shipped in too small a package for the length of the paper and are either rolled or folded in half.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZURVGFM9T6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CJA1AC#wasThisHelpful","R2PZURVGFM9T6W","AXQNEMI9N0Z2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Infusium leaves our hair feeling so healthy and is a great alternative to gel or mousse.  Since it is a leave in conditioner, it actually helps maintain the health of our hair while it helps style it.  After a shower, when our hair is still wet, we put a little of this into our hair before we brush it.  Then we just let our hair naturally dry (but I think you can blow dry it too if you prefer) with a clip holding it together.  When our hair is totally dry, drop the clip and it looks like you just stepped out of a salon.  Smells wonderful, too.  Amazing stuff and your health stays SO healthy, shiny, beautiful.  And this is from someone who washes her hair pretty much every day.One caution...if you put enough and you try to brush your hair later when it is dry, it will flake.  However, I think the same happens with other hair products so that should be a given.

"This carousel is plastic and lightweight.  It is not made of marble or any other nice looking material.  However, I didn't buy it for the looks.  I bought it for the function and BOY does it ever function!  I am a crafter and have had to constantly open and close drawers and compartments to reach the most often used supplies.  With this item I imagined things would get a little easier.  I had no idea how much I was missing this item until I finally bought it.  Things run so smoothly now.  Anything I can't reach I just have to spin and get.  The only items I still keep separate are my glue dots and foam tapes.  The only thing I would change about this item is to make the center a complete cup-like section instead of separated into four pie sections as it is now.  That would make this absolutely perfect.  Still, it has helped so much and been such a time saver that I still rank it at 5 stars.Despite the light weight and construction, this item does hold pretty much everything I use often and doesn't have any chance of tipping over.  The base is so wide (10.5 inches) that when loaded with all of my supplies, it's very sturdy and stable and still spins easily.  I added two images that show this carousel loaded up with crafting tools and items while it is sitting on a mat that is labeled in inches.I still can't believe how much easier things are with this item.

"We live in an area with hard water, not as hard as when I was a kid where you could leave a glass of water out and it'd turn brown from iron in an hour, but enough that it will build up in the coffee pot.  So we've been using pitchers like this for drinking for a few years.  We've been using Brita simply because the local warehouse store stocks their filters primarily and it's cheaper.It's a bit smaller than our Brita, which is slightly annoying since you have to fill it up more often. On the other hand, it takes less room in the smaller fridge in the bedroom easily.  Speaking of taste, the water is quite good.  I found it better than our tap and on par with bottled water we drink.  Of course, I pretty much find all bottled water to taste the same, so if you're particularly sensitive to a brand I'm sure you'll readily notice a difference.  The pitcher fills up quickly enough, slower than you'd probably expect if you've never used one of these, in which case don't expect to put in water and stand there waiting to fill your glass up.  You'll want to let it do its thing and chill in the refrigrator for at least 15-20 minutes ahead of time.The LED is kind of useless since it doesn't measure the water that goes through it.  It's only a timing indicator for how long they think it will run through that much water.  Our Brita has that too, though not as nice a one, and I've had water bottles that had it.  I find the best option is to just keep track on the fridge how many time you filled it or failing that, stick a piece of tape on the outside to say when you changed the filter.  The companies that make these have every incentive to be extremely conservative on how long a filter lasts so you'll buy more.  That said, if you do fill these very rarely they will ""go bad"" over time too.  A filter's usefulness is a factor of both time and throughput.No real complaints about the pitcher. The lid could be a little more durable, but isn't anything I'm too terribly worried about.  When measured against our old Brita, we'll probably keep using that as our primary simply due to filters being readily available in store near us and our already having a membership to that place.  If they switched to stocking PUR filters, then we'd switch to PUR.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382XHPBHC3GKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FQ8QHO#wasThisHelpful","R382XHPBHC3GKB","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two different attachments so it can be used as a full grill, full griddle, half grill/half griddle or panini maker.  We've been using it primarily for turkey panini sandwiches and grilled cheese.  The grill works fast and my wife reminded me twice to make sure I mention how easy it was for her to clean.  It's absolutely the most convenient way we've found to make sandwiches with sliced French bread or longer slices of sourdough because it's longer and doesn't fit well in a toaster and the toaster oven takes longer.There were a few little things about it that we didn't like.  The way it opens on the top, my wife pinched her hand pretty well in it.  Nothing serious, just enough to hear a yelp from the other room.  Having the control knobs on the front makes it take more space than it needs to on the counter and also make it easier to get grease in and harder to clean.  The most important thing though was the release for the top removable grill part.  The release lever jammed after only a couple of uses and she had to work at it for about ten minutes to get it out.  I then spent some time shoving it really hard into the top, ejecting it, and repeating until it seems to have worked out the kinks now.  If you have a similar issue, the release thing triggers a small moving metal piece roughly in the middle/front of the top.  You can sort of work it unstuck a little bit.It is heavy, which is a blessing and a curse.  My guess, it'll be a lot more durable than some cheaper brands, but it is a little more of a hassle to move around; it's not a major problem though.

"Here's my main qualification, and why I can't rate higher; it's loud.  Not loud across the room, but more hear it within a few feet when bending over to plug something in.  It's a weird almost hissing/crackling sound that I've never heard before.  I know some electronics make sound, but this is the first protector I've ever had this happen with and it has me freaked out.  Maybe it's normal for the device?  Maybe it's a defective one?  I don't know.  No reviews currently mention any annoying sounds.  If anybody knows, please advise.Aside from that, I like the design better than the last protector I got.  It is very attractive, the plugs are spaced well to allow for different shaped cords, and the USB ports are the icing on the cake.  Both ports together output up to 4.8 Amps which will charge even two tablets pretty quickly.  The screw that holds it into the outlet makes it harder to install, needing at least a Phillips screwdriver and in my case a flathead one too, but also means it won't pop out of the wall when you're unplugging something else.  I was happy to see it wasn't drawing extra power, even with a USB cable in, until the phone/tablet was plugged in, so no wasted power usage leaving just the cord plugged in.  The two indicator lights are directly on the front and a little bright, so might be irritating if used in the bedroom.  Pretty good all around form and function.Electrical ratings are: 15A, 125V, 60Hz, 1875WUSB Output: Combined 4.8 AmpsSurge Rating: 900 JoulesResponse Time: < 1 NanosecondMax Spike Current: 30,000AUL Clamping Voltage: 500V (UL 1449 3rd. Ed.)EMI/RFI Noise Filter: 150kHz - 100Mhz up to 40 DbThe manual is actually amusing to read for a change.  Below are a few quotes.-""Please follow these cautionary statements.  If you don't, your Studio4.8 might break, your warranty will be void, and you will be very unhappy with yourself""-""If you're feeling all handy and want to alter or repair your Studio4.8...Don't""-""...We know you're tough, but take'er easy on the mounting screw.  Over tightening = sadness...""Normal caveat I have to say for any surge protector.  I'd always suggest paying for a UPS (backup battery) for a computer system or anything really sensitive.  These MOV units are simple devices with a finite lifespan.  When the internals on these have taken the Joule rating it's got, 900 in this case, it's dead.  That can be one big spike or a lot of little ones over a long period.  Also, don't expect to collect on the $100K advertised protection.  Per their included booklet, it covers only what isn't covered by your home owner's insurance, even if you can prove everything and file a claim in time.  It's hard to mark down for that though, almost literally all cheaper protectors make those claims.  Best to figure you'll never see a cent from any of them and maybe be pleasantly surprised.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4ZACW95AZH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKSX0Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1B4ZACW95AZH9","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had some bad luck with my Dell XPS 8700 and I mean bad.  It's on its third motherboard, second hard drive, and 2nd PSU.  After the second motherboard died, I started suspecting the Dell PSU so I tried this as a cheap and well speced PSU to replace it.  I've LOVED my EVGA graphics cards and their customer service was top notch so what the heck.Well, first one came and there was a sort of ticking, but not quite ticking, sound.  Sort of an oscillating sound.  After a few hours research and watching videos on Youtube, I tracked it down to a likely bearing issue.  Not good for a 2 day old supply.  Amazon was AWESOME and took care of the shipping label and sent me a new one.  So far at least, no sound at all from the new one, though it had another minor issue.  The first fit very easily in my case.  This one took several minutes of almost forcing in and even after it clicked in place as it should, the screw hole on one side is slightly off.  It still screws in, so it works, but definitely not quite right.Time will tell, but thus far I'm not overly impressed with the quality control so I have some worry it will die prematurely.  As to actual operation, it seems good enough.  No issues yet with my system the past few hours and it feels heavy and solid.  The cords are plentiful and sleeved, but almost too long.  Good to have ones for the video card and a couple of the motherboard ones that power the CPU, but I found it hard to find places for all of them.  Maybe next time I'll go moduler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNHR6CRMA0UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H33SFJU#wasThisHelpful","RPNHR6CRMA0UO","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the first Magicka game on PC.  It was a surprise hit that blew me away with its humor and the things it nailed just like I always wanted to do as a kid, namely the way it does shields.  Though I like the rest as well.Android games tend to be massively inferior to even the old Gameboy Advance games of ages ago due simply to the fact the controls stink.  You can't have a precision game where you can't feel a real button since you're looking down at the keys so much.  It means you either have to have almost turn based style, along the lines of Plants vs. Zombies or Angry Birds, or you have to make the enemies react slower so there's time for the player to find buttons.  Magicka does the latter.  It's a pretty easy game that's still fun and humorous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKB65GUVI2MD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105UQR24#wasThisHelpful","RKB65GUVI2MD3","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is Asian and we tend to eat a lot of rice with our meals.  The first thing she was interested in after we opened the box was the pot part.  I think maybe it's cultural, but she swears that a thicker pot makes the rice taste better.  She was delighted by the thickness of this one and wanted to make sure it was the first thing I listed.  I don't know if it's the pot or the settings, but the rice turned out great.The construction is solid and the buttons sealed so they won't get any water or gunk in them.  The design is attractive and we both liked the color.  The box it came in was gigantic and I was worried at first glance, until I opened it and took the cooker out and found it was only a little larger than our old rice cooker.  Despite being a little bigger than desired, it does make up for it by taking the place of a crock pot and rice cooker.  I mentioned that we'd got a new one and showed a lady at work.  She just looked at it on Amazon and is talking about buying one herself.The primary use for this one will be a rice cooker, but it's also getting a fair amount of use for pot roast.  It was also good for steaming those buns with the red bean paste in them.  It's been good that it's simple to operate from the black and white instruction sheet so we could get up and running without too much effort.  The 70 something full color cookbook included has a lot of simple looking recipes we're going to try out after we deal with a recent death in the family.The only thing that was a little frustrating was trying to figure out the buttons on the front without the little guide.  I got frustrated that I couldn't get it to go to the right time I wanted, but it turned out to be my own fault for hitting the preset button instead of the one I wanted.  She also thought it wasn't doing anything because we couldn't tell immediately if it had started heating or not.  So basically, after trying it out briefly and actually reading the instructions, no problems getting it to work as expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4841TUB6WPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R1I4841TUB6WPO","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, never do their automatic renewal if you get it.  I've head horror stories about their payment partner and you'll nearly always get a worse deal.  Heck, today they have a 6 month free offer if you look on the SlickDeals website.  If you buy via Amazon or another seller you're better off.  I've never had a problem with billing doing it that way and while rebates were really slow they haven't cheated me out of one yet.One thing I do like about Bitdefender is they give you the option to upgrade to the latest version if you still have a valid key.  So you can now get the 2016 version by buying the last version and save some money.  To the reviewer who got the bad copy of the disk, you can use your code and activate a download a copy from their site.So, for the actual 2015 (and 2016 so far) performance here are the pros and cons.Pro:-Detection is great.-Very good at detecting and removing stuff.-Rated among the highest.-Cheap if you can find it on sale.Con:-Can drag an older system to the ground.-Can drag a newer system to the ground, be prepared to do repair installs every few months.-Slightly weird interface makes it hard to find things.-Web based tool doesn't remotely reflect reality of the machines it's supposedly monitoring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJH4K1TMNWWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM6SMWQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JJH4K1TMNWWX","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are thicker than the ones we had before and not that much higher priced.  It's stupid and irrelevant, but the fake metal box just looks pretty cool sitting in the closet.  I use fairly often for things like cleaning the gutters so we don't have a hanging garden like the neighbors and past ones shredded pretty quickly, but to be fair aren't called heavy duty.  These held out quite a bit longer to scraping against the tiles on the roof so I'm moderately impressed.  My tactile sensitivity wearing them is slightly less, but that would be due to being slightly thicker.They're powder free so if you're borderline sensitive maybe it helps.  I don't have even a mild latex allergy so really don't consider it much.  I got the medium size and it fits well, except the fingers have a little bit more length to them so I kind of look like the wicked witch of the west.

"I'm not certain the height range this is for, but it seems better for slightly below average.  The wife and I are 5'5"" and 5'6"" and didn't find it uncomfortable, but the resting sitting position due to the lumbar support is sort of a head lying back rested on the back that's not really a position you'd do work in.  I feel kind of like a king holding court from his thrown.  The arm rests dig into my arms after a while.  For home use in front of the computer it's not an issue.  For 8 hours a day at work, I can't see it being very comfortable.I have no real problems with the cheap fake leather stuff used to cover it. Actual leather chairs will tend to crack and break eventually.  A friend of mine had one where the arm cracks were scraping up his arm.  Synthetic shouldn't have that problem, but also don't look or feel as good.  If I'm wearing shorts and it's hot/humid then I stick to it when getting up.  It's got quite a bit of chrome, so plan on wiping finger prints.  Adjustments are limited to up/down and tilt tension control.  Base is wide enough to be stable, but is a little larger than your average door so we had  to twist a little bit getting into a door.  Really wish I'd built it in the room it will reside, but not a major hassle.The box size is reasonably compact and packed well.  Given there was a giant whole torn in the package from what appears to be bad shippers, I was initially worried, but everything survived intact.  Getting the parts out was easy and things were better protected than I'd expected with lots of protective wrapping.  The instructions are cartoons, probably so they don't have to pay for translations, and go from a couple basic steps, to figure out how the heck we did stuff in between these to steps, to fully finished chair.Assembly was the worst I've had to do with a chair.  You need a Phillips or flat head screwdriver and an included Allen wrench to do it.  Plan on it taking at least half an hour, and unless you're a skilled contortionist, two people.  The top part is pretty easy, until you get to attaching the back to the bottom.  The wholes are nearly impossible to line up without someone pushing down hard on the seat while you try to line them up.  Afterwards, the screws don't want to go in evenly at all.  I had one that hung out and I had to just brute force to turn the screw, eventually pretty much stripping it to the point it'll never be usable again, but so it's lined up with the others and should be safe.Minor thing, but there's also an obnoxious orange label that shows what you're not supposed to do in the chair.  Let's just say if you have a teenager, or a dirty mind, one of the images will certainly be a source of a few laughs you won't want.  Only way to get rid of it is to cut it off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KH5MBHMDH892/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4NAHWA#wasThisHelpful","R3KH5MBHMDH892","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really liked the idea of the paper because it's thin so you can put more in the paper tray, have it take less room in a folder, and it doesn't hurt that it's on the nicer side of ecological concerns where printer paper is concerned.  I found it to be really good as far as thin paper goes.  Basically, it's something I would use for printing off coupons for restaurants, our yearly tax returns, etc. where looking pretty has little effect.  I would absolutely NEVER use for something that would go out to customers, be posted anywhere, or for a resume.  The paper is thin, almost transparently thin, and doesn't feel substantial when I hold it.  It's also not great for double-sided printing because the letters show through.All this didn't bother me, I knew that going in.  The problem I had is that after printing a 3rd sheet of paper with it, my Brother MFC-J430W started having spasms.  The paper loaded fine, but I got the first ever software error message it could not complete a page print.  I tried again, it spent several minutes thinking to itself, then printed out most of a page.  Then it wouldn't even print for probably 10 minutes and I had to reboot.  It printed, but made awful whinging noises inside.  I took out the paper, ruffled it up a bit, and put the tray back.  The next sheet took longer to print that usual, but did come out alright.  The one after that worked fine as well.  I've had the printer maybe 1.5 years and never had a paper feed issue in that time.  My first 10 pages using this paper took me well over 30 minutes to finally get out.So anyway, I'll hopefully be able to use the rest of this paper, because it really is exactly what I needed in terms of use of space, but if the printer keeps having problems I'll have to give up and go back to the thicker stuff.---Update 06/22/15---I've raised it up to four stars now.  After fanning the paper really well and replacing it I've been printing with no further jams so far.  Still not entirely confident there won't be more given the initial experience, but I'm now cautiously optimistic.  I'll update my review if it does start jamming regularly again.  I'm starting to sense the cheaper the printer the more likely this paper is to not work properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212JRLNFE19RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL06L6C#wasThisHelpful","R212JRLNFE19RD","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been buying Worms games that are basically the same for probably 15 years now.  I even have Worms World Party for the GBA!  No, I'm not complaining...well, other than Worms World Party for GBA was literally completable due to massive bugs.  It's nice to still be able to play such a timeless classic and they keep refining and adding little things, though often break some of the good things.So, since there are a lot of reviews I'll keep this short.  The good is classic Worms like you've probably played many times in the past.  Ninja ropes actually function so that's a plus.  The bad, the thing is fairly glitchy and will crash semi-regularly.  It also has log in problems with its DRM which may make it unplayable for you for a short time or permanently.  Getting it to give you an option to go to your home screen is often an exercise in frustration where you have to swipe many times before anything recognizes.  So yeah, it's Worms on Android and it's good for that, but it's still got a lot of problems that mar it.  Bitdefender's Cueful program recognizes it as a moderate privacy risk as well, so they may very well be collecting data to sell to supplement a game that's already pricier than many.

"Come on guys, this thing is priced relatively close to what you can get the full 22 episode seasons for and you only have one DVD and no special features?!?  Wtf?  It's a cynical money grab since they know if you bought the earlier seasons you'll want to complete the set.  Not cool.That said, my star rating reflects the DVD set, not the quality of the show.  The fourth season was on par with Season 3.  I watched them when it originally aired and missed one, so I'm looking forward to getting up to that again.  I'm currently on disc 2 of Season 3 and binge watching so I'll be up to Season 4 soon.  Anyway, it's a wrap up because the network was good enough to not just leave the show hanging after season 3.  The main gist is the final shutdown of Division and the Shop trying to get Nikita to go away.  You also have the final ""battle"" with Amanda that wraps up that arc well, though it wasn't quite the ending I'd have chosen.If you can get over a completely implausible series where the highly trained bad guys are taken down two and three at a time by the main characters then you'll enjoy Nikita.  I'd highly recommend getting the first three seasons and starting from there.  This was a good one to finish out my set, but I think at minimum they should have had a second DVD with special features for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GI6J1NJ56828/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H57HOSC#wasThisHelpful","R2GI6J1NJ56828","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seasons 1 and 2 of Nikita were some really awesome TV.  I'd liked the old La Feme Nikita alright, only saw season 2 and 3 I bought on sale, but in my opinion the remake is a lot more plausible, even if it's still a thoroughly implausible show.  What I mean is that so many people are double, super secret, triple agents with secret pasts, it really run similar to that old 90's Spider man cartoon where basically everybody he knows ends up as a super hero or villain by the end.  Heck, they have to fill episodes and it's enjoyable if you don't question things too deeply so who cares?Anyway, season 2 has some really good arcs and I loved Percy's return from caged animal to something else by the end.  He was my favorite character in the entire show because he was just so dedicated and not exactly evil, but ruthless in getting what he wanted.  The bits where they made him physically impressive were a bit much for me, sort of like the old Stargate SG1 where Carter was not only a scientist, but a perfect shot, a decent cook, and always attractively made up.  People tend to have a flaw or two, which is why the scientist guy from Stargate Atlantis was better IMHO, because he was brilliant, but a neurotic wreck who wasn't that great in combat.  One of the signture bits of Percy's whole presence in the series is the last episode where he gets out of a situation and I don't want to give away any spoilers, so the part in that episode where he does something highly objectionable because he was in a rush.  I won't give away whether he sneaks away, ends up dumped in a deep dank hole to rot, or meets an untimely end, but this was the last season he appeared in and so this was the season I feel the show peaked.In short, get the first season and get this one and you'll not be disappointed.  The third and final season (a paltry 6 episode wrap up) change the dynamic of the series for better or worse, worse in my opinion but tastes vary, though still I'd consider them worth picking up to complete the set.  Just be ready to binge watch because if you miss episodes you'll quickly become lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BJ3K5A2U01V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YG9HJE#wasThisHelpful","R1BJ3K5A2U01V2","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got a bunch of memory cards for our new video camera a few months ago.  I'd been keeping them in the camera case as best I could, but the micro SD cards are tiny and rattled around a lot and so figuring out which one was empty fast became problematic as I moved from only having a couple to having 5 of them.  So this grip box looked like a really interesting way to go.First, I really think it felt like the device as a whole was good quality and sturdy.  I don't think dropping it would break it and the closing mechanism was very sturdy and the drawer was secure and didn't come out even when it was rattling around in my pocket.  The size was small and convenient, maybe twice as wide and half as fat as a lighter.  The orange color makes it handy for me to find visually against the black of my camera, case, and luggage, so that's been convenient.Unfortunately, this seems more like a first draft of a product than a finished one.  The drawer liner was not quite centered so it had an annoying sort of dip to it.  The profile was too low to fit all my SD cards, but no problems with the micro SD.  However, while you can fit a bunch in there, there's no divider or anything that tells you which card is which.  So unless each one is a different size or brand, it's still pretty hard to remember which ones are full and which are empty.  If they'd sort of marked it off with a grid even that'd help a lot when it comes to labeling it.  Which is another problem, the labeling is on the underside of the drawer so to write on it you either have to balance or take all out and then write on it.  You have five boxes you can write in.  Reading can be done without removing the cards, but it's awkward.  These things would be more forgivable if it were maybe 3/4 of the current price.  As is, my personal feeling is it's not a rip off, but is still a bit expensive for what you get.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28A95QDB2G0S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZU0344#wasThisHelpful","R28A95QDB2G0S5","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had much time to read things lately so it's been hard to find a book to pick up. This one caught my eye because it was a cartoonists take on an topic I'm interested in.  I absolutely agree with the author the medium of radio is far from dead.  For one thing, so long as we are driving our own cars or need background noise at work, something we can listen to will be needed.  Whether it stays as traditional radio or goes entirely to streaming or podcasts, who knows, but there will always be room for good story telling.Since it's a ""comic book"" I should probably mention that first.  I was expecting something more of a graphic novel.  This is not to be derogatory, but it's really closer to well drawn newspaper comics instead of a more comic book feel.  Not to say that all are simplistic, but there are a fair number of panes which are very similar to the former one, just with different dialog.  Everything is in black and white, which is OK, but a little color might have been a nice.  I really hate to sound like I'm comparing the two for content or level of detail in the drawings, but for example the old Dilbert books which were collections of comics benefited from the color Sunday strips were nice for the visual break for the pallet.  The font was pretty good sized, but the font they choose and how sometimes text bubbles were squeezed together made it a little tiring to try to read with any speed sometimes.The author focuses a lot on NPR, which has a number of story telling programs, but is hardly the only one.  I've heard multiple talk radio shows out there of a variety of political ideologies be very compelling.  Sometimes on a topic as unpolitical as a TV news guy who lost three jobs in seven years for stalking a coworker, fighting the driver of a UN delegate over a parking space, and then a coworker in the parking lot of a Hooters.  Still, it's probably for the best she didn't focus on the political shows though.  Nowadays, people seem so ready to jump on anyone who thinks differently than they do, without questioning if the other person has a valid point or not.  Anyway though, the breakdown of the various things you should do as a good story teller was handled quite well in my opinion.The general feel of the book is a build up to how you would build a good story.  One of my favorite parts was the one on editing, where a lot of stories really, really fall short.  The old adage of less is more really holds a lot of the time.  From personal experience writing papers it's often the hardest to cut something that I really like, but just doesn't fit well into the overall project.  So that made me feel a little closer to that section of the book.  I also liked the times where multiple points of view were given, for example when they had two different opinions on whether you should reflect at the end of the story or not.  So all in all an enjoyable read and a nice look behind the curtains of Ira Glass' show.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAB5NIATUU2A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348436#wasThisHelpful","RAB5NIATUU2A0","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's almost impossible to write a song review for someone else, so listen to the preview.  It covers the catchy part of the chorus pretty well.  Great song, there are a few bits I'd change if I were all powerful, but good enough I probably listened to it 10-15 times in a row after downloading it because I enjoyed it so much.  Might want to check out the video.  It's sort of a running from black eyed zombies or something, not quite explained, but creepy.

"I found this one better than the old La Fem Nikita.  It's a little more plausible than the old one where the agents were killed fairly frequently.  Basically, it's a spy who got out, got a double agent inside, and then works to bring them down.  It's out there and not really very plausible, but it's a lot of fun.

"If you've not seen a Chromebook before THIS IS NOT A WINDOWS LAPTOP.  Don't expect to run all the software you run on your PC.  Boiled down to the most basic level, it's a web browser in a netbook's body.  If you're looking for a simple buy/don't buy decision, then buy this as it's great, it's cheap, and the annoyances are not deal breakers.  Longer answer, ask yourself, what do you care about?  If you have to have Windows software programs and can't find a work around, this is a pass.  Otherwise, if you can get by with Google Docs and this preferably won't be your main PC at home then it's a good option.  You need a ""real"" computer running the Chrome browser to be able to print documents.  If I miss anything you're wondering about post in the comments and I'll try to answer back quickly.This is my second Chromebook. The first is an aging, but still very speedy Acer C720, so don't worry Chromebooks hold up pretty well in the speed department.  My suggestion, it's worth it for the extra RAM to keep it useful longer.  Anyway, this one is cheaper and smaller than the C720.  The design is much less clunky and the sleek blue is smooth and attractive.  It's also got an astounding 1.5x the battery life!  Assuming you aren't doing a lot of video watching and are just using it for web surfing mostly, you should pass 10 hours on a charge.  I used it all week in the evenings on its first charge.  The keyboard is better in my opinion and feels less spongy and more like a regular PC/Mac/Laptop one.  It'll take some getting used to the keys if you haven't used a Chromebook before, like a search button in place of the caps lock key, but it works.  Touchpad is near perfect and you can easily scroll up and down using two fingers or move the mouse pointer using a single digit.The other nice thing with the Chromebook is the solid state hard drive.  Short version, no moving parts so it boots up in seconds and can't be hurt by jostling or bumping it.  The downside is it's tiny and you only have about 9.5 GB free after space taken by the OS.  I found it easy to set up with a google voice phone number and do video chat with my parents for free.  The camera isn't super powerful, but the picture was good enough for that and it has a little light built in that helps.  There's no need for an antivirus so you literally just turn it on and go.  The OS will update itself without telling you, which is not unique to this one, but may make your performance really bad when it does.  You can find out more details about your system by entering the following command in the web browser URL bar (or downloading an app from the Chromestore).  chrome://system/I do have a few concerns about the design choices.  It may have been done to keep size down, but I am not a fan of the micro HDMI connector.  It requires having either an adapter or a less common cable to show your video on the TV when visiting relatives.  It's purely personal preference, but I would also rather have seen a SD card slot than a micro SD, just so I could have the option of using a microSD with an adapter or use old SD cards I had around.  The device lacks USB 3.0 slots which is not critical since the hard drive is so small, but it definitely drags down file transfers when I copy files I downloaded while at the Starbucks.  Even having just one of them as a 3.0 would have been nice.  The real annoyance is that they are both next to each other and on the same side.  The C720 put them on opposite sides so if you have a fat USB drive it won't block the other one.  I had to buy a different USB drive to fit my mouse in at the same time.  Also, be aware because the thing is so slim, you also have a practical vertical limitation to how fat a connector is, so one of those novelty ones that looks like Bugs Bunny is not going to fit comfortably.  Can hardly blame it for that though.  No problems running video or music off USB flash drives.  I've included formats it can read at the bottom of my review.Last, to expand on what I said at the start, you can't run Windows programs, but you can go to the Chromestore and get many that are compatible for free to do document editing.  You can even use it to control your PC remotely, though after a recent update Chrome Remote Desktop seems to be slightly unreliable for connections at the moment.  To sum it all up, if you want one of these as your main PC, you'll have some limits.  I basically needed a really nice browser I could carry around without worrying about viruses, updates, or much of anything and I find it way more pleasant than trying to squint at a website on a phone.  Been using it about a week now. Will update if anything changes.--Supported Formats (From Google's Chromebook Help Page)--Microsoft Office files: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt (read-only), .pptx (read-only).Media: .3gp, .avi, .mov, .mp4, .m4v, .m4a, .mp3, .mkv, .ogv, .ogm, .ogg, .oga, .webm, .wavImages: .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webpCompressed files: .zip, .rarOther: .txt, .pdf (read-only)--Update--One last thing, if your a little technical and really desperately need Windows software, Google a Linux distribution called Crouton.  I've not tried it on this one, but the C720 could easily dual boot into Linux with it and I was able to use WINE to run a few Windows programs.  Gave up when it wouldn't work with a 3rd party downloader I needed that was Windows only, but possibly an option and Linux is fun to play around with.  As far as I'm aware, no Chromebook can use an external DVD drive for watching DVD movies, but Crouton might support your drive.  I don't have one to test the theory though.--Update 5/26/15--Sorry, I just realized the correct term for the connector is ""micro HDMI"" not ""mini HDMI"".  I've updated in the review above to reflect the correct term.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HF0JZWHCDWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUV0MG0#wasThisHelpful","R17HF0JZWHCDWB","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife's been complaining about my breath the past few months.  I brush regularly, tongue scrape, etc. and nothing seemed to help.  So got a chance to try these through Vine and see if they'd fix things.  After completing 7 of the 8 day supply, I see some improvement.  The taste isn't bad and they're chewable so no issues with swallowing a pill.I had noticed myself on a few occasions I've had truly foul/sulfur smelling morning breath. Since starting these, I haven't experienced that so they definitely do seem to be doing something.  This week she has complained about my breath exactly once.  In that case, I'd just had one of the tablets and she said my mouth smelled mediciny.  Otherwise, hasn't commented.  This was my primary reason for trying these so I like that.That said, I haven't noticed the other benefits.  My gums have been bothering me in one place and I got a throat ache after starting to take them, but I have no idea if that's from it or in spite of it.  They're also pretty pricy per pill. The package and Amazon listing aren't clear how long they're supposed to help after you've completed a box, but I can't imagine it'll be effective weeks or months later.  Suppose I'll find out soon since tomorrow is my last pill, but if I have to keep taking them daily for the effects then I'll have to find something else since my budget can't take what these are priced at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KF0Z2XHQIMQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN03QMU#wasThisHelpful","R2KF0Z2XHQIMQA","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our dogs tend to get fleas from somewhere.  We think it's one of the neighbor dogs they walk near when we're out on nightly walks, but it could probably be from other sources too.  In any case, we got tired of watching them suffer so tried this.The best option we've found were some expensive pills from the vet that made the fleas very unhappy in a matter of minutes.  These tubes, well they don't work close to as fast and don't work quite as well, but we've never found the pills other than at the vet so this seems to be the best option.  The applicators are what you'd expect and easy enough to use.  It took a while, but after a week or so they'd stopped scratching so it seems to have worked pretty well.The smell on these isn't great, so be ready for some odor.  The other problem is that the dogs really, really didn't like the sensation of the stuff on their back.  We have two, so we used one dosage for each.  We'll have to buy a second package and do the same thing, for three total doses for each.  Make sure if you have a couple dogs, even if you're only dosing one at a time, that you separate them so they don't try to lick it off each other before it drys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1NORTO7A57V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2COU2#wasThisHelpful","R1L1NORTO7A57V","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, we have liked (not loved) the regular Avery ones we've had in the past.  They're good for volunteer to semi-professional applications, though don't take the place of the expensive professionally made cards for looking businesslike.  Those have ridges around them.  These, well these have their own problems.The good, these are a very clever way to make magnetic cards.  If you're a plumber, electrician, or someone that may come up from time to time for when something breaks, magnetic cards are awesome since the customer can put them on their refrigerator and when they think of repairs, there you are.  I'd think that more frequent ones, they have you in their phone so it may not be as valuable, but the 1 offs are important.  Getting those made can be really pricy, so these make a reasonable alternative.  You get very few in the package, only 3 sheets, but they were fairly impressive as far as holding to metal.  They were thin, but we personally didn't see any pulling up at the edges.  Can't say if they might in time, but been a few days and fine so far.Word 2013 had the templates for these so that was convenient.  We had to go to Mailings tab, then Labels, then options, find it, and then go from there.  LibreOffice didn't have templates for it, but that's freeware and I can't count these off for that.  We ran them through one at a time and had no problems with paper jams.  The paper itself was pretty standard fare and showed off the ink jet printing well enough.  They don't look professionally done exactly, but serviceable for a small business.Onto the bad, well the cards just didn't print out that well.  We used the labels, but everything migrated up to the top of the sheet a little bit, so some text was 1 cm from the top, some was 0.5 cm, and some were even slightly sideways.  It also destroyed the first card on every sheet with some kind of ink smear.  So out of all the cards, maybe 60-70% of them were viable.  Those are NOT GOOD ratios considering cost per card.  It may be the magnets.  It may be the thickness.  It may be a combination, but it was very disappointing.So final verdict, would I get these again?  Sadly, the answer is no.  I'm giving it an average rating, because the ones that worked were really quite decent for what they are.  It's possible our printer is an anomaly and they'll work out better in another one.  However at the price per card, I just can't bring my self to to recommend these given the failure rates I saw.  So in short, good if they play nice in your printer and garbage if they don't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IMA59RKL1WE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GAU9M8#wasThisHelpful","R2IMA59RKL1WE9","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've been sitting back from the whole SSD thing because it's the purview of the geek who wants to squeeze out every second of their computer down to the minimum and is willing to pay astronomical prices just to save 3 seconds, then be aware that things are changing.  SSDs are still massively more expensive than the old traditional hard drives, but the price per Gigabyte is dropping fast.  They are fast too.  Under the best circumstances real world you might get close to 500 MB in sequential reads and maybe 450-480 MB range for writes.  Random reads/writes up to 100k / 87k IOPS.  The drive isn't the very fastest out there, but overall it performs well without breaking the bank.---The Drive---This is a 2.5"" drive.  Be sure you know that when buying.  It WILL NOT fit into most desktop systems, without an adapter.  For whatever reason, all theses SSDs I've seen seem to be coming out in the smaller size.  Right now I'm trying it in my laptop, which is what it's designed for, but I'm ordering a Silverstone Tek adapter in case I later want to try this in my Dell XPS 8700 later, because that cheap adapter is supposed to fit in that system.  The power/data connectors are identical for 2.5 or 3.5 SATA so no compatibility concerns there.Laptop installation was painless and took maybe 5 minutes.  The drive itself is tiny, EXTREMELY light weight, and feels like it's aluminum construction which should be good for heat dissipation.  It just feels extremely fragile, so it seems like it'd dent very easily, but then if you've you've dropped a hard drive you've got bigger problems.  The drive comes with a download key for Acronis True Image HD 2014 (more on that below) to copy your old drive to your new one.  This is the first time I've used a Crucial, so I can't say whether I have personal experience it will last a long time, but reviews I've seen generally rate them well.  Intel supposedly makes the best ones, but are also quite a bit more expensive.  I found the read/write speed to be very pleasant and had no concerns.  I think it also runs a bit cooler than my old laptop drive.  I'm also not as nervous if I have to pull out the laptop on the road because hitting a bump won't do the drive any harm.The only things I'm finding cumbersome about this drive is the lack of size.  I got the 250GB (about 231 GB formatted) model and it's pretty tight for my stuff.  The only reason I can fit most on is that I can't play a lot of games on it, so they aren't eating up tons of space.  It's why I'm considering it in my desktop.  What you can do, assuming you get an adapter so it'll fit and your system can accommodate two hard drives, is install one of these as your windows drive and use a traditional hard drive for your music, movies, etc.  Games you may still want on the SSD for performance, but for older/lower end ones you might compromise.  That'll get you the faster boot, avoid defragmenting, and let you get some of the benefits without spending an arm and a leg.I do need to warn you, if you use this to attempt to boost an old laptop running XP or Vista, you'll not be getting the best operation.  The versions Windows 7 and onward have started supporting the Trim functionality, which helps the SSD deal with files the operating system deletes.  I won't bore you with the long version, you can look it up if interested, but the short version takeaway is that you'll have a shorter lifespan under anything earlier than Windows 7.---What is a SSD---Just a quick explanation what a SSD is if you're not familiar.  The traditional hard drive you have is a mechanical device with multiple platters and little heads that read from them.  If you're over a certain age, then think of it as a stack of record players.  If you're a young pup, then look up how record players used to work with the spinning disc and the needle.  The SSD replace those moving parts with memory cells, so you can think of them more as a big USB flash drive in your machine, though they're designed not to wear out as quickly as USB drives do from read/write cycles.So why choose a SSD?  The primary reason is that they are faster, much faster.  I hadn't realized how much faster until I got a Chromebook with one.  My Windows 8 boot is quite a bit faster than the old drive was.  A secondary reason to pick these types are lack of moving parts.  You can still get one that arrives dead or dies quickly, same as with traditional ones, but bouncing/jarring them has no effect and they generate less heat.  In theory, they should last longer than a mechanical hard drive, though they're still too new to have a lot of real world data.  You also don't need to defragment them, the way they work is different so it won't slow them down, in fact doing so will shorten its life.  So minor time saved there as well.  One word of warning, at boot especially they may use a tad more energy than mechanical drives so if you're extremely tight on power it's an outside possibility that could be an issue.---Acronis True Image HD 2014---If you've never used Acronis, it's a disk imaging application at heart.  What this means is it'll take a picture of your drive, store it on another partition/hard drive/etc. and then let you restore that if something goes wrong later.  I've been using a version of Acronis for the better part of a decade and it has saved my rear many a time.  My system backs up an image of itself every week and so if something goes bad, at worst I lost the last weeks' worth of changes.There is no CD or other media in the container, just a piece of paper to download it.  The file size is around 300MB so if you're tight on bandwidth it won't break the bank.  The product key is an astounding 74 characters (give or take if you count hyphens), but they give you a shortened 16 digit one to put in, then you sign up for an account with Acronis, and they email you the long one to copy and paste.  This makes things a bit easier than the retail version.  Just look for an option of ""I only have a short code"" or similar when entering.  Setup of the software was simple and painless.I couldn't find this anywhere, so you should be aware, this is ONLY an OEM version of the software.  One thing I loved about Acronis is I can go to a program I got from them 5 years ago and download it again directly from my account there, so simple and easy.  This time, it provides no link (so back up the installer or don't lose the card!) and says it's a down rev version they don't support any longer and would I like to pay to upgrade.  Since I have the full version, no.  However, you may want to.The version you get includes a rescue media builder which will let you make your own recovery media.  I didn't try it in this version, but in the full version, I was able to create a USB drive with an image of my hard drive, so instead of answering all those setup questions, I just put in the drive, tell it go, and everything up to a few months ago is all set up as I'd left it.  Very handy.  It also includes a drive cleanser, which will try to destroy everything on a hard drive; anything you delete on your PC is not actually deleted, just forgotten until the OS overwrites it later and even then may be recoverable.  A cleanser makes it so if you gave your computer to Goodwill, the next user can't restore that folder of embarrassing selfies you thought were deleted when you formatted it.The disk cloning feature is its primary purpose.  This allows you to take your old hard drive and copy it to the new ones so you can most likely avoid having to reinstall Windows.  The one caveat, if your old hard drive is bigger than your new one, and filed up with more data than the new can handle, then you're out of luck.  It can also do some things like create a partition, though seems to only be able to destroy all of them and do it, not create new ones without hurting your data, can mount the image so you can pull files you need out of an image you made without having to revert your whole computer to that image, and can schedule backups.  However, it's limited in this version and doesn't have Secure Zone.What's it missing, well first off Secure Zone.  That's a great feature that Acronis has that makes a hidden partition on your drive, so nobody can muck with it, and simulates restoring to an external hard drive using your current one.  The only downside, if your whole hard drive dies your backups are gone too obviously, but if you regularly back up from time to time to an external drive you'll be mostly fine.  Hard drives don't die that often so I find that more convenient.  It also lacks a file shredder which does what a disk cleanser does just for specific files/folders without erasing the whole drive, Acronis' recovery manager, individual file backups, and the boot sequence manager.  If you need any of those, you'll have to pay.---Conclusion---Sorry to go on so long, but there was a lot to cover.  I am quite happy with the drive and found it to be fast, convenient, and relatively good for the price.  If you watch you can find some cheaper deals.  Crucial itself had some refurbished ones for sale, briefly before they sold out, for VERY cheap not too long ago.  However, even buying this smallish one here if you can get by with less space on your laptop by using an external hard drive like WD Passport on it, or get an adapter to use this as your Windows drive in your desktop with a 2nd hard drive for storage, then it's a pretty good way to go.  Alternatively, just wait another 5 years or so and probably all the new computers coming out will have SSDs in them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BE2FHUU8XPKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQA6DTE#wasThisHelpful","R2BE2FHUU8XPKV","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, the top priority for one of these is that it's safe.  Little kids can and will topple over things if they're able.  True, I do still have memories of the giant box fan with broken grill parts that we had most of my childhood and we never lost a finger, but why not remove the element of risk if you can?  This fan is a bit pricey, but given it has a 5 year warranty, you can look at it as price per year and it's not half bad.First off, the bits I liked.  The fan feels solid and is not especially easy to tip, a child could still manage it.  The floor is probably the best place for it.  They've protected the fan blades from probing fingers so it's next to impossible your toddler will be able to get a digit inside.  You can move the gray fan part to slightly different angles without any points that could pinch a little hand.  They've also put a nice little cord storage in place under the fan, so you can shorten it and reduce the risk of tripping.  The fan has reasonable power and is not terribly loud, though you'll hear it plenty well at the medium and high settings.  Overall design is solid and attractive.It's small so during the winter or unneeded you can store it away nicely.  The instructions included tell you how to remove the grill for cleaning and they make it pretty easy to remove the blade if you needed to untangle string or something that got inside and wrapped around.  The buttons are soft and won't pose a risk, but the power button is larger so you can find it by touch easily.  There is a nice feature to lock the controls so baby can play with it, but he/she can't actually change anything.  Generally a good idea, given how much they like to explore the controls they see adults using.Now onto the not so great.  The light is essentially a glorified night light with minor brightness controls.  It's not especially soothing by any means, though I suppose if that's the only light you have on in the room, maybe.  The sounds were also fairly unimpressive.  There are 4 tracks.  White noise is roughly equivalent to a fan being on and there isn't much to it.  The water one is pretty good, but if you're listening to it over a baby monitor be ready for frequent trips to the bathroom.  The froggy night one has poorly digitized frog ribbits that sounded cheap.  The womb one may reassure a baby, but both my wife and I found it to be extremely creepy and a slightly older child may be spooked.  We'll better know reaction to the sounds soon when my little niece visits.  The effects remind me of the perfunctory ones included on my alarm clock, where I just bought a dedicated device to have better white noise.As a fan, the thing is exemplary.  There's very little I can fault it for and the fact that it will remember the last settings (if you don't unplug it) until the next time you run it is a VERY nice feature indeed.  Auto shut-off would have been a nice feature though.  Where it falls a little short is in the add-on area.  The extra features on it are nice, but just don't come off as well as the base feature of the device.  However, especially with the warranty, definitely a good product for baby.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4ZGFMBBNTCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XB8WC#wasThisHelpful","R1B4ZGFMBBNTCF","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're running a business, you're better off having cards professionally made.  Plain and simple.  Easy as that.  I know it's expensive, but it's advertising and that's expensive.  Do not get these thinking you'll save a lot of money and still look professional.  You won't.  They're thinner and you can tell at a glance they were made by a home printer so you won't fool anybody.  However, if you're starting some small business or you need them for a church, club, etc. where people won't judge you on them, then these will work well and are a significant improvement over past ones I've tried.I don't remember the number, but we'd tried another Avery business card template years ago.  Those were thin and very bumpy around the edges.  This batch, well they're still a little thin, but not that bad.  They have dramatically improved how they feel around the edges.  You can still feel ridges and tell they're homemade easily enough, but it's not as blatant as the old ones.  Big points for that improvement.Templates weren't an issue with these.  Both Libre Office (nice little free office suite compatible with Microsoft Office) even had the Avery template for this model already present.  I did find Office 2013 to be far more cumbersome in setting up business cards than past versions of the software.  I had to go into create a blank one, go into Mailings, Labels button, then into Options to be able to pick the right one.  The whole ribbon thing just makes things harder, but that's not Avery's fault.  For the actual printing, this is sort of the Tale of Two Printers.  I tried these cards with both our Brother MFC-J430W and an Epson WF-2650 and had dramatically different results.These were tried first in the Brother printer first and the results were horrendous.  They went through the printer with some minor issues, like the sheet of paper below it being pulled in and printed to instead.  You're best bet is to feed one sheet in at a time and then they should go through the printer just fine.  The problem was, even after letting it dry for some time, the ink on the cards came right off when a finger was rubbed lightly over it.  I don't mean smeared a little if you pushed down, I mean a light touch was taking off entire words through light handling.  I couldn't believe it, so I tried another sheet, and the same thing happened.  If I print the cards on the back they look perfect and don't smear, but then it's not glossy.So I came here ready to write a one or two star review, but my wife suggested I try the Epson printer.  So I ran the same exact templates through the Epson and roughly 30 seconds out of the printer there was zero smear.  I think if you had a damp finger you could probably do it, but the difference was so stark it was like using an entirely different set of cards.  The only thing I can possibly think of is that the Brother is set to a lower quality ink output because it's very low ink and we're just using it until it runs out, since the Epson can handle 2-sided printing, so so I'd highly suggest trying it with the printer set to make the ink very dark.  You'll use more ink, but the cards won't be worthless.So the take away is that you have to have the right expectations going in.  These will not be professional grade, however they may very well be good enough if you're one of the more laid back uses above or if you're working with well known clients and it's just to give them contact information and not a first impression.  My sister uses these in her office and they like them, but then they mostly deal with predictable contracts from state agencies so they're not trying to impress anybody to get business.  They're good for what they are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FG7XCCVNUZBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z63P#wasThisHelpful","R1FG7XCCVNUZBP","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game would be a 4 or even a 5 to me except for one thing, the AI in the game is TERRIBLE.  Your little helper monkeys essentially just have nearly unlimited health, though they can die.  I watched Megatron get hit by a train, die, and come speeding along 5 seconds later.  Otherwise, no matter how much they shot or were shot, my teammates didn't go down.  This took a lot of the realism out of it.  They also get in the way more than they help.  I lost track of the times I'd be shooting someone and they'd walk into the shot.  They also had an uncanny way of getting in the way of my dashes when I was trying to drive to avoid a boss.  The mini-bosses with any kind of trick to them were completely beyond their ability to damage even if they were behind them in perfect position.  To top it off, even if equipped with a healing ray, I only had one heal me once the whole time I was playing.  It was just infuriating at this point in gaming that kind of thing would still be done.Aside from that, this was an incredible game.  It's easily the best Transformers one I've ever played, though admittedly that's not many of the recent ones.  You can tell a lot of love went into the voices and the character models.  They look a bit closer to the old 80s show than the recent movies, but there's a little of both in it.  Everybody sounded just perfect.  One of my favorite parts of the whole game was fighting Soundwave and his little helper robots.  Fun!  You also get to see how Megatron ended up with Starcream and he's as delightfully annoying as in the cartoons.The production value for the rest of the game was stellar, though it is a bit short.  I finished the game in roughly 9 hours and a chunk of that was the final boss fight which is fairly difficult.  The story is solid and the plot plausible, so far as a cartoon story about a bunch of living robots on a metal planet can be.  There were few if any glitches I came across and the checkpoint save system was overall quite fair.  I did take issue with the amount of ammo it took to kill an enemy vs. the amount you could carry and some levels were just not fun because of lack of ammo for the guns I liked, but those were the exception more than the rule.  This is not a bad game in my opinion, but it could have been a beautiful work of art with just a bit more attention to the AI of both the good and bad characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EHGHNOQUAPWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030HRNY6#wasThisHelpful","R3EHGHNOQUAPWP","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to try this for two reasons, one I'm getting a bit older and it can't hurt to do a bit to rejuvenate, and my wife who's still as pretty as the day I met her some 12 years ago is getting more and more worried about her face.  I keep telling her she's beautiful, but it's upsetting her so a convenient pocket ""spa treatment"" looked like a really cool idea.  After about a week it's given her a lot more confidence and I'm pretty happy too.  There are some bad experiences in other reviews you should probably check out too when deciding, but neither of us had major issues.The unit comes with a base cradle, cord, and a device that looks kind of like a funny little space alien.  You have to charge it for 12 hours minimum before first use.  Construction feels solid, so I can't tell if the internals will give out in time, but it doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart like the last similar device she had.  I really liked that it made sound when it started the charge routine so I could tell connection had been made.  My wife's last one would sometimes not connect quite right and she'd come back to a dead battery instead of a full charge in the morning.  The battery indicator also lights up on this, so you're not going to have that problem.  I'm always paranoid about how to keep it lasting its longest and according to the instructions it is designed to sit in the cradle when not in use.  Some batteries warn against that or it shortens the life.  Still, since they're NiMh batteries inside, it's not the worst idea in the world to use it down to leave it out once a month or two and let it drain down a bit to keep maximum capacity.Maybe women are made of sterner stuff, but the little zap it gave me was something I could feel on the low setting.  She turned it all the way up to maximum and was complaining she wasn't feeling enough of a zap.  Suffer for beauty I guess.  Anyway, she tried it with some water on her face and started feeling it more, so it made her happy.  I was quite content barely feeling it so the range of settings seems pretty solid for your level of tolerance.  Even at higher ones it didn't exactly hurt me, but was just unpleasant.  I can see a little bit of lift in my own face and she is happy with the way hers is looking.An interesting thing that she also liked and wanted me to mention, and this is just our experience NOT the product design, is that she found it gave her some relief for some mild carpal tunnel syndrome pain in one hand.  I absolutely do not want to tell someone it will cure that and have them buy this device for that and be disappointed, but for her limited symptoms, she said she found some relief by turning it to full and doing it on her wrist.  Basically, if you're buying it anyway and you have some symptoms it probably can't hurt to see if it has any effect for you.There's been only a little love loss with the device.  After using it for maybe 3 times, she suddenly started breaking out with bumps across her face.  She never has breakouts, so it was definitely the device.  However, after a few days they had disappeared and haven't come back since.  I used it for the same number of times with no effect at all and I'm more prone to breakouts, so it's entirely dependent on the person using it, but the important thing is it doesn't seem to be a permanent situation.  If it does happen again or if the device dies prematurely, I'll update my review.One last thing, if you see any other Vine reviews for it, just be aware there is absolutely no pressure to write either a good or bad review.  Zero.  If a reviewer thinks something is a steaming pile of poo, the reviewer can come out and say that with no consequences of any kind.  As with all reviews though, you're MUCH better off reading the whole review to see if the person likes it or hates it for the same reasons you might than by just looking at stars.  I hope you enjoy this like we did, but keep the box since Amazon has a pretty good return policy if you don't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LB1ZZWT4JFCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GG5IZWS#wasThisHelpful","R3LB1ZZWT4JFCQ","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These replace some Sunbeam ones that were so old they'd lost any effectiveness.  I like these a lot better in all except one way, they do not have any kind of outlet on the side as a pass through so they will eat up an entire power outlet slot.  Not a big deal, but just something to be aware of.  It's not a bad idea to write down the date you bought them either, possibly in permanent marker on them, since the instructions say they'll generally last 3-5 years.We've had occasional mouse problems the past year or so.  We had a mount of ""gifts"" left all over the place, convincing us we had a small family roaming our halls at night.  However, a series of traps captured one small mouse which apparently had one heck of a metabolism because there was nothing after that.  I'm the type that normally tries not to kill things, for example we rarely kill spiders unless they're poisonous types, but when it comes to mice they can cause expensive harm and spread disease so we can't put up with them.  So we're VERY interested in anything that will keep them from moving into the house in the first place and avoid having to harm anything in the future again.Installation is simple as can be.  You just plug them into an outlet and you're done.  Just be aware, you need to place them somewhere in an open area so they aren't blocked by anything or the mice will not be bothered enough to leave.  You also should be aware the night light on these is very bright and on 24/7, so plan accordingly.  The instructions say to leave it in the bottom outlet, but we found they'll work well flipped upside down and put into the top.  The lights shouldn't generate much heat, but there's one outlet we decided not to use because it has sort of a hood that the light almost touches and we didn't want to find out heat builds up the hard way with a house fire.A pack of four is a really good size to cover most of the major rooms.  We're thinking we may figure out some way to put an extension cord up into the attic (no outlets sadly) so we can try up there, since that's one place they got in before.  Very small, very handy, like them a lot.  The only annoyance is that we'd kind of like an off switch for the light and even the bigger old ones we had freed up the outlet with a plug on the side.  I'd take slightly bigger to have an outlet, but still a nice product.  I'll update my review if we do get another infestation after putting them in place","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDVKLUNVWJ0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIP1G9W#wasThisHelpful","R2CDVKLUNVWJ0P","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have two dogs and they can smell a bit.  So this looked interesting.  I can't say it was awful, but it was definitely not what we expected.The first problem is the size.  This thing is seriously huge compared to the outlet.  It takes up way too much space and drastically limited where we could put it.  It really needs some sort of cord out of it and to sit on a counter or something.  So in any event, we ended up finding a home for it in my wife's bathroom since she had nothing plugged into one of the outlets.  Today I came home and found it unplugged.  To quote her ""You shouldn't have shut the door.  I almost died when I opened it.""  Set to the lowest, just overnight, door open a crack, and she felt the smell was overpowering.It's not a bad smell, but nothing special really.  Sort of your usual, or slightly above usual, chemical smelling ""freshness"".  It does mask other odors very readily, so it definitely lives up to that promise.  It's just so strong after you leave it on for a bit that you'll only want to use it in a really large room.  Even then, I'm kind of leery of turning it up to full.  So yeah, if you have a big room and need heavy coverage this is great.  If you're very sensitive to smell or have a slightly smaller room, then it's too overpowered in our opinion.  Cut it in about half and we'd probably buy replacements cartridges later, but I doubt we'll even use this one until it's out.  Maybe put it in the garage or something.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFTLUVY5AI7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBGPJFE#wasThisHelpful","RRFTLUVY5AI7Y","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just great.  I can say with no qualifications, they're the best disposable cup I've used.  The sliding cap part at the top is neat and makes it very easy to open and close while preventing minor sloshing out when you drive.  There isn't any need for an outside cup holder or double-cupping, because the cup has that sort of fuzzy feeling insulation around the outside.  I suppose if you were very sensitive to heat, it might still be a good idea to save a few of those paper outer things off the coffee you pick up at work or something, but I had no problems with even very hot stuff.  My wife really loves these as a quick ""to go"" cup.The only thing I can say bad about these is the price per cup is steeper than you may be used to, but they're not VERY expensive.  These are probably not a good replacement for the travel mug you take to work each day or a good one for a business, but as a little bit of luxury for when you forgot to wash the other one and need something quickly or you have a guest to give coffee to and would like to be a little impressive, then they are definitely perfect for that.--Update 02/04/15--My wife was testing it and found that the lids worked on some cheaper cups we'd picked up, so she's saving the lids now and reusing them a bit which adds some more value and is a tiny bit better for the environment not tossing them so something that might work out for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334HY6S3YEM0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O3GSX4C#wasThisHelpful","R334HY6S3YEM0F","A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from a $12 belt, and when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised, as I really liked the shade of green when I ordered it and it's the same color in 'real life'. (Note that they call this color ""olive"" but it's really a much brighter more intense green than that.)The buckle looks like the cheap gold-tone it is, but for $12 what do you expect.However, I'm probably going to return it because it's *too* stretchy. I ordered the medium because while I wear a 36"" slack, I would normally have ordered the 38-40"" belt. However, I thought that if I got the 34-36"" belt (which the medium is supposed to be) that it might be snugger, as I didn't want a loose belt and many braided stretch belts are.

"I'm a Vine reviewer and when offered this I figured 'what the heck' as there was something in the description or some review that made me want to try it. I'm a guy with baby-fine straight hair who also has a very oily scalp. This is a bad combination because I need a shampoo that gets the oil off but not that has any conditioner as almost anything weighs the hair down too much.I used this and from the first time noticed that it does indeed get rid of all of the oil, and I can see why some folks think it leaves their hair too dry, especially if they have longer hair. (Mine is sort of typical guy's length short, with some length on top.)What surprised me is that after I blew dry the hair I noticed that it felt fuller and looked thicker. I have no wave and this didn't add any wave, but I like the look and feel and the thickness without any feeling of greasiness or oiliness or waxiness.I don't like the smell, especially, but since it goes away when you rinse it off, it doesn't matter.

"I have been using electric shavers for about 20 years. I used to use Braun, and then fell in love with the various incarnations of the ""3 head"" Panasonics (I put that in quotes because they have two cutting foils) like the ES8109/8103 and the Arc3. They work well, and I find great prices on them and they charge quickly so I figured I'd stick with them and maybe later move to one of the more expensive models if I wanted more cutting foils to speed things up.THEN, you ask, why did I request (as a Vine reviewer) this Norelco to review? Well... because I lost a great deal of weight and I now find that my round, plump, easy to shave face doesn't work as well with the Panasonics because I now have a gaunt face and lots of bone structure and sharp edges, and it's just harder to shave, either with an electric or a blade.I looked at this Norelco and it looks to me as though it might work better at 'getting around corners' and indeed it does. As for the rest of it:1) Build quality: It seems fine and on par with the Panasonics and Brauns I've used.2) Charging: It charges quickly, about at the rate my latest P. does, which is under an hour and quickly enough for one shave in under 10 minutes.3) Comfort: Seems fine, which means it's like the P's, since I don't notice anything.4) Closeness: This is a difficult one because on the smooth places, I think the Panasonics provide a closer shave, but I have to struggle with them to get around the corners and this does a better job around the corners.When all is said and done, for me it would be about price: As I review this, the price is $140, which seems mid-market for high end shavers. But... I often find the Panasonics I like on sale for $80/90, perhaps because they are older models, and I don't think this is worth the difference. If it's on sale, then they're well-matched.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLAYAZ35OX6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","RDLAYAZ35OX6A","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these boat shoes when they were on sale for half the usual Amazon price, and I think that they are a great deal at half price. At the usual price ($110) at Amazon I think they're still a good deal and since the half price isn't common I'm reviewing them on the full price basis.One of the things that I like about companies like Rockport and Allen Edmonds is that the size I take doesn't change from shoe to shoe. Even with Amazon's generous free return policy for much of their clothing stock, I dislike the guessing game about sizes. That continues to be true of this shoe, as I don't think I should have gotten a different size. They are perhaps a bit wider and have a wider toe box than I'm used to in Rockports, but it's a subtle thing.They have decent arch support and a more padded feel than most boat shoes do. Rockport used to be known for that and in recent years they've moved away from the ""running shoe feel that looks like a dress (or whatever) shoe"".  This shoe hits a middle ground: not nearly as padded as they were years ago, but far more so than most boat shoes.The images on the web are just slightly off, as they are more brown (vs tan) when you get them than to me they appear on the web which I think was a matter of lighting when they were photographed. Other than that, what you see is what you get.NOTE: When I glanced at the page it had the size I wear all messed up. I wear a size 13 in Rockports and if they had a just slightly narrower shoe than the D, I might have gotten it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRF5YFLYMOQLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R791Z06#wasThisHelpful","RRF5YFLYMOQLC","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm at a loss as to how to review these because I can't figure out the difference between this set (which is currently selling for $15) and a set I was given to review a couple of months ago that is currently selling for $9-something. Both are from Clipperton and both are high-glass chrome finishes. The packaging is slightly different, but holding one from each set together I can't see or feel any difference.These say that they are brass with a chrome finish, which is exactly what the others say. They both look like very standard, pleasant chrome shower rings, and they move identically. Also, I should note that while I was given both of these sets as a Vine reviewer and have had this set only briefly and the other free set for a couple of months, I selected these because I bought a set of these rings (from Clipperton) two years ago and they look and work now just as they did then.So while these are fine, look nice, and move as one would expect, I'd search for Clipperton on amazon and buy the less expensive set (which oddly, comes in what looks like slightly higher-end packaging) rather than paying half again as much for these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9M06YGAVU68F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTDO8ZA#wasThisHelpful","R9M06YGAVU68F","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite new non-gaming mouse. For many years I've been using nothing but Logitech mice, both for myself and for the people at work (for whom I often order computers and peripherals). For years I had no problems finding mice I liked, but recently I haven't like the wireless options. It seemed that the ones I liked were either small laptop-oriented mice or were the large clunky ones. I'm a big guy with good-size hands but I don't like huge mice.What I wanted was a standard-sized desktop mouse with 1) buttons on the left where my thumb is that for back and forward (or could be configured to work that way), and 2) a button I could assign to do whatever I wanted. And I wanted that button in a convenient location.That seemed oddly difficult to find but my M520 died and I gave this a shot and it's terrific, so long as you want a right-handed mouse. Some details:1) the button just behind/below the wheel isn't configurable (using the SetPoint software Logitech provides) as it serves to switch the wheel from smooth to ""notch"" behavior.2) It has two buttons on the left that by default act as forward and back (for web and other uses) that happen to fall where my thumb falls.3) There is a subtle bulge on the lower left (that isn't like the huge bulges some of their big mice used to have) that if you press with your thumb (or just roll the thumb down a bit) with a huge variety of customizable options. It took me about an hour to get used to it and now I prefer it to a button on the top of the mouse because I don't have to move my hand to press it.4) Like all new Logitech products, it uses a ""Unifying"" receiver, which allows you to use one (tiny) dongle to work with any number of Logitech products. Incidentally, note that while your mouse or keyboard comes pre-configured to work with the its own dongle, there is a Logitech utility that lets you configure the dongle to work with other devices.  Note that this is *NOT* Bluetooth pairing - these are not BT devices which is great as Logitech advertises 3-year battery life for the 2 AA batteries you'll need.What's nice too is that this mouse is selling for about $30 on amazon as I write this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5A8RQ5H3O05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TG75EG#wasThisHelpful","R2A5A8RQ5H3O05","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this to review through the Vine program and was interested to do so, and have tried it both with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. I used to wonder why the Margaritaville series was so expensive, but now that I've used this one I understand, as this is far more than a blender. That may seem obvious but if you only look at the front view it looks like a blender with an ice hopper on top. You have to look at the side view to realize it's more involved than that.The basic functionality is that you add the drink mix (minus the ice cubes) to the blender and ice top the hopper on top. If you use the automatic cycle, the machine will shave the ice, drop it into the blender (which has a blade like a regular blender would) in the right proportions, and will then turn itself off. I was skeptical at first that it would get this right, but it certainly seems to, regardless of whether you are using alcohol.If you don't want to use the automatic cycle, there is a manual cycle, which basically is a switch that allows you to run the shaver or the blender blades independently as long as you like. You push (and hold) a toggle switch on the control panel in the up position to shave the ice and the down position to use the blender blades.There is also a reservoir to allow you to drain unneeded ice for disposal. This doesn't seem all that essential to me as you can just dump it out, but maybe I'm just missing that. It certainly doesn't hurt to have it.Oh... I almost forgot to mention that the consistency of the drinks is very nice and what you'd expect from a good frozen margarita or daiquiri.I'm not sure I'd buy this for myself but I think it would make a terrific wedding present for people whom you knew really enjoyed frozen drinks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNIJV5OFFORO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ5CV10#wasThisHelpful","RKNIJV5OFFORO","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these won't replace a real whiteboard, they are a terrific idea for those times when you need a whiteboard and can't get one. I teach 'computer stuff' in technology topics for different firms, and sometimes I have to teach in rooms with flipcharts or easels, but no whiteboards. This seems odd but the class sizes can sometimes be small and we're using a room that isn't designed for presentations.In these classes, I have small groups of 3 students doing design work that can only really be done where they have a surface on which they can constantly change their ideas, like a whiteboard or blackboard. Without something like that, the exercises just don't work. While these can only be erased 20 times (and they don't wipe quite as cleanly as a well-maintained real whiteboard) they are a life saver for times like this and I can take multiple packages with me if needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ILVLNDDDIDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPOJGS6#wasThisHelpful","R26ILVLNDDDIDY","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are certainly 'prettier' designs out there (this one is monochromatic and plain) but I needed one this size, and because it was going to be used in a vestibule that is tile mosaic, I didn't want something that would clash with that.If you want something more attractive in itself, and are OK with something a little larger, then look at others.

The width and strength means that often one piece will do, and that's good as it doesn't seem to stick to itself as well as some other tapes I like, such as the Duck HP260.However, this stuff is pretty expensive and while I'm enjoying my free roll (as a Vine reviewer), I'm not sure I'll buy it. I think I'd rather get HP260 and have to use more and save the money.One other thing: I often ship boxes and I print the shipping label and then tape it to the box, and I like to completely cover the label with tape. In that case, clearly any cheapo clear shipping tape will do, and that's fine.

"This is a lovely grill. It looks and feels like Le Creuset. I've only had it a little while so I have no idea if it will hold up well since the big difference between Le Creuset and imitators seems to be that some of the latter become chipped over time. But at least when I first got it, and after a number of uses, I can't tell the difference.One issue I have that was partly the maker's fault and partly amazon's, is that the packaging was a mess when I got it because of insufficient padding. The retail packaging offers no padding or protection and amazon shipped it in a much larger box with some crinkled paper, but not enough that the retail box wasn't beaten up quite a bit. I'm a Vine reviewer and was given this for free, so it didn't matter, but were I going to give this as a gift, I'd have asked amazon to replace it as the presentation is awful. I'd never buy something with a retail box in this condition in a store.If I had the choice between this and Le Creuset, for the same price point, I'd go for the Le C, if just because it's a known quantity with a reputation for durability. But for a significant difference in price, I'd sure give this a shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F87ESK8T92JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP3JV8E#wasThisHelpful","R1F87ESK8T92JD","AR74YY08IP2WE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR74YY08IP2WE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I was given these for free to review (as a Vine reviewer), but this is one of those cases where had I think I'd buy this set anyway (though in a different color than the white that was sent) because I really like these sheets. There's nothing ""special"" about them but they're the way I think nice sheets should be: They're all cotton and they feel like cotton that will wear well. I have little patience for inexpensive-but-really-high-thread-count all cotton sheets because that inevitably means that really short fibers were used and they don't have a nice 'hand'.I washed these right away and of course they aren't all smooth (I won't iron sheets) but they're almost exactly what I'd expect from a traditional, well-made all-cotton percale sheets. They have a nice weight to them.As I write this amazon is charging a little over $50 for them and that seems fair for a nice quality set of this nature.

"This is a great case, consistent with OtterBox standards and will provide adequate protection for most people.  Even though the case itself is lighter and thinner than the case I am currently using it appears as though it would cushion my phone under typical use.

This case does not come with a clear shield for the front but it would be really simple to put on a protective cover.

The phone have have put this case on is one that is subjected to much rougher handling.  This phone is routinely taken in construction areas, falls out of a pocket onto a hard surface, knocked off tables, dropped and other abuses on a regular basis.

"This one of the earlier Saint adventures, one that had originally appeared as two separate magazine stories were then combined by Charteris into this adventure. Years later this adventure was further adapted into a movie version as well.Simon and Patricia have left England to tour the continent, more to allow the British police to calm down from Simon's recent activities than to pursue any further adventures.  Still Simon, being Simon, could not possibly let an opportunity pass by so when a former adversary appeared in the neighborhood, as well as crown jewels worth a fortune Simon was determined to separate the two.  Aiding Simon and Patricia in this adventure was an old friend, Monty who was quite new to this adventuring life.  The question was though would Monty really live to tell the tale?As is the norm with these stories there is never really any question as to whether or not Simon will be successful and of course he will survive without suffering any permanent harm.  There will be one improbable coincidence after another, coupled with amazing strokes of luck which will allow our hero to always escape with mere seconds to spare.  It is up to the reader to suspend all doubts and simply enjoy the story.  Additionally the reader must keep in mind that these early stories were written more than 80 years ago, the high speed car chases involved speeds we all travel every day, the police could be easily eluded and rarely communicated with their counterparts even a few miles away.So pull up an easy chair, open this novel and join Simon and Patricia as they tear through Europe on this madcap adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6MZIBGMHA2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0I02ZC#wasThisHelpful","RN6MZIBGMHA2E","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This comes in a very attractive box, and in a nice little bag (perfect for packing this necklace and perhaps some matching earrings when traveling) which would be a consideration when presenting this as a gift.  The necklace itself is very pretty.  The silver chain is delicate but feels substantial enough to wear well.  The clasp is large enough to operate easily but not so big that it would be a detraction if it happens to work its way to the front.  There is a little extra silver heart shaped tag, stamped with 'Hallmark' that I could do without but it is by no means a deal breaker, just not necessary in my opinion.  The length of the chain (plus included extensions) allows the stone to sit in a good position, just far enough down that it will be visible in an open shirt, or sit comfortably around a lightweight turtleneck etc.  The stone itself is a deep vibrant blue and of a good size - large enough to be seen but not so big as to be gaudy or obtrusive.  The setting is delicate, in good scale with the size of the stone and the chain, but it also appears to be substantial enough to hold the stone securely.The only negative comments I have to make about this about the price and the labelling - it is a bit more than I would be willing to pay for this.  I can easily find similar necklaces without all the 'Hallmark' labelling for less.  I do not feel that being labelled 'Hallmark' is worth paying extra for, although others may disagree, and would like this better without all the advertising.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEGZPDYG5MSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XK1IDEG#wasThisHelpful","R3UEGZPDYG5MSX","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have given this a five star rating because I, personally have enjoyed it immensely.  For someone who is not a fan of period mystery novels, who does not understand life in the early twentieth century the rating would be less.  Unless the reader also enjoys the early Poirot (Christie), or Wimsey (Sayers), or Saint (Charteris) novels this one will probably not be nearly a five star experience.  And unless someone is already a fan of Ellery Queen in some form this is probably not a good starting point.Each lunchtime a crowd has been gathering to watch a model conduct a live demonstration of some advante garde home furnishings in the window of a large department store.  Today though the demonstration was not quite as 'live' as planned, the corpse of the wife of the owner became a part of the show.  Inspector Queen was called in to investigate the case, and soon his son Ellery found himself involved when one of the suspects was revealed to be an old friend.  Together father and son, assisted by the NYPD manage to solve the case despite a number of false clues.  As always with this series all the clues are fairly presented for the reader to follow, and a challenge is issued for the reader to do so just before the reveal.This series is contemporary to the period in which the story is written.  This is different from a period novel in which the author is writing about a time in the past primarily because the author of a contemporary novel will assume the reader will understand the setting while the period novelist will explain many details.  In this series the 21st century reader must keep in mind that besides the lack of modern day procedures and professionalism in the police force there were great differences in society in general.  Household servants were the norm, jobs for middle class women were not.  And rank had much more privilege then than it does now, allowing Inspector Queen to bring Ellery in on cases on a regular basis, even allowing Ellery to behave in an extremely arrogant manner to other members of the NYPD.Despite these quirks these early novels are not without their charm.  They offer a glimpse into life of nearly a hundred years ago while telling a challenging mystery story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KHR9X0AZPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1MSIT6#wasThisHelpful","R20KHR9X0AZPQ","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Often when writers take over well loved characters the result is less than stellar, the familiar characters are forced to say things they never would say, behave in ways they never would behave and are placed in situations where they are most uncomfortable.  Often odd new characters are introduced or key elements of the series are altered.  Every now and then though an author steps in and continues the story, honoring the established traditions without merely rehashing old material and managing to tell an excellent story as well.  Happily Goldsborough has managed to carry on the series almost seamlessly from Stout.As this story opens in the late 1970's long time associate Lon Cohen asks Wolfe for a favor.  Cameron Clay, a newspaper colleague, who is an abrasive, muckracking columnist, has been receiving threats, ones that Cohen feels should be taken seriously.  Out of respect for Lon Wolfe agrees to speak to the Clay even though Wolfe holds the journalist's work distasteful.  After meeting him both Wolfe and Archie have come to the conclusion that Clay is as unpleasant in person as he is in print.  When Clay is found dead, an apparent suicide, not everyone is convinced that Clay had not been murdered - a suspicion that Wolfe shares.  Soon Wolfe has sent Archie on the trail, bringing together the most likely suspects of the very large group that disliked Clay, personally as well as professionally.  In order to sort out the truth Archie finds that he needs the help of not Saul or Orrie this time but that of his long time lady, Lily Rowan.  Of course in the end the matter is brought to a close in a most satisfactory manner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ER8NEOZL7LDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504023579#wasThisHelpful","R3ER8NEOZL7LDN","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine a world where Rome did not fall, where it managed to continue to expand it's Empire pushing eastward to be stalled by the Mongol and west, across the Atlantic to the lands the Vikings had discovered a few years before.  Little was known about this land other than it was peopled by barbarians who would be no more difficult for Roman legions to bring into submission than the numerous other tribes that had conquered in the past.  There was a special incentive for Rome to add these lands to the Empire, there were reports of gold in these new lands, gold that the Empire had great need for in order to maintain their ever expanding frontiers.The young Roman in charge of the invasion force had managed to bring his troops across the Atlantic, to land in the Chesapeake Bay.  The Romans had quickly dispatched the coastal tribes and then set forth traveling due west in search of the great cities that were said to lie there.  As the Romans penetrated further into the new lands the resistance they encountered increased until they finally came face to face with the Chahokia a military force that just might be able to bring Rome to it's knees.As is the norm with alternate history stories the differences start out fairly simply, one or two major events diverge from history as we know it.  In this case Rome did not fall, an Emperor was not killed and the Empire continued to expand.  After the initial event(s) though the differences continue and spread.  Here the native Americans are not only well organized themselves but they have developed some fairly sophisticated weaponry themselves that put them on a more equal footing with the Roman Legion.  Some of this technology would be plausible for a prospering Neolithic culture others require a big leap for the reader.  This sort leap is not unusual in any sort of speculative fiction and so is not a fatal flaw in this novel.  A bigger problem is the rather sketchily drawn characters.  Other than the main character there is little to distinguish the remaining characters from each other.  Basically they enter, perform their tasks and exit telling the reader nothing of substance about themselves.  It's too bad because there are some really interesting stories to be told here.  I hope that the author will get to them in the next novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22EGQARLXJBJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PENH2#wasThisHelpful","R22EGQARLXJBJM","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy time travel themed stories so I began this one with some high hopes.  The heroine, Lara, is appealing, her problem - preventing her mother's death - compelling.  The author has done an excellent job of establishing a believable universe, unfortunately her characters are not as well drawn.  The parents in particular are one dimensional, cardboard figures who behave in unrealistic ways.  After a strong start the story goes down hill with only a few interesting developments along the way.  The ending is open ended and not very satisfying at all.Overall this is a passable novel, perhaps a YA reader who is unfamiliar with better examples of the genre would enjoy it but there are better stories available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MB4CRZJPNWR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB7RV60#wasThisHelpful","R3MB4CRZJPNWR2","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The problem with having a favorite author is that at some point, no matter how prolific that author is, you will realize that you have read everything available and, if the author has died, you know there will be no more.  Occasionally an undiscovered work might emerge, although often it is apparent why the project had been tucked away out of sight but for the most part all the reader can do is re-read old favorites or look around for another writer to fill the void.  Sometimes though another avenue is available, a new author will pick up their pen and carry on the adventures of a favorite character.  Once in a while the results are satisfactory, even excellent and so a beloved series continues for a bit longer, other times the results are painfully bad and the reader is left feeling upset.  This effort falls somewhere in-between.  The author hasn't quite revived the true Poirot but she hasn't insulted him either, the problem Poirot is presented with is a challenge worthy of his talents and one that he meets fairly, presenting all the clues for his companion (and the reader) to pick up on or not.Poirot has taken up temporary residence in a London boarding house in order to take a break from his rising fame.  One evening, while dining in a neighborhood cafe Poirot meets a young  woman who makes some astonishing statements before dashing off into the night.  Upon returning to his temporary residence Poirot's fellow boarders, a rising young police officer with whom he has struck up an acquaintance is visibly shaken by a case he was working on.  Three people were found murdered in a nearby hotel, which was disturbing enough, but the three crimes, although identical in nature appear to have nothing in common other than being murdered on that day and in that hotel.  Intrigued by the crimes Hercule soon joins the investigation which leads to events that took place in a country village long ago.This is a story worthy of Poirot, and one that incorporates many of Christie's favorite elements - village scandals, tragedies caused by gossip, red herrings and false alibis - to challenge the Belgian's famous little grey cells.  Unfortunately one of Christie's traits that this author did not copy was Christie's spare style.  Christie's stories always get right to the point and move along at a brisk pace.  This novel would benefit greatly from being trimmed quite a bit.  Some scenes drag on for too long, some descriptions are overly detailed leaving this reader at least wanting to skim through long sections to get to the good parts.  The good parts are there, it's just too bad there is so much unnecessary other bits cluttering up an otherwise good story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P27NF1B3185L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYNGP8A#wasThisHelpful","R2P27NF1B3185L","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The towels held up well to being washed and do a good job of drying glass wear without leaving lint behind.

Anyone expecting to dry a couple sinks full of dishes and pans will be disappointed.

"This is the 4th in the CeCe Caruso series of chick lit mysteries.CeCe has been hired to organize the gala opening of a housing development based on Agatha Christie's mysteries.  Even though CeCe considers this a dubious venture in southern California even in the best of economic times (these were far from the best of times) who was she to turn a paying job?  After all as her accountant, who had arranged the job, so frequently pointed out, writing biographies of dead mystery writers was not exactly steady work.  CeCe was in need of a little stability in her life just now, her daughter and son-in-law had just gotten custody of his son from a former relationship, and were expecting a baby themselves and CeCe was in the midst of planning her own long awaited wedding to Gambino.  CeCe had arranged a location for the reception, found a dress, had everything but a date - much to the annoyance of her fiance.Life got a bit more complicated though when a dead body turned up at the gala opening, once again drawing CeCe into an investigation - further annoying her long suffering boyfriend.This is the fourth book in this series that I have read and the first one I have really gotten into.  The premise of focusing on a different mystery author in each book is interesting, the characters, particularly CeCe have grown on me over time but this is the first of the series I have given more than 3 stars.

"CeCe Caruso began her career as a biographer of mystery writers by writing a book about Dashiell Hammett.  The most successful aspects of the book, at least from CeCe's point of view, was that it had gotten her out of her disastrous marriage and launched her career which allowed to support herself and her daughter.  Now that the book was finally going to be made into a movie CeCe was once again reaping the rewards.  She was hired to  coach the actor hired to play the lead about the life of Dashiell Hammett.  CeCe was delighted until she realized that the actor, Rafe, was certainly good looking, and definitely charming but he was not the sharpest tool in the shed nor particularly interested in learning about the subject.  Still it was some easy money which CeCe had a need for so what could go wrong?  Well all too soon CeCe found out, when she became involved in yet another real life mystery, one that lead to bullets crashing into her own home.This is the third in the series of chick lit mysteries.

"This is the 19th in the SPENSER series, originally published in 1993.A 15 year old girl and her baby were gunned down in the street, victims of the never ending gang wars that were raging in the neighborhood.  Knowing that the police department would probably not spend much time or effort on the crime, a local tenant's association hired Hawk to look into the matter, placing Spenser in the unusual position of following Hawk's lead.  Together the two sort through the complicated gang structures in order to determine why the girl had been murdered, and who had committed the crime.On the homefront Spenser was also treading into danger.  His long term girl friend, Susan, had suggested (decreed) that Spenser move in with her and their shared custody dog, Pearl.  The question for Spenser was whether it was more risky to be out on the streets or in his own living room?This is a very long running series, and as is common with long running series, the real draw is the on going interactions between the recurring characters rather than the crime being investigated.  There is little question that Spenser and/or Hawk will be successful, it is of more interest how they achieve that success and how their own lives will be impacted by their actions.This is a well written story, full of action, filled with interesting characters.  The stories are very quick reads - an ideal way to spent a lazy afternoon or a quiet evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20YKBNFHZB20F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F4CD4W#wasThisHelpful","R20YKBNFHZB20F","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 15th in the Spenser series.  It is also happens to be the first one I have read, and other than a vaguely remembered episode or two of the TV series it is my introduction to the series.  This is probably not the best place to start the series.A serial killer has been stalking black women, murdering them in a particularly sadistic manner and then leaving a red rose on their body.  Parker has been called in to aid in the investigation and before long the killer begins to taunt him and even worse begins to target Susan, Spenser's long term girl friend.  As Spenser, aided by Hawk, continue to investigate while now protecting Susan we readers are given brief glimpses into the killer's thoughts.  As with all long running series there is never any doubt that our hero(s) will triumph in the end, the point of the story here is how Spenser and company manage to solve the crimes.This is a well written story, filled with interesting, believable characters and written in a witty style.  I will be backtracking in this series, reading the earlier novels to fill in the blanks in the back stories of the main characters since Parker, unlike most series authors, seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0O4GHU029AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TXZS5S#wasThisHelpful","RY0O4GHU029AX","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th in the MAX TUDOR series of cozy mysteries.Summer has arrived in the little corner of the world that former MI5 agent turned Vicar Max Tudor has come to call home.  Max and the love of life, Awena have spent the weeks since the events of A PAGAN SPRING working out a mutually acceptable way to marry, a thorny problem when the village Vicar's bride to be is a neo-pagan!  The villagers are not nearly as concerned about the details of the upcoming ceremony as much as the timing - would the pair marry before or after the baby arrived?  When Max was summoned to a meeting with his Bishop he assumed that word of his unconventional circumstances had reached the Bishop, and Max was going to be fired.  It was a huge surprise when instead the Bishop wanted Max to once again use the skills he had learned at MI5 to solve another crime.  And what a crime!  A local aristocrat had been poisoned...by a fruitcake...that had come from a local nunnery.  A rather bewildered Max set off to the nunnery, to try to sort which, if any, of the 31 nuns in residence had tried to poison one of their most generous benefactors.  Of course Max will sort out everything in the end but the biggest question is if he can do it and get to his wedding on time?This is a charming series of cozies, with all the usual cozy elements:  picturesque setting (a charming little village); main character sleuth with an unusual trait (MI5 agent turned Vicar) on going romantic interest (lovely neo-pagan Awena) etc,  The series also goes in for all the usual cliched plot devices - long lost heirs, hidden identities, long concealed secrets, hidden staircases, clues that just happen to arrive at just the right time etc.  The author spins these tales with her tongue firmly in her cheek, gently poking fun at the genre while providing a fun read.There are a few problems with the series, and this book in particular though.  First this book, like the other novels in this series are crammed full of characters that are a challenge for the read to keep straight.  A list of characters is thoughtfully provided at the beginning of the book, but it is a bit annoying that it needs to be consulted so frequently.  This novel also stars out rather slowly but the action does finally build quite nicely as the story continues....at least until the reveal.  As Max is explaining what happened it is as if the author had written several versions of the scene, and couldn't decide which one to use so just sent along all of them.  The same information is given about 5 times, making this scene much too long and redundant.  Other than those issues this is a fun read, one that maintains the best of the cozy genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7YUS5LH9TZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021413#wasThisHelpful","R1W7YUS5LH9TZL","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the MAC TUDOR series of cozy mysteries featuring an MI5 agent turned village Vicar.Max Tudor's new life as a vicar in a small village has taken some unexpected turns in the last few months.  The murder rate in the little town has climbed alarmingly - a town bully, reclusive writers, members of the local gentry...all have bit dust and even though Max has managed to bring the killers to justice still the bodies keep piling up!  And it isn't as though Max doesn't have enough other things to do - there is his parish to run, an ancient church that requires almost full time attention to keep up and his budding romance with Awena, a beautiful woman with decidedly unorthodox religious views.Once again Max is back home, looking forward to spending the weeks leading up to Easter as a time for quiet enjoyment of the English countryside.  Little did he realize that once again the village population was due for some reductions.  As Max looks into the crime he is drawn into stories of long ago crimes that had gone unpunished.As with most cozies the details of the story require the reader to not look too closely. - coincidences abound, chance meetings, clues that conveniently appear at just the right time - all the cliches turn up.  The true appeal to this series, as with most cozies, is not the mystery as much as the characters, particularly the recurring ones and their on going stories.  In order to really appreciate this one reading at least one, and better still both, of the earlier books is needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMS9HFT31YIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043263#wasThisHelpful","R1GMS9HFT31YIW","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Max Tudor, former MI5 agent turned Vicar, is traveling back from a rather boring conference when he shares a train compartment with a woman from a nearby village.  A short time later he learns that the woman has died under rather unusual circumstances and once again Max is called upon to use all of skills to ferret out the truth in this delightfully complicated tale.This is the usual cozy fare, a charming out of the way location, filled with quirky characters, an impossibly high crime rate and an investigator with some unique qualifications.  Former MI5 agent turned Vicar is pretty darned unique!  The location is interesting, many of the village characters are well written enough to lure the reader back for more.  As is often the case with cozies, the details of the crime, the method, motive etc are a stretch, and the circumstances involving the sleuth really don't bear close examination.  Realism isn't really the attraction in this genre, and this series is no exception.  The point to cozies in general, including this one, is gentle escapism to an imaginary location, filled with interesting characters for some adventure that everyone knows will turn out happily in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JX7CRC9RU12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125002904X#wasThisHelpful","R8JX7CRC9RU12","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first in the MAX TUDOR series.Max Tudor had lived an interesting life working for MI5 but after a disastrous mission he needed a career change.  The career he chose though was an unusual one - village priest.  Little did he realize that his old job skills would be called up so often in this new life of his.  Instead of dealing with foreign agents or terrorists Max found himself contending with the village bully.  As he contemplated a way to curb the bully's overbearing ways someone else took matters into their own hands and killed the woman.  Now Max drew upon his old skills to discover who would take such a drastic step and why but along the way Max discovered that there more than a few long kept secrets in this sleepy little village.This is a strong beginning to this new series.

"This is the third (and final?) ST JUST mystery.St Michael's is certainly not the first college anyone thinks of when Cambridge University is mentioned.  In fact most would not even think of it at all which meant that funding for the college was always a difficulty.  In order to address the issue the administration had devised the strategy of inviting groups of successful graduates to college reunion visits, in the hope the former students might be inclined to made some donations.  The current group seemed particularly promising, a group who had attended the college in the late 1980's and who had all done quite well for themselves.  Unfortunately after al the arrangements had been made it was pointed out that not all the experiences this group had while in residence had been happy ones.  The Bursar only hoped that enough time had passed for the attendees to have forgotten any unpleasant memories, at least enough to write out some generous checks before they departed.  His hopes were dashed though when one of the most successful former students just departed, permanently and on the school grounds.  There's nothing like a murder to put a damper on the festivities!As usual the author pokes gentle fun at mystery cliches as the story unfolds.  Long hidden secrets are revealed, old scandals are revisited in the stately setting of the ancient university in the style made famous by so many writers before.  The mystery is moderately challenging but the real attraction to this series is the author's sly sense of humor.There is a slight story arc to this series, so reading the books in order is a good idea although not completely necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSRXIQ9C1GYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738719676#wasThisHelpful","R2QSRXIQ9C1GYX","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second in the ST JUST series of novels.  There is a slight overall story arc to this series, reading in order has some advantage but is not strictly necessary.A writers' conference is being held in most romantic setting - a Scottish castle turned into an elegant resort hotel.  Writers from both sides of the pond have turned up to promote their books - a cross section of romances, cozies, police procedurals and thrillers.  Added to this mix to provide the expert's point of view is DCI St Just.  His nice little holiday though turns into business as usual when the castle becomes sealed off from the outside world and a body turns up.Once again the author combines a neat little send up of literary genres, this time chick lit, historical romances, thrillers etc are gently skewered as a mystery story is skillfully told.  This is meant as a fun read, which it certainly is and although the mystery is moderately challenging the characters rarely rise above the cliched level.There is a slight story arc to this series  so it would be good to read it in order although not strictly necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H18AKWYQL8Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738712477#wasThisHelpful","R2H18AKWYQL8Q5","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of the ST JUST series, and, I believe, the first published work for the author as well.Sir Adrian Beauclerk-Fisk is a very successful writer, famous for his popular series of cozy mysteries.  Unfortunately he was much less successful as a human being, and an abject failure as a parent.  His first wife had long since left, leaving behind their four children to be raised by a succession of nannies and boarding schools until each also fled to live their own dysfunctional lives.  All were surprised when they were summoned back to the family estate to attend Sir Adrian's upcoming wedding.  Spurred more by self interest than affection the group came together only to find themselves in a classic cozy mystery plot - there are long hidden family secrets, false identities, a mass of motives and a truly astonishing body count.The author has managed to roll just about every cozy mystery cliche into this novel and still written an engaging story.  The book does get off to a slow start, most of the first half of the book is devoted to stage setting but once the bodies start dropping the pace picks up.  After all is finally revealed it becomes apparent that all the little bits of information given out in the beginning do have relevance and rather cleverly contribute to the solutions to the various mysteries.  Once such little detail - all of Sir Adrian's mysteries had exactly 26 chapters and does this novel.St. Just's adventures continue in DEATH AND THE LIT CHICK.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDMIE2PLVU9VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738712485#wasThisHelpful","RDMIE2PLVU9VE","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are two adventures that are story versions of episodes from 1960's The Saint television series so it is quite possible they may seem familiar. The first adventure involves Simon uncovering an art hoax in Europe and the second involves a coup in an emerging African nation.  Whether the reader has seen the tv episodes or is discovering these stories for the first time these are fun Saint adventures.  Simon is, of course, dashing and always one step ahead of everyone else so the fun here is seeing how manages to bring about his own brand of justice because it is a foregone conclusion that he will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJ7S0TB6WQML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0I0694#wasThisHelpful","R2XJ7S0TB6WQML","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This rating and review will be revised after the hot weather sets in here 8 -12 weeks from now.  At this point I can only really comment on the unit's construction and ease of installation.When I unpacked this unit I was pleased with the quality of its construction - the unit is sturdy, solidly made with heavy materials.  This was reasonably easy to install, the directions were clear although much of the process was pretty intuitive.  My unit was installed in a location that already had a louver installed so all I needed to do was mount the fan and connect it to the power.  This did not take very long although giving an exact time estimate is not possible due to other issues unique to my installation coming up (shifting stored items out of the way to bring unit into attic, moving a light fixture out of installation area, and correcting poorly installed 40 year old wiring).Although the truly hot weather has not arrived yet I can detect a difference just during the moderately warm spring days.UPDATE The horribly hot, humid midwest summer weather has arrived and the second floor of my house is now habitable.  In the past there was a huge difference between the first and second floors of my house, now while there is still a difference it is not nearly as extreme.  So far the portable air conditioner that I had used in previous years to make the upstairs habitable is still in the garage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UU2NN2D3A9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P91TWK4#wasThisHelpful","R35UU2NN2D3A9K","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This long running series is focused on China Bayles, an attorney who has left the high pressure world of big city criminal law to open a herb shop in the little town of Pecan Springs, Texas.  Over the course of the series China has accumulated a group of friends, found romance, reconnected with long lost relatives, become a step mother and solved a whole lot of murders.  And herein lies the problem, one common with many long running series, particularly those in the cozy genre - when the main characters live in charming little communities just how many murders take place nearby?  The author has sent China off to nearby communities and further afield on road trips to solve this problem.  This time China has traveled a few hours away to visit her mother and step father over the Thanksgiving holiday.  Naturally some problems develop, some nefarious activities come to light and a couple of murders take place.  It is never in any doubt that China, aided by a friend Mack, rather than her husband McQuaid, will clear everything up on the end.As is typical with this genre the real attraction to this series is the on going story arcs of China, her family and friends.  This is particularly brought home in this case by the liner notes on the jacket cover that identify just who is slated for death and what crimes are being committed.  The suspense all lies in the subplots involving the characters' personal lives.  The real mysteries here are whether or not China's step father will recover enough to return to work and how will Mack's new romance work out.This series has always focused more on the subplots than the murder aspect but the author has usually woven a bit tighter story.  While it is necessary for any book from a series to rehash some of the background material in order to get a new reader up to speed or refresh the memory of a fan.  Unfortunately in this one the same material is supplied multiple times - we are told more than once that China and her mother have had a difficult relationship, or that China is now raising her dead half brother's daughter.Another issue with this novel is how the novel ends.  The crimes are solved but the various subplots are very blatantly left has cliffhangers - will Sam recover? will Leatha fall off the wagon? will Mack and Ethan find romance? will China need to move to Utopia to save Bittersweet Ranch?  And the biggest cliffhanger of all - will Albert abandon China and Pecan Grove for Mack and Utopia?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPG1F9EWEN0ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLZJ6#wasThisHelpful","RPG1F9EWEN0ZP","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit does do what it claims to do - charge devices quickly.  Normally delivering what is promised would rate at least a 4 star review but there are a couple of problems with this product.  In my opinion I should be able to use a product pretty much immediately upon wresting it out of the packaging.  No such luck with this, I needed to locate a cable to connect this device to each item I wanted to recharge.  This entailed going to a store and purchasing a cable that was about half as much as the charger itself cost.  The next issue was when I realized that the each outlet delivers a different amount of current, so even if I have two cables I cannot charge two phones at once.  To make this even more troublesome the markings to differentiate the two ports, and the ports themselves are located on the sides of the charger.  Don't plan on connecting something while zipping down the highway, this is not a simple process that can be easily accomplished without looking.On the plus side, it does do what it promises - charge my phone quickly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQUF2QVUHE60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNO0S12#wasThisHelpful","R2GQUF2QVUHE60","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As this tenth in the SEBASTIAN ST. CYR series begins it is late March 1813.  Sebastian and Hero are settling into life as parents when Sebastian is called upon to investigate the death of a member of the aristocracy.  The night time streets are dangerous places as every Londoner knows so why then had a wealthy landowner ventured out alone late at night, and what could he have possibly been doing at a popular trysting place in one of the seedier parts of town?  And why had whoever killed him bothered to cut off his head?Sebastian soon discovered that his inquiries into the matter brought some unwanted attention to his family, including that of an old enemy.  Despite the distractions of the case, or maybe because of them, Sebastian and Hero found themselves growing closer.  Would they be able to protect their little family from the dangers that threatened it?This is an interesting series, one that combines mildly challenging mysteries with well written characters to provide a glimpse into the turbulent early 1800's.

"This is the 6th in the LADY EMILY series of period romantic mystery novels.As this story begins it is early summer 1893, the London season is in full swing, parties are taking place every night and everyone who is anyone in London Society is obsessing over who is in and who is out, a status that can change overnight because of a whisper of scandal.Lady Emily and friends are enjoying themselves at a ball when her husband Colin Hargraves is called upon to run another errand for the Crown.  A fire has tragically taken the life of a young man, a member of Society who was due to be married in a few days time.  As Colin, and soon Emily aided by Ivy and Jeremy, begin to make inquires it becomes apparent that this tragedy is related to the mysterious  scarlet paint that has been splashed upon some very fashionable doorsteps over the past through weeks.  It has not taken long for the word to leak out that the red paint is being left as an indication of a shameful secret, and soon becomes the quickest way for a London socialite to become ostracized by 'polite' Society.This series is a fun read with the major attraction being the ongoing story line rather than the mystery aspect.  Because the series long story arc is so pronounced it is highly recommended to read this series in order, beginning with AND ONLY TO DECEIVE.  Fans of the AMELIA PEABODY or LADY JULIA series will probably enjoy this one as well.  As to which series is superior, each reader needs to decide for themselves, or simply enjoy them all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RSJWIR0JFE9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051OAP82#wasThisHelpful","R1RSJWIR0JFE9I","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 5th book in the Lady Emily series of period romantic mysteries.The novel is set in July 1892, a few weeks after the events of TEARS OF PEARL, the previous story.  Colin has brought Emily to his mother's home in Normandy to recover from the tragic end of their honeymoon.  Emily was still distraught, far from her usual feisty self but her talent for stumbling upon mystery and intrigue had returned.  While out for a quiet ride in the country she found not the peace and solitude she was seeking but instead the mutilated body of a young woman.  For once Emily would have preferred not to have been included in an investigation but soon she, Colin and Cecile were once again together trying to uncover the truth behind a violent death.  This time though they had a most unusual ally, the elusive gentleman thief, Sebastian.  Could it be that a bit of investigation would help Emily recover?This is a charming series of romantic mysteries that has a very strong overall story arc.  Those new to the series should begin with the first book in the series, AND ONLY TO DECEIVE then proceed in order.  The mystery element is really secondary to this on going story line.  Fans of Peters' Amelia Peabody would probably also enjoy these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18P9DM2IVMO1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312383819#wasThisHelpful","R18P9DM2IVMO1H","A3A6GXILVT9JNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6GXILVT9JNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth in the LADY EMILY series of romantic period mysteries.It is April of 1892, Colin and Emily have finally wed, much to the delight of their friends.  The pair decided that perhaps it would be prudent to allow those who were not so pleased with their impulsive elopement (their families and the Queen) a chance to calm down and decided to honeymoon off the beaten path in Turkey.  While their choice is delightfully romantic the newlyweds soon discover that in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire Constantinople is filled with intrigue and danger, a combination with which they are all too familiar.  Once again Emily and Colin are drawn into political schemes and charged with solving crimes.  Would this marriage last any longer than Emily's ill fated first one?There is a very strong overall story arc to this series so those new to Emily's adventures would do well to begin with AND ONLY TO DECEIVE, and then proceed in order.

"If you do makeup on others it's crucial to have a palette like this so that you are prepared to match any skin tone.  I do special effects makeup and this was a lifesaver this Halloween.

"This thing is ridiculously comfortable.  I didn't think I'd ever find a pillow I liked more then my solid memory foam pillow but this proved me wrong.

It's just soft and stays the perfect temperature.  I don't know how it does that exactly but I love the way it feels.  I'm a really really particular person when it comes to pillows and usually trying a new pillow means I don't sleep well for a few nights while I adjust.

"These work great for me. One end of the ear plug is round, and the other is not. It is easy to roll between my fingers. It does not expand too fast, so there is enough time to get it into my ear. It fits into my ear canal well, and tucks behind my tragus (which holds it in place). They do not hurt my ear.Be sure to follow the instructions and lift your ear with one hand, while inserting the plug with the other hand. You know if you got it completely in your ear, if you can feel it touching your ear drum (usually you'll get a slight sensation in your throat when it touches your ear drum).If I wake up in the middle of the night, I sometimes remove them. I place them in a small container when not in use. They last a long time (a month or longer for one pair). I use them as needed...not every night.If it is a warm summer night, and If the neighbors are talking outside or people are playing (basketball) outside, then these ear plugs stop the sounds completely. Wonderful.It would be even better if people were considerate to those around them, but that's just not the world we live in.  So, these ear plugs are the answer. I paid 6 bucks.

"I paid 8 bucks.  The fan I received was 0.28A / NIDEC with copper bottom including thermal paste on the bottom disk.My original fan was an Intel E97378-001. It was 0.60A / Delta. Every couple of months, it would intermittently stop or run slowly at PC startup, and this prevented my PC from booting; when turned-on, my PC would stop at the initial boot screen, and it would display ""CPU fan error"".  My original fan only lasted 3 years before it started giving me problems.It seems there are several varieties of this fan all using the same part # of E97378-001.  Here are the ones that I noticed: 0.17A / Foxconn, 0.60A / Delta, and 0.28A / NIDEC.The heat sink is aluminum (the large circle of silver fins under the fan itself), but the bottom small disk/circle of the heat sink may be either aluminum or copper (depends on who you buy it from); this is the part that rests on top of the CPU; it touches the CPU.  Copper does a better job of conducting heat from the CPU.  It's best to look at the photos; if there are no photos of the bottom, ask the seller to check before buying.Also, some fans come with thermal paste already placed on the bottom of the heat sink (it looks like 3 gray bars on the bottom).  If you fan doesn't come with thermal paste on it, then you need to buy it separately.The photos on Amazon may not reflect what you actually get from a seller.  If you really want to know what you are buying before you buy it, then pick a seller and email the seller before buying; ask them 3 things:1) What is the amp rating?2) Is the bottom disk copper or aluminum?3) Is thermal paste included on the bottom disk?I replaced my 0.60A fan with a 0.28A fan, and my PC boots fine now.  Looking at the BIOS settings/status, the CPU fan runs at 980-1020 RPM when the PC is first turned-on.  I'm not sure that the amp rating has much meaning for these fans; if it did, then I would think that Intel would have created different part numbers for each one.Since my original 0.60A / Delta fan only lasted 3 years, I wanted to try a different one this time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X02YD5EL1RW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0NWHRC#wasThisHelpful","R1X02YD5EL1RW5","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I paid 8 bucks.  The fan I received was 0.28A / NIDEC with copper bottom including thermal paste on the bottom disk.My original fan was an Intel E97378-001. It was 0.60A / Delta. Every couple of months, it would intermittently stop or run slowly at PC startup, and this prevented my PC from booting; when turned-on, my PC would stop at the initial boot screen, and it would display ""CPU fan error"".  My original fan only lasted 3 years before it started giving me problems.It seems there are several varieties of this fan all using the same part # of E97378-001.  Here are the ones that I noticed: 0.17A / Foxconn, 0.60A / Delta, and 0.28A / NIDEC.The heat sink is aluminum (the large circle of silver fins under the fan itself), but the bottom small disk/circle of the heat sink may be either aluminum or copper (depends on who you buy it from); this is the part that rests on top of the CPU; it touches the CPU.  Copper does a better job of conducting heat from the CPU.

It spans the full length of the Bataan incident (fighting, surrender, death march, captivity experiences, rescue, homecoming).  They did a good job of compiling footage about the Bataan Rescue, including veteran interviews.  They also interviewed Filipino guerrilla fighters.Being only an hour long, there are no ""slow parts""...and there is no ""filler"" footage here, which is good.

"The seller was Amazon.

I also ran memtest86 and there were no memory errors.I previously purchased Kingston HyperX FURY 8GB 1866MHz DDR3 CL10 DIMM - Black (HX318C10FB/8), which the Kingston website said was compatible with my motherboard.

"Excellent acting. Believable story-line. Decent special effects. No gore. Violence is limited to a few dogfights.There is some in-air action with German planes and British planes fighting each other. However, a good deal of the movie takes place back at the base...when the pilots return from a mission.There is definitely a psychological part to war, and this movie presents that very well. If you are able to relate to the characters and what they are going through, then the story will likely cause you to shed a few tears.Did you like this movie?

"The seller was GAMESPlus-Woodlands. I paid 18 bucks including shipping in Fall 2012.I rented war movies from Netflix for a couple of years, and finally ran across Band of Brothers.  It is one of the best WWII movies.  The down-to-earth nature and realism of the production is excellent.  Sounds, sights, dialogue, actors, location, props, etc. are all right on the mark.  Amazing.  It is an excellent way to learn and understand some of what these men experienced.Nearly every episode brought me to tears at one point or another.  Other times, some stuff made me angry; some made me laugh.  Those are signs of a very good movie...a movie that is engaging...one that pulls you in, puts you there, and allows you to experience a little of what the men experienced.  It can be difficult to watch at times.Other descriptions for this series: realistic battle scenes, camaraderie among the men, attention to detail, great acting, bonus disk with veteran interviews.I could recount many scenes that had a lot of impact on me, but that would make this review very long...so I won't do that.Some things I didn't like:Foul language--the degree of profanity was typical of Vietnam and today, not WWII; while not excessive, the language was not representative of the time.  Extensive hand signals were not used by WWII paratroopers.  A few other historical inaccuracies...search the internet, if you're curious. The primary military adviser (Captain Dale Dye, USMC, Retired) served in the Vietnam War; this helps explain the overuse of foul language and hand signals.This boxed set includes 6 DVDs: 10 episodes on 5 DVDs plus an extra DVD with special/bonus features.  Each episode is about an hour long.I highly recommend this series.

Unless you hit those keys when you are told to do so and at precisely the right angle, you cannot win the fight. This is also known as a QTE (quick time event).* During each boss fight, doors close around you; once you defeat the boss, doors open again.* Every boss battle is the same: Roll around and shoot the orange spots...over and over again until the boss is dead.* Checkpoint saves* Keyboard configuration (until you change it)This game is best played on Easy difficult in order to make the annoying boss fights easier and quicker to get through.The game has a decent story, even though the story moves a bit slowly at times.

"The Moen 7560BL Extensa One-Handle Low Arc Pullout Matte Black Kitchen Faucet was installed while my home was being built. I've been using it since January 2006 with no problems.In 2014, the spout began to leak at the top and down the flexible tubing on the inside when I pressed the spray button on top.  I don't use the spray feature much, and when I do use it, I usually pull the spout from the base to wash-off items in the sink.  The leak was noticeable when I pressed the spray button, but the leak wasn't excessive.The fact that some water was leaking down the flexible pipe to the base of the cabinet below was not good, so I began looking into a new faucet.  New faucets (from almost any reputable manufacturer) are not cheap.  Thankfully, I ran across some reviews about warranties, and then remembered that the Moen came with a lifetime warranty.  In Fall 2014, I called Moen and within 3 days I received a new spout via FedEx at no charge.  It was easy to install, and it works great.I did not have a receipt for the original faucet, because it was part of new construction. I did register my faucet on the Moen website before I called them.  They did not give me any problems. I was surprised that they were so quick to honor their warranty.  My past experience with other companies and their warranties has been poor; there always seems to be a reason to say ""no"".  Moen was not like that.The new spout is made of plastic, is much lighter than the old spout, and the internal design is a bit different.

"This faucet was installed while my home was being built. I selected it at a local plumbing supply store during the building process.  It is a large faucet, which is what I wanted for the single bowl kitchen sink. I was familiar with the Moen name, it looked good, had the features I wanted, and it came with a lifetime warranty.I was interested in a sleek, single handle faucet for ease of use when adjusting water temperature.  It's also easy to turn-on when your hands are dirty or full. I can use my fingers, wrist, or arm to lift the lever.The pull-out faucet works well.  It pulls-out far enough, and it returns to its base.  It is not like a tape measure, which retracts by itself.  You have to guide the flexible pipe and spout back into the faucet base.  I had a faucet similar to this in my prior home, so I know how they work.  And it works fine, in my opinion.In 2014, the spout began to leak at the top and down the flexible tubing on the inside when I pressed the spray button on top.  I don't use the spray feature much, and when I do use it, I usually pull the spout from the base to wash-off items in the sink.  The leak was noticeable when I pressed the spray button, but the leak wasn't excessive.The fact that some water was leaking down the flexible pipe to the base of the cabinet below was not good, so I began looking into a new faucet.  New faucets (from almost any reputable manufacturer) are not cheap.  Thankfully, I ran across some reviews about warranties, and then remembered that the Moen came with a lifetime warranty.  In Fall 2014, I called Moen and within 3 days I received a new spout via FedEx at no charge.  It was easy to install, and it works great. The replacement spout is also available on Amazon: Moen 136829BL Pull-Out Spout.I did not have a receipt for the original faucet, because it was part of new construction. I did register my faucet on the Moen website before I called them.  They did not give me any problems. I was surprised that they were so quick to honor their warranty.  My past experience with other companies and their warranties has been poor; there always seems to be a reason to say ""no"".  Moen was not like that.The new spout is made of plastic, is much lighter than the old spout, and the internal design is a bit different.

"The seller was Amazon Warehouse Deals. I paid 120 bucks including shipping. The item was marked ""used--very good"".There were some signs of prior use (scuffs on/under the front bumper, and some dust), but I would agree that the truck was in ""very good"" condition.  It looks like someone may have purchased it, tried it out,  didn't like it, and returned it to Amazon. All of the original items were there.I tried a few test runs.  The truck works well.  Forward, reverse, turning all work well.  The truck appears well made. The handheld remote control radio is well designed and responsive. I like that the radio and the truck receiver are already bound to each other. This truck is ready to run...just like it says; insert/charge batteries and go!As other folks  have noted, the receiver on the truck does not appear to be waterproof. On the Redcat Racing website, it says the receiver is ""splashproof"".Under the hood, there seems to be a good balance of metal versus plastic parts. Unless you plan to use this truck on very tough terrain or do stunts with it, it looks like it should hold-up well.I also like that you can purchase upgrades and replacement parts online...either at the Redcat Racing website, or at a dealer website, or on Amazon or eBay. To find a dealer in your area, visit the Redcat Racing website and click on ""Find a Dealer"".Based on another Amazon reviewer's suggestion, I replaced the stock plastic spur gear with a metal one: Redcat Racing 64T Steel Spur Gear 11184. It took a little doing, but it wasn't too tough. You'll need a Phillips screwdriver, a Flathead screwdriver (for the E clip), and a 2mm hex wrench (for the drive cup).While removing screws to install the metal spur gear, I noticed that there are at least 3 types of screw lengths and threads (even for screws on the under carriage).  So, if you do maintenance on it, I recommend grouping the screws together, so you know where they came from (when it comes time to reinstall them).I also adjusted the suspension on the front and rear, so that the truck will bottom-out if it hits the ground real hard. To hear why this is important, visit youtube and search for qIO6KwVOM4Y. Youtube user ramrod340x does a good job of explaining and showing how to adjust the suspension.  It's also easy to do.It came with a 7.2v 2000mAh battery.  I upgraded the battery to a Redcat Racing HX-3800MH-B 3800 Ni-MH Battery-7.2V with Banana Connector.I purchased some Duratrax Kwik Trak Racing Cones (6-Piece).I purchased a better charger, since the ""travel charger"" that was included with the truck seemed cheap and other reviewers complained that it didn't last long.  Here is the better charger: Tenergy Universal Smart Charger for NiMH/NiCd Battery Packs (6V - 12V). The Tenergy charger does NOT come with banana connectors, so I also had to buy this: Redcat Racing ST-TAMFTO4B Version 4.0 Female Tamiya to Banana Adapter.I also purchased a Tactic 4-Cell AA Battery Holder with Futaba J Connector. The receiver and controller that come with a new truck are already bound together. The only reason to use this item is to bind a different/replacement receiver or hand-held controller. During the bind process, this battery pack should be plugged into the VCC slot on the receiver. For additional instructions on how to bind a receiver and controller, see the quick start guide in the first comment to this review.Minus 1 star because the owners manual and instructions are poor. There is nothing to tell me what the controls on the handheld remote do (or what the abbreviations mean). Although I don't need to bind the radio to the receiver, there are no instructions on how to do that. What are the extra items for? (5-inch tube--for antenna, shock spring spacers, bind plug/control) And there is no explanation of how to charge the battery (e.g., how long? what does the LED indicator on the charger mean? etc.). How do you turn-on the truck? The on/off switch is somewhat hidden and black in color. Simple stuff, unless you are new to RC. I can usually figure out stuff on my own, or I check online; but when I give this as a gift to someone who is new to RC, then I have to provide additional help (or write-up my own documentation).For people who are new to RC, or who are giving this truck to someone else as a gift...I created my own quick start guide using OpenOffice Writer. The guide includes instructions that are specific to my gift, so not everything is applicable to a brand new truck. For example, I purchased extra batteries, a quality charger, extra body clips, and 4-cell AA battery pack in case the owner wants to bind a different receiver/controller to the truck.  To download my quick start guide, see the first comment to this review.  After downloading it, you can use OpenOffice to change it to meet your needs.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  This is a Christmas gift for a boy age 11.The truck also comes in red:Redcat Racing Electric Volcano EPX Truck, Red","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTLWE1C5RCYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEP8YN4#wasThisHelpful","RWTLWE1C5RCYY","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The seller was Bike Towne. I paid about 10 bucks including shipping.My old chain was still okay, but after almost 20 years of casual biking, I decided it was time to change it.  I measured the old chain to determine how much it may have stretched; thankfully, it hadn't stretched (or at least it didn't stretch enough to be noticeable to me). To remove the old chain, I just broke it with pliers.The new KMC chain was lightly oiled.  It was longer than my original chain; a coworker who has bike tools was kind enough to shorten it for me; it was easy for him to remove the excess chain with the tool he had.The new chain was very easy to install. I threaded it onto the cassette and the rear derailleurs, and then attached the master link. The master link fit so easily that I did not have to step on the pedal to lock it into place. My mountain bike is a 21 speed (7 gears in the back, 3 in the front).Time will tell if the chain will hold-up as well as my prior chain.

"The seller was GRPerks. I paid about 16 bucks including shipping.I had 2 old folding hex sets, but they were only SAE/inches and they only had 8-9 wrenches per set (and most of the sizes were the same between the two of them).I wanted a set that had both SAE and metric, and a set that had most sizes...at a reasonable price.  This set fits the bill.  The quality is good too.So far, I have used the 2mm wrench to successfully remove a nut that was way too tight.  I had to put quite a bit of pressure on the 2mm wrench, but thankfully it did not bend.  It also fit the nut perfectly.The other wrenches appear to be shaped/cut well too.  The case is heavy duty and very handy; the wrenches stay in their slots.I am pleased with my purchase.  And because there is a good selection of sizes for both SAE and metric, I don't think I'll need to buy another hex set!

"The seller was Amazon. I paid 48 bucks for each tire including shipping.  I purchased 2 tires.I purchased this tire along with two other items...to upgrade my old bike.  My goal was to make my tires as flat-free as possible. This tire has ""smartguard"", which is about 5mm thick; add that to the  rubber that is above and below the smartguard, and that means there is about 8-9mm between the road and the tube.There are goathead weeds in my area, and they flatten tires real fast.  I don't rely on this tire as my only defense.  I also purchased a quality tire liner: Mr. Tuffy Bicycle Tire Liner.  And I purchased quality tubes: 2 x Schwalbe Inner Tubes - 26"" x 1.50 to 2.50 - Schrader/Auto Valve - PAIR - FREE VALVE CAP UPGRADE [No. AV13].Between the tire and the tire liner, there is about 10-11mm of barrier between my tube and the road.  That's enough to keep the goat heads out.Slime doesn't work for me--it just clogs the tube value; and after a while, Slime dries and clumps inside the tube, making it useless.The tire was easy to install.

"The seller was Skyscape Cycle Co. I paid 20 bucks including shipping.Things I like about these tubes:* thick rubber* tall valve (about 1.5 inches tall)* valve nut* hold air well* good connection between value and tubeThe valve nut is good, because it keeps the value secure on the rim; the nut prevents the valve from pushing back into the rim/tube when I place the pump on the value.The tubes came with clear plastic valve caps.  However, the seller included 2 metal value caps for free, and they fit just fine...very nice.When installing a tube, I inflated the tube to a low PSI (enough so it would hold its shape), and then placed it between the rim and tire.

"The seller was Amazon. I paid 229 bucks. I purchased the set 9 months ago.The set arrived well packaged; nothing was damaged; everything looked good.My prior cookware set was a cheap $40 non-stick set. It worked fine for many years. However, as with all non-stick surfaces, the non-stick part wears-off over time (no matter how careful I am). So, this time, I wanted a cookware set that would NOT wear-out over time.  After researching my options (ceramic, anodized, cast iron, cooper, etc.), I decided on stainless steel.After researching several stainless steels brands, I settled on this Cuisinart set.  There is a cheaper version of this Cuisinart set, but it got bad reviews, because it was too thin.I am very pleased with the weight of this set. It has worked very well for me.I did have to change my cooking habits, but that's fine.  Here is what I changed:1) Use lower heat2) Preheat the cookware3) Use oil when cookingAs long as I follow the above 3 habits, I don't have a problem with sticking.There is a way to season stainless steel cookware; do an internet search to find it.  I tried it once for one of the pans, and it worked. But I don't use my pans regularly enough to season them. I usually cook enough of a dish to last me 2 weeks.Depending on how careful you are (and how thorough you are with cleaning), the cookware may discolor over time.  The instructions provide a way to clean the pans when they become soiled (boiling water for several minutes with a certain amount of dishwasher detergent). There is also a cleaner that you can buy (like bar keepers friend). Discoloring of the bottom (inside or outside) does not impair cooking ability.I also like the fact that scratches don't impair cooking ability. And no more non-stick surface to erode over time.  Very nice.  The set is dishwasher and oven safe.I am pleased with my purchase. As long as I don't accidentally leave a piece on a hot stove, it should last me for the rest of my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGVU4VFFSFGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JXPS6U#wasThisHelpful","R2GGVU4VFFSFGY","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this from Walmart (ordered online and shipped to my local store for free).  I paid 19 bucks.The plastic is tough and thick.My washer is 25.5"" deep by 27"" wide.  I installed it so the 32"" side was front-to-back, so there were several extra inches of drip pan in the back (to catch any potential drips from the hoses where they connect to the washer).Regarding width, after installing, there is still about 1"" of extra room on one side and 1.25"" on the other side.I was able to install it by myself.  I pulled the washer forward, then tilted it forward and placed some bricks in the back left corner under the washer.  Then I tilted the washer back toward the wall, and slid the drain pan underneath.  Then I tilted the washer forward and worked it toward me (back/forth slowly).  Then I removed the bricks.  Finally, I slid the washer (now fully on the pan) into place and made some minor adjustments to center it.I did not install the PVC pipe fitting.  My purpose for the drip pan is to catch a slow drip, if one develops in the future.  I turn-off the water spigots in the wall after I use the washer, so that keeps pressure off the hoses unless I'm actively using the machine.The walls of the drip pan are not straight up/down; the sides/corners are rounded and they do flare a little.  So, inside measurements are about 29"" wide by 31"" deepI'm very pleased with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZSBADIO8W7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PS8J64#wasThisHelpful","R1AZSBADIO8W7D","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The seller was Amazon.  I paid 109 bucks.This replaces a Sears Craftsman gas mower 6.5 horsepower (mulching or bag); I mulch my lawn.I narrowed my search to the following push reel mowers:American Lawn Mower 1815-18 18-InchGreat States 815-18 18-Inch DeluxeThese 2 mowers are identical, except for their name, model #, color, etc.They are made by the same company (American Lawn Mower).Maximum cutting height is 2.75 inches.Made in China.Fiskars 17-Inch StaySharp (6208)Fiskars 17-Inch StaySharp Plus (6207)Fiskars 18-Inch StaySharp Max (6201)Fiskars was too expensive.Maximum cutting height is 3.5 inches for the 6208, and 4 inches for the others.Parts are not available online, but available under warranty if you call Fiskars.The ""max"" model has an internal chain, which can wear over time.Made in China.McLane 17-PH-7 17-Inch 7-Blade Front-ThrowMcLane was too expensive.Maximum cutting height is 2.5 inches.Made in the USA.Some key features of the Scotts 2000-20:* Maximum cutting height is 3 inches.* 20-inch blade.* Width measured from wheel-to-wheel (outer edge) is 26.5 inches.* Parts are available online from American Lawn Mower at reasonable price.* Shipping for parts is also reasonable.* For online manual and parts, visit www reelin dot com* Made for Scotts by the American Lawn Mower Company.* Made in China.Other notes about my yard and the Scotts 2000-20:All parts are metal except for the wheels, wing nuts knobs, and wheel gears.  The wheel tires are rubber, and the wheel rims are plastic.  The wing nuts knobs are plastic, but there is a metal nut inside; this was no different than my Craftsman.  The wheel gears (inside each large wheel) are plastic, but it is a thick/sturdy plastic.I like the 2 small wheels on the back (instead of rollers, which some reel mowers use).  The handle is sturdy (it does not flex when I push the mower).My grass type is a blend of Kentucky Bluegrass and Perennial Rye; I live in the northwest USA.  I keep my grass ""high"" all season.  So, with the Scotts, I have the mower set to 3 inches (the maximum cutting height).  I keep my lawn weeded, so I am mowing grass...not weeds.  I mow once a week.  I try not to overwater, and I use a fall fertilizer the entire season (19-4-4); this helps keep the lawn healthy, but prevents it from growing too quickly).My front lawn is about 600 square feet, and my back lawn is about 800 square feet.  It takes me less than 30 minutes to do my entire lawn, which is about the same as my gas mower.  In most cases, I can mow my lawn in one pass.Most of my lawn is bordered by pavement or by cobble stones, so that makes it easy to edge (I straddle the mower over the lawn/pavement and over the lawn/cobble stones).I do have trees and shrubs in the front yard and several trees in the back yard...all bordered by cobble stone.  The border around the trees and shrubs is circular.  It's easy to mow around the circle.  The Honey Locust trees sometimes drop small, thin twigs; the mower grids them just fine.My yard has corners, nooks, smaller strips, circular areas, etc.  I have no problem maneuvering the Scotts around my yard.When I first received the Scotts, I thought the blades were too tight, so I loosened them (and tested them by slicing pieces of paper with the blades).  The adjustment was easy to do; a small wrench is included with the mower (or you can use your own wrench or a large flathead screw driver).Sharpening the cutting bar (blade) is easy to do (i.e., backlapping).  Remove both wheels, reverse both gears, replace the wheels, place grinding compound on the reel blades, run the mower up/down your driveway several times, wipe off the excess compound, remove both wheels, reverse both gears, replace the wheels, done.  Here is some valve grinding compound available on Amazon: Permatex 80037 Valve Grinding Compound, 3 oz...about 5 bucks.Alternately, you could buy the American Lawn Mower SK-1 Reel Mower Sharpening Kit, but why pay extra for it?A Scotts owner posted a video showing how to maintain the mower, including how to disassemble and reassemble the Scotts; go to YouTube and search for: oEePHETPZhEI'm very pleased with my purchase.I'm happy to sell my gas mower; things I won't miss about my gas mower: gas, oil, air filter, spark plug, noise, fumes, changing the oil, winterizing it, sharpening the mulching blade (couldn't do that myself), the smoke when I first ran it at the beginning of each season.keyword: maintenance, measurement, square footage, size","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MI98KQDUNDSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RA3E#wasThisHelpful","R3MI98KQDUNDSI","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DVD started with war footage.  There was no attempt at the history of Korea (you hear about the 38th parallel, but no history behind it).  What was Korea like before the war?  I don't know.  I just know that the Commies came from the north, and the United Nations came from the South, and there was a war in Korea.  Disappointing.The footage is mostly black-and-white.  The sound/narration is fine, but the veteran interviews are muffled.  There are rudimentary maps/diagrams...nothing helpful.The narrator exaggerated several times, which led me to doubt other things he said.  For example, ""the soldiers fought for every step of ground"".  And while saying that, they showed a bunch of soldiers walking down a road.  They certainly weren't fighting for every step.The narrator was professional, but the narration was not very informative.  Sometimes the narration did not match the footage.  Most of the time, the footage was random, short war clips strung together.  What was actually happening in the footage?  I don't know.  The narrator just kept telling the Korean War story...sometimes without regard to the footage itself.I am still looking for a well-round documentary about the Korean War.  I had the same problem while looking for a decent documentary about the Vietnam War, but I eventually found this excellent documentary: Vietnam - A Television History.

"The seller was Amazon. I paid 50 bucks.I'm using the G600 on a PC with Windows XP Home SP3; the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) version is 8.45.88.  The firmware version is 77.02.17.  I'm also using the G600 on a PC with Windows 10 Technical Preview with LGS version 8.57.145.Several years ago, I switched from a regular 3-button mouse to a Logitech G700. It took some time to get used to the G700, but I liked the G700 very much. The same is true for the switch from G700 to G600. It takes a little time to get used to it, but it is worth it.I do like lots of buttons on my mouse for flexibility in Windows applications, browser, and games.  I don't always use every button, but I have the flexibility to do so.WEIGHTThe G700 with battery (can't run it without the battery installed) weighs 6 ounces.  The G600 weighs 5 ounces.  I've heard some people complain about how heavy the G600 is, but I don't have any problem with the weight, because my prior mouse was a G700 (which is 1 ounce heavier).SIZEI measured both mice across the top over the scroll wheel area. The G700 measures 6 centimeters; and the G600 measures 7 cm.  Not much difference, considering the G600 adds a third button along the right side.SCROLL WHEELBoth mice have a tilt scroll wheel with 3 buttons built in (middle click, left tilt, right tilt). I like the wheel tilt feature very much. The G700 wheel is metallic on its sides and rubber down its middle; you can set it to have smooth rolling or notched. The G600 is all rubber; you can not set it to smooth rolling...it's notched and that's it. I like notched, so it is not a problem for me.BUTTON CLICKSWhen clicked/pressed, the tactical feel of the G9-G20 buttons (the 12 buttons on the left side) on the G600 is like the G11 button on the G700.  The G600 G7-G8 buttons sound/feel like the G700 G9 button.  The left, middle, right, scroll tilt buttons on the G600 feel the same as their counterparts on the G700. I don't have to press G600 thumb buttons as hard (compared to G700), and the thumb buttons on the G600 take less pressure to actuate.G-SHIFT BUTTONI like this button a lot. It doubles the function of all mouse buttons except left click, right click, G8, and the G-Shift button itself.  So, the mouse has 20 buttons, and with the G-Shift, the mouse now has 36 button options.  Lots of flexibility.  Very nice.  If you reassign left click to another button, then you can use the left click button with G-Shift (same for right click).  For G8, if you use it with the G-Shift, then you can assign 2 functions to it, but you lose the mode switching ability for that profile.If you don't like the G-Shift button, then you can unassign it, and assign another function to that button.  You can always get it back by dragging/dropping the G-Shift function from the commands list/menu to the button.GRIPWith my fingers together, my hand measures about 8.25 inches around...just below the knuckles, which makes my glove size a medium. The G600 feels very nice to me. Because it glides so easily, and because of its shape, I find that I don't have to grip it as hard as the G700...and that's easier on my hand.On the thumb side of the mouse...The mouse glides very well. I can rest my thumb on the side buttons and move the mouse around easily without actually pressing the side buttons. Sometimes I rest my thumb just beyond or below the G9 button. Either works well for me...depends on what I am using the mouse for.On the ring/pinky finger side of the mouse...This took a little getting used to, but it works well. Again, two choices: If I am not using the G-shift button, then I can rest my ring finger along the side of the button. However, I do like the G-shift button, so I rest my ring finger on top of it. My pinky finger grips the mouse on the right side. Since the mouse is lighter (compared to the G700), using my pinky finger to grip and help with movement is not a problem for me. The bottom edge of this side of the mouse is rubber, which helps to grip it. Does your pinky hurt? Give it a chance. Your muscles will adjust.Depends on how you use your mouse...In games, instead of using the traditional W-S-A-D keys for movement, I use mouse buttons. I started doing this with the G700, using the wheel tilt for left/right, G7 forward, G6 back, G7 plus G5 forward sprint/run. This makes movement much more natural in my opinion.  For the G600, it's similar: wheel tilt for left/right, G11 forward, G20 back, G11 plus G10 forward sprint/run. Since I am usually walking or running forward, I am gripping the mouse with my thumb most of the time. When not gripping the mouse in this way, I grip it with the area of my palm below my thumb (or just beyond the G9 button). This works well for me.TRACKING, POLLING/REPORT RATE, DPIFor the G700, I used 1000 DPI and 250 for report rate.  For the G600, I am using the same settings. The mouse tracks very well for me; this is probably a combination of mouse quality and PC configuration.LOGITECH GAMING SOFTWARE (LGS)I used this same software for my G700, so it is nothing new to me. Same software, except the screens are different in order to support the additional/different features of the G600. I recommend using ""automatic game detection"", not on-board memory (this setting is on the home page of the LGS; it's a toggle switch). While using the G700, I switched from Setpoint software to LGS, and I noticed that onboard memory did not work well (it was fine with Setpoint, just not LGS). For the G600, I didn't even try on-board memory, since ""automatic game detection"" works so well for me.MODES VS. PROFILESI use automatic game detection for both G700 and G600, which means unlimited profiles and no hassles with profile switching...works well for me.  For the G600, there are also modes.  So, for each profile, you can have up to 3 modes...each mode has its own button configuration. Here is how this is helpful to me... Game #1: The main character has two movement options: human, which is used most of the time; mechanized armor/tank, which is used occasionally. The controls are different for each. So, I have 1 profile for the game with 2 modes (one for the human, one for the armor/tank). Press the mode switch button (G8 or whatever you want to set it to) and I can easily switch between human and armor/tank settings.  Very nice.CORDThe G700 cord is rubber coated. The G600 cord is less thick and braided nylon. Both work fine. The G700 cord showed no signs of wear after 3+ years of use.  Wait and see with the G600 cord.LIGHTSThe G700 has 3 lights on the side to indicate what profile you are using (if you use onboard profiles, which I don't). The G600 is a regular Christmas tree...each of the G9-G20 buttons are backlit, and there are lots of color and lighting options. Very nice, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, so I disabled the lighting effect.SOME GOTCHASGOTCHA #1Converting profiles from the G700 to the G600.  These 2 mice have different buttons, so don't expect to plug-and-play. Although you can see the G700 profiles in the LGS when the G600 is plugged in, you cannot use the G700 profile successfully unless you remap all keys to the G600. It's easy to do. All of the commands associated with a profile are listed in the commands menu area in LGS (on the left side of the screen). Drag and drop the commands from the commands menu to the G600 buttons and you're ready to go.  If you are permanently switching from G700 to G600, remapping existing profiles is fine. If you plan to use both mice interchangeably, then rename the G700 profiles to have G700 in the name, and copy/save-as the G700 profiles to G600 profiles and do the remapping; so, you'll have 2 sets of profiles...one for G700 and one for G600.GOTCHA #2Setting or assigning commands to the normal and G-shift buttons. ""Normal"" means the normal use of a button without using the G-shift button. ALWAYS drag and drop commands from the command menu on the left side of the ""customize buttons"" screen to the mouse button on the right side of the screen. NEVER use the little drop down menu for each button to edit commands; it's okay to use the drop down menu to unassign, use generic, use default. If you don't follow this advice, then when you attempt to edit commands for G-shift buttons, you will overwrite the normal button assignment with the G-shift assignment. It's just a quirky software thing. To create new commands, use the plus sign next to the word ""Commands"".GOTCHA #3By default, the mouse wheel tilt buttons are assigned to back and forward; and this works great when working with Windows applications and browsers.  However, some people like me had the problem of the G600 going back twice or going forward two times when only clicking the tilt button once (i.e., double click problem). In Windows XP, the solution is to go to Control Panel, System, Hardware tab, Device Manager button, expand Mouse, double-click each ""HID-compatible mouse"" device to find the one that says ""on Logitech gaming Virtual Mouse"", and then right click that device and disable it. This solved the problem.keywords: gotchyas, bugs, buggy, problems, answers, fixes, solutions, G700s, hurts, painfulSUMMARYI am very happy with the G600, but I haven't used it for very long.  I hope to get many years of use out of it.  I plan to update this review as needed, if I experience problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JHXA7N3VHZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086UK7IQ#wasThisHelpful","R11JHXA7N3VHZA","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This documentary describes lots of history about how the national park system came into being (and some history of certain individual parks), but it does NOT provide much detail about any particular park (and that was disappointing).

The lack of focus on various topics and parks is annoying. For example, Hetch Hetchy is discussed several times on different DVDs, instead of discussing the entire story in one episode. Another example is the description of Rockefeller buying-up land in Jackson.

"I have used the following brands (or their generics): Gum, and Johnson & Johnson Reach.  Oral-B Glide floss (or a similar store brand/generic version) is the best.

So, my gums don't bleed, the floss does not get stuck/break in my teeth, it does not fray, and I can spend time actually FLOSSING (i.e., gently working the floss back/forth between my teeth to remove debris).

For some of my tightly spaced teeth, I hate having to put so much pressure on the floss to get it between my teeth...then as it gets forced between my teeth, it slices into my gums, and that hurts and causes bleeding.

In comparison, Gum was 3.50 for 200 yards, Johnson & Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 50 yards, and the generic version of Johnson & Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 100 yards.

"I have used the following brands (or their generics): Gum, and Johnson & Johnson Reach.  Oral-B Glide floss (or a similar store brand/generic version) is the best.  It is a ribbon that slides/glides easily between my teeth.  Some of my lower teeth are very close together, but Glide does the job on those teeth perfectly.  So, my gums don't bleed, the floss does not get stuck/break in my teeth, it does not fray, and I can spend time actually FLOSSING (i.e., gently working the floss back/forth between my teeth to remove debris).  Since it does not fray or break, I end up using less floss.  Now I enjoy flossing!THE COMPETITIONGum floss was thin.  It not only frayed quickly, but broken in my teeth right away.  I tried regular Gum floss, not the butter-weave version.  The labeling on both versions of Gum floss make the same claims: strong, slides easily between tightly spaced teeth.  Not true...not for me.Johnson & Johnson Reach is a thicker floss, it was difficult to get between some of my teeth, it also frayed after flossing a few teeth; and when it broke, it was uncomfortable and difficult to remove from between my teeth.  I have used Johnson & Johnson Reach in the past, because it was cheap.  However, I do NOT like it.  It did not encourage me to floss.  For some of my tightly spaced teeth, I hate having to put so much pressure on the floss to get it between my teeth...then as it gets forced between my teeth, it slices into my gums, and that hurts and causes bleeding.  And when I pull the floss back out, it feels like my tooth might come out with the floss (only applies to my tightly spaced teeth).PRICEFor Glide floss, I am able to purchase the Equate store brand (generic) at Wal-Mart; it sells for about 4 bucks for a two-pack; each item in the pack is 40m (43.7 yards) for a total of 80m (87.5 yards) for the whole pack.  In comparison, Gum was 3.50 for 200 yards, Johnson & Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 50 yards, and the generic version of Johnson & Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 100 yards.  In comparison to the other brands of floss, Glide is expensive.However, I don't need to use as much Glide, because it doesn't break or fray (and because it slides easier between my teeth, which means I don't need to have a death grip on the floss itself).  Instead of needing about 18 inches of floss tightly wrapped around the fingers of both hands, about 12 inches of Glide works just fine for me.  So, using 1 foot per day at 87.5 yards means that one two-pack should last me almost 9 months.

"First, the good stuff...The bonus feature!  If you don't like the movie, don't just turn it off.  Watch the bonus feature.  It is about the battles of Verdun and Somme.  The footage is black-and-white.  The narrator does a good job.  The music is lousy at times, but most of it is okay for an old documentary. It is produced by CBS News, and it is 47 minutes long.  It is informative and has lots of WWI footage.Second, the bad stuff...The movie itself!  The movie is slow moving. I kept waiting for something to happen. There was only 3 minutes of fighting, which showed the soldier's running across a field and being gunned down; then the movie ends.  Not much fighting.  This movie is 1 hour 36 minutes long, but only the last 3 minutes involved fighting; the rest of the time was trench drama (i.e., conversations among the soldiers).American audiences may find the thick British accents and British colloquialisms hard to follow.This movie is NOT for kids. This film is not rated, but it would carry an ""R"" rating. There is liberal use of the f-bomb through the entire movie, adult humor, two disturbing war scenes/images (gore) plus the last 3 minutes, and one scene where soldiers are viewing a topless photo. The excessive foul language seemed out of place for the era; the director used late 20th century swearing in an early 20th century setting; it's not historically accurate.The movie lacks reality.  Pretty boys in a trench discussing inane crap.  All cleaner than a whistle. The trench was immaculate. Did you get a load of the battlefield above the trench? It looked like a farm yard in Yorkshire or something. Very little reality in this movie, and that was disappointing.Remember to watch the bonus feature!Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31C1CR8ZJ0UMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VK74A4#wasThisHelpful","R31C1CR8ZJ0UMM","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary. The modern day interviews/recollections of WWII German military men were very interesting and informative. The war footage was also exceptional (mostly black and white).The narrator was professional; and when there was music, it was appropriate.DVD episodes include:* Blitzkrieg* Luftwaffe* Waffen SS* U Boats* Russia - The Unholy War* Defending BerlinEach episode is about 50 minutes long (maybe 45 minutes, if you exclude the beginning/ending credits).This documentary reminded me of The Nazis: A Warning From History, which also included many interviews of WWII German military men.Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTOKY9CFAO6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NA26SQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VTOKY9CFAO6N","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:11 MinsAmazon was the seller. I purchased it ""used - very good"" for 55 bucks.I made 2 attempts to buy this item ""used"" from Amazon. During the first attempt, the item was previously damaged by the person who had returned it (and Amazon didn't notice the damage); but the Amazon return process was quick, easy, and free. The second attempt was a success.===========================INSTALLATION and MEASUREMENTS===========================It's pretty easy to put it together. The pieces are plastic, so they are light weight. The plastic seems sturdy enough. The instructions were good enough. One thing to be careful of is the pegs on the steps. When installing the steps and front panels. Do not twist the steps/panels from side-to-side. Press the pegs of the steps/panels straight into the large sides of the stairs. If you wiggle or bend the steps/panels from side-to-side, then the pegs may break-off (and that's what I had to return the first ""used"" item that I bought--the person before me broke the pegs on some of the front panels).If you have difficult pressing the pegs into the large sides of the stairs, then apply some oil or soap, and they will slide right in.You can google the instructions, or just visit the first comment to my review, where I posted a link to the instructions on the manufacturer's website.The carpet that covers the steps is thin, but it's adequate to keep the dog from slipping.Step Measurements:The top of each step: (not including the lip of the large side panels on either side of the step)* all steps:13.5 inches wide* top step: 9.5 inches deep* bottom 3 steps: about 8.75 inches deep* front part of each step: about 6 inches tallThe lip of the two large side panels adds about 2 inches total to the width of the steps (i.e., one inch on each side of the step).The steps are not level/flat (by design); the steps are angled up (if viewed when walking up the steps).Overall Staircase Measurements:The back/tallest part is about 30.5 inches tall.It is about 33.5 inches deep.It is about 15.5 inches wide.================PERFORMANCE================I got these stairs for my Chihuahua as a toy. I live next to a park and my fence is only 4 feet tall. When he hears people in the park, he runs outside along the fence and barks for a bit, but he can't see what he is barking at. So, I thought it would be fun for him to see what is in the park. This way he can associate sounds to sights.Dog weight wasn't an issue for me. And my dog doesn't have arthritis or something. I got the 4-step version of this product for height (so my dog could see out the window and over the fence). I added a small barrier around the top step (so my dog didn't get the feeling that he would fall off the other side); I just took some cardboard and wedged it between the top step and the large side panels. Usually the dining table isn't next to the window (just for starting seeds/plants for a vegetable garden).He was nervous about using it for 4 days or so. I placed treats on each stair step, and eventually he made it all the way to the top.I used to say ""wanna see?"" and then offer to lift him up, so that he could see what was happening in the park. As part of his training to use the steps, when there was someone in the park, I would tell him ""wanna see?"" and then point to the steps. That was his cue to use the steps.At about 10 days or so, he learned to use the steps himself when he heard a noise in the park.  After a couple of months, it became one of his favorite places (to sit in the sun light, and to watch what happens in the park).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PWA8RKNVPC8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SZSYAW#wasThisHelpful","R2PWA8RKNVPC8C","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series had promise, and I was looking forward to it. But for me, it fell short. Here are some of my observations after watching the first 2 DVDs in the series:Complaining. And more complaining. Whining. And more whining. Drama. Sometimes lots of drama. That's not my idea of the regular military or National Guard, but that's what this series portrays. Why not just do your duty without the groaning, moaning, and griping?What is the main reason why people join the National Guard? Is it just to make an extra buck? Sounds like it to me.One guardsman held up a handmade sign that said ""what happened to 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year?"" When you join the National Guard, don't you know that you could be called to active duty? Didn't these guys know that?""Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what your country can do for you!"" That's the impression I got from most of the guardsmen in the series.Why are people allowed to be in the National Guard if they are not deploy-able? It doesn't make sense.If your marriage is rocky, then a deployment won't help it. More drama.Some of the guardsmen didn't have their facts straight:Iraq didn't attack or invade the USA.Iraq didn't cause 9/11.Some of the guardsmen likened their Iraq situation to the Vietnam War. None of those guardsmen were in Vietnam. Those 2 wars were very different.The religious people and their church drama were awful. It reminded me of the religious people and synagogues that Christ encountered when He walked the planet. They were showy, glitzy, trivial, carnal, fake, ungodly; they did things to impress the people around them.For any given episode (there are 3 episodes per DVD), roughly half of an episode is about the guardsmen in Iraq, and the other half of the episode is about the life of their loved ones back home.After watching the first 2 DVDs, I didn't care enough about the series to watch the last 2 DVDs.This program shows a small cross-section of society. Folks in the National Guard come from all walks of life, but you wouldn't know that from this program. I think this program does the National Guard a disservice, which is a shame.Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RI527H7I41S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HC2LTY#wasThisHelpful","R1RI527H7I41S4","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed WWII in HD, so I was looking forward to ""Vietnam in HD"".""Vietnam in HD"" starts with 1964. The USA went to war to kill commies. That's just about as much history as you get. The rest is war footage. The lack of history prior to 1964 was disappointing to me.Unlike ""WWII in HD"", the footage in ""Vietnam in HD"" was produced more like a movie than a documentary. It seemed like its purpose was more to entertain than to educate. This was also disappointing to me.At the end of the Battle of Inchon episode, they described that battle as a triumph and huge success for USA forces. Really? That screamed propaganda to me. That was about 50 minutes into DVD #1. Based on the footage and narration, it was not a huge success.Things I liked about this DVD:* veteran interviews* lots of war footage (mostly in color)* narrator* well organized (by year)Things I did NOT like about this DVD:* Lack of history* The music was too much like a military recruiting video.* Produced like a movie, not a documentary* For the most part, they used young voice actors for recounting war events (they should have used the veterans).The point of this DVD is to show color footage of the war. Don't expect a thorough historical documentary.The one telltale phrase that stuck with me went something like this: The Vietnamese have been battling foreign invaders for over 1000 years.If you want to learn about Vietnam before/during/after (i.e., some real history about the country and the war), then I highly recommend Vietnam - A Television History.Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://smile.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/http://smile.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCGPRX9ZQI7ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BSCPY0#wasThisHelpful","RCGPRX9ZQI7ER","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DVD started with war footage.  Then there was a very brief attempt at the history of Korea.  Then the war footage continued.  What was Korea like before the war?  I don't know.  I just know that the Commies came from the north, and the USA came from the South, and there was a war in Korea.  Disappointing.The footage is black-and-white, but mostly washed-out white, which makes it difficult to watch.The sound/narration starts-out muffled, but it got better quickly.The narrator was professional, and the narration was somewhat informative.  However, for the most part, the narration did not match the footage.  Most of the time, the footage was random, short war clips strung together.  What was actually happening in the footage?  I don't know.  The narrator just kept telling the Korean War story without regard to the footage itself.  The footage of Inchon seemed to match the narration, but that was not the norm for this documentary.I am still looking for a well-round documentary about the Korean War.  I had the same problem while looking for a decent documentary about the Vietnam War, but I eventually found this excellent documentary: Vietnam - A Television History.  Maybe there is something like it for the Korean War, but I haven't found it yet.UPDATE 6/29/15I found a well-round Korean War documentary; here it is: Korea The Forgotten War - 4 DVD Set.Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGJ3S2P76VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AABL4E#wasThisHelpful","R1IGJ3S2P76VG","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched Dunkirk and part of Norway on the first DVD. Then I turned it off. The narrator was a bit sensational at times, and boring at other times. The music didn't fit.

How did WWII start?  What role did Russia play? None of these questions are answered. And why would they start a 5-DVD set with Dunkirk? Is that where the war started? Then they skip to Norway. Why?

"The seller was ValuePetSupplies. I paid 75 bucks.My 8-pound Chihuahua dog usually eats one in about 20 minutes.  It is something natural for him to chew-on, and it  helps to keep tartar and plaque down.  I give one to him a couple times a week.  He liked most of these (got through 50 of them over time), but he got sick on some of them.  I thought maybe it was because they were too rich/fatty; but the last time he got sick, it was like food poisoning.  So, I stopped giving them to him.These sticks don't smell much when they are dry (in the bag); but when my dog starts chewing on one, then it really stinks. My dog was eating one in my bedroom one evening, and I had to escort him into the living room. After he finished, he joined me in the bedroom again. His breath was bad due to the stick. So, my lesson learned was: Don't give these bully sticks to my dog shortly before bed (since he sleeps with me, and I don't want bully stick breath in my bed!).They don't leave residue on the carpet or furniture, but if your dog eats them on carpet/furniture, then the bad smell will remain in it (dog's saliva + bully stick = stink).The package says they come from Brazil. You can also buy these directly from Value Pet Supplies; just Google their name, and visit their website; they have free shipping too.I used to get 6"" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply before they raised their prices. These are not as smelly as the ValueBull sticks, but they do cost more.For further dental care, I also use the following item in my dog's water: Pet Dental Liquid Tartar Remover Liquid 16 Fl OZ or V-Oratene Drinking Water Additive 4 oz. For variety, I also feed him Nylabone Nutri Dent Edible Dental Chew, 36 Count Extra Value Pack, and he likes those a lot too.Another healthy treat that my dog likes is Himalayan Chews, Dog Chew Treat Made of Yak Milk (Large). The best price I could find for those chews is at a place called New Puppy Pads. Pet Expertise also had good prices.

"The focus of this documentary is Germany (before, during, and after WWII). It contains color and black/white footage, much of which I had not seen before. It also reveals history about Germany, Hitler, and the Nazis that I was not aware of.The narration is very well done. The music is fine.One of the highlights of this documentary is the many interviews with German people as well as interviews Jewish people and other European people who were impacted by Hitler.My only complaint is that it seemed to end abruptly; I think they could have spent a little more time on the suicide of Hitler and those with him.Although there are only 2 DVDs to this set, it contains a wealth of information.

"The seller was JetAudio. I paid 249 bucks for this item in October 2004. I posted this review to epinions long ago, but they are shutting down, so I thought I'd share it on Amazon too.I debated between the 512MB and the 1GB units, but finally decided on the 1GB unit because I felt the extra 512MB was worth another $50; so, instead of being able to store about 8 hours of mp3 music, I can store 16 hours of mp3 music with the 1GB model (which is much more than I'll need, but it will keep me from deleting songs so that I can add new songs; this way, I can keep all the songs I like without having to add/delete).The quality is very good. Here are some points:1) Be careful opening the battery compartment; be sure to just slide the compartment open a little bit and then lift it out (as opposed to sliding it completely back to expose the USB connection). If you slide the compartment all the way back and then lift up, then you will break-off the little tab which keeps the compartment housing attached to the unit for USB use. You'll see what I mean when you handle the unit (just be gentle).2) The buttons are well positioned and they all worked just fine. The menu structure is simple to learn and easy to use.3) The unit was smaller than I had expected, which is great.4) The screen is big and clear. The colors are cool.5) The battery indicator works well, and if you click on the Information menu, you can see the actual battery voltage (a really neat feature, I thought).6) The sound is excellent. There are several ways to adjust sounds (as indicated in the product details at the beginning of the Amazon webpage).7) The radio worked great.8) The voice recording also worked great.9) The product does NOT include an armband as indicated in the product details section. It does include a neck strap. I have reported this inaccuracy to Amazon. You can purchase an armband from JetAudio for a reasonable amount...see their website.10) I connected to Windows XP without any problems (after turning-off my virus scanner and the Windows firewall).11) I was able to download mp3 songs to the unit just fine; the download speed is fast.12) I did not install the software CD. You don't need it to copy files to the unit (just use Windows Explorer).13) I did upgrade the firmware to version 1.60a (which you can download from the iAudio or JetAudio websites).14) The unit is very attractive; I purchased the metal silver (they also have a model with a black face plate).15) Check-out iAudio's website for a lot of helpful info like user forums, where folks post helpful stuff about iAudio units.16) The unit comes with 1GB of memory, but due to the firmware and special effects, 983MB is available for music/file storage (which is still plenty for me).I'm very pleased with my iAudio4 1GB unit.My only complaint: This unit was pricey when compared to other units. I seriously considered the Creative Labs Muvo TX FM 512MB, but the 512MB version was not available at the time...only the 256MB version was available. Creative Labs prices were much more reasonable; and after doing much research, I learned that this particular Creative Labs product also received top marks from consumers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1P5PL7NA7B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AOQ9O#wasThisHelpful","RR1P5PL7NA7B6","A12LH2100CKQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12LH2100CKQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Usable for both inkjet and laser printers, Avery's White Shipping Labels (8.5"" x 11"") help deliver a quick and efficient way to get packages out the door, while also looking professional.  Depending on the size of packages you typically ship, the full sheet version might be a bit much, but in some cases it's the perfect size.The labels have been completely error free.  No jamming in both a Brother and HP printer that I tested.  They were also smudge-free.  Creating the labels is simple use Avery's templates.  You may also have other software or shipping possibilities (eBay).

"Black + Decker's PureOptics Summit Flex Desk Lamp stands out with it's thin profile and quality build. Add in the ability to adjust multiple light levels and it's professional look, and I call it a winner.The most surprising thing about the lamp is the weight.  Even before I took it out of the box I was surprised by the heftiness.  That's not a bad thing, as the base is very sturdy and again, the lamp is nice and has a really nice build quality.  There are multiple adjustments (hinges) that allow you to direct the light in nearly any direction.  The hinges are fairly sturdy without give unless you bump or hit it hard.I was also pleased with the amount of light output that the lamp had.  The light was diffused well and while there was plenty of output it was not glaring.  A USB power port is included, I just wish it had at least two ports.  That is a minor gripe though.Overall, a solid and professional desk lamp.  It looks good on your desk and provides excellent lighting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBXO9TJWGDTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW743C#wasThisHelpful","ROBXO9TJWGDTY","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used many TP-LINK products (switches, extenders, etc) and I was excited to try this Tri-Band wireless router.  The TP-Link AC3200 (Archer C3200) is a beast in terms of speed and connectivity.  Like many other companies right now, the outside design is a bit much, but there is no questioning the advantages of a router like this.Setup is extremely easy.  You can go the more typical route of plugging it into a laptop or use their iOS or Android app.  You can easily have it going in under 15 minutes, or a little longer if you choose to do additional configuration.  Then you can begin adding your devices.  For me, that is over ten devices, so that part of the process may take longer.  I didn't have any issues  getting my phones, tablets, computers, media devices, or printer hooked up and going.The wifi coverage is excellent.  I was using an extender previously for one portion of my house, but with the Archer C3200, I'm covering the entire area needed.  Best of all, I've had absolutely zero issues staying connected and the speed has been exceptional.  The Smart Connect helps your network by assigning devices to the best channel.  While I did not test the parental controls, they looked easy to configure and would be helpful for some users.Overall, I'm impressed.  The ease of use, configuration options, plus excellent speed and connectivity earn the TP-Link Archer C3200 five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWDDCEJK0KEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWDDCEJK0KEZ","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The next installment of Adobe Acrobat tries to continue improving upon tools and functions that have long been more than acceptable to 75% of us.  The majority of home and business users likely only use half of the features that are in Acrobat.  Creating PDFs, editing them (removing pages, adding pages), making comments, and exporting PDFs likely cover most users.The problem is that rather truly improve upon those features, each release of Acrobat brings about mostly UI changes.  With DC, you also get (dragged) into the Adobe cloud more than before.  While there are certainly some useful things that DC brings, like signing abilities, it's very possible that you use another service for those needs.  For home users, it's possible that they don't even need what DC brings.  For small businesses and even larger organizations, it brings more requirements to your end users for activation and cloud services.Sadly, there just isn't enough improvement in the basic features of Acrobat in this version to warrant and upgrade.  In fact, that has really been the case the last couple of versions.  If you need Acrobat and don't mind the cloud bit, then there certainly isn't anything wrong in DC.  But if you have a prior version, there isn't as much reason to go for an upgrade.  Acrobat is the standard for PDFs, so it's hard not use it, but I'm finding prior versions to be fairly useful at the moment.  If you need simple PDF creation you may look elsewhere.  If you need more complicated editing, conversions, or signature abilities, then DC will fulfill your needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UG8IL1UYOCGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8XHZK6#wasThisHelpful","R1UG8IL1UYOCGR","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are fairly lightweight and are good for most evenings.The pearls standout very well, being roped with the sterling silver and stones.  They are noticeable, however, the stones aren't hardly as evident.  I didn't think they had as much sparkle or shine.  Near the top where the larger stones are there is a bit more sparkle.  I would say that they are elegant overall, but not modern.  The earrings offer a nice touch of class without going overboard.  The metal is a bit dulled.  The weight if fairly light.

"NOCO's XGrid XGB3L Rugged USB Battery Pack and LED Flashlight is tough, bright, and incredibly useful.  With its multiple uses, small footprint, and tough exterior it's great to throw in glove compartment, safety/emergency box, or keep with you.The rubberized exterior makes it great for outdoor use (another great use is for hunting or camping).  But the toughness also speaks to being able to throw it in an emergency box for disasters and accidents.  Not only can it serve as an extra light source, but it can charge your phone.  The light has different modes, but it is bright, especially for up close viewing.  A strobe mode is included as well.The device itself gets a charge fairly quick and after charging a few different phones from it, I can say that it provides consistent and constant power.

"AmazonBasics' Digital Kitchen Scale is a great tool to have in your kitchen.  While scales are great for baking, they are also good for other cooking or postage (as long as it will not be over 11 pounds).The styling of the scale is very simple and nothing fussy.  It's small and can easily slide into a drawer.  It's size is perfect for a kitchen.  The LCD screen is easily readable and can display results in ounces, grams, pounds, or kilograms.  There are two buttons (Unit and Tare to adjust for container weight).Overall, the weights were spot on.  Design is very good.

"The Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear headphones (for Apple devices) deliver a clear, crisp sound in a very small package.  The headphones just work and best of all, they stay in place.  Very little hassle and great sound.While I don't really consider myself to be an expert at sound quality (I'm the type that uses reasonably priced headphones), I'm very surprised at the output these headphones produce.  I've experienced a few high quality headphones before and usually found them to be better but overpriced.  The Bose SoundTrue, however, deliver not only great sound at a reasonable price but do so using the in-ear style of headphones.The sound is crisp and the bass is deep but not overpowering.  Environment noise is pretty well hidden as well.  The headphones fit snugly in the ear without being uncomfortable.  I tried all three sets of StayHear tips (small, medium, large) and settled on the medium.  The fit was excellent and tips stayed in place while at my desk and also while moving around.

"The Timex RediSet Dual Alarm Clock has plenty of features that you don't always see in other alarm clocks and offers a twist in the typical design.  There are a couple of annoyances, but overall it's a quality clock that deserves a spot on your nightstand.  Easily five stars.This Timex alarm clock has a dual alarm, which is not something I use often.  It's nice to have though.  It also has a gradual alarm.  A nifty feature I found was the nap timer.  You can set a nap alarm without changing your typical alarm settings.Having USB charging is another plus as it's something we all need or use and it's built into the clock.  That, together with the nightlight make this clock better than your standard clock.  The numbers are also large and easy to read.  I realize these sound like small things, but they are nice features to see on an alarm clock.The design and visual appeal is also a bit different.  The clock is a bit thin, but tall.  Most clocks tend to be flat.  It's a difference that makes the clock feel more modern.  However, it feels a little top heavy.  The buttons are a bit hard to distinguish (rounded and designed to be more modern, but can be hard to find in the dark).Overall, this alarm clock is a winner.  Nice design and plenty of little extras and features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YISNPSEQJP6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY936OS#wasThisHelpful","R1YISNPSEQJP6J","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belkin's USB 2.0 Ethernet Adapter (F4U047bt) is a quick and easy way to add an Ethernet connection to an ultrabook or other computer that does not have room for an Ethernet connection.  Many laptops/ultrabooks today forgo the Ethernet connection in order to make their devices smaller.Belkin's device is simple to use and installation was a snap.  Most likely you will not need the included software CD as your device will likely have the drivers and you'll be ready to go, as was the case in my situation.  Plug it in and within a few moments you are ready to go.  It's small enough to throw in a briefcase and take with you when you travel.  These are usually a necessity for IT folks as you never know when you need a hardwired connection.For gigabit capabilities, get the Belkin USB 3 version.

"The George Foreman GFG240X Dual Surface Griddle + Grill is a versatile small kitchen appliance that offers plenty of space and tends to beat out griddles I have used in the past.First, the cooking space is pretty large.  I was surprised when the box showed up because it was fairly huge.  There is definitely plenty of cooking space.  On the flip side, however, you have to store this thing somewhere.  I'm not going to lie, you will either need a large drawer/cabinet or leave it on your countertop.  The plus is that you can easily cook breakfast or any other meal for multiple people.Second, I love the versatility of the grill and griddle.  I know it seems like a small feature, but it could be great to grill some meat or vegetables, then use the griddle for heating sides up.  Grease does flow away from the food.  Cleanup is very easy as well.The one downside, besides size (which is also a positive) is the evenness of cooking.  There were some spots that seemed cooler than others, but I've always found that on almost every griddle I've used.

"Leggett & Platt’s Signature Adjustable Platform Base has been a delight.  While never personally owning an adjustable bed, I’ve always considered purchasing one.  I have, however, tested many out and been around others that own them.  Thankfully I recently purchased a mattress a few months ago and it was definitely compatible with adjustable bases.It’s important to note that installing this platform is not a one man job.  It’s heavy and as expected it comes in a large box.  You should definitely plan to have some help getting this moved in and properly setup.  For me, that moving it up a flight of stairs.  Not easy, but again, have yourself some assistance.It was worth the effort, though, as I’ve been extremely pleased and impressed.  The motor has a good amount of lifting capacity and it handles weight with ease.  It is smooth moves up and down fairly quick.  Best of all, it’s quiet.  Among the quietest I have heard.If there is one thing that is unmistakable, it’s that this product is made of quality materials and produced with care.  The upholstery, metals, everything is made well.  After almost a month of use and you don’t hear any squeaks or noises.  Even the remote feels nice.  The remote control is simple to use (easy to remember which button is which without looking at the remote).  Large buttons, so even in the dark you can use.  But, it’s also backlit, so that’s a plus.As someone that has issues with heartburn/indigestion and other stomach issues, I look forward to many more years of use out of this bed platform.  Being able to raise the head  is extremely important and has been a relief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFHZ76UNU7HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPZOHZS#wasThisHelpful","R3VFHZ76UNU7HA","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monoprice's 16,000 mAh Portable Charger gives you enough charging power not only in a pinch, but enough to recharge devices over and over for an extended period of time.The Charger comes in a non-retail packaging, so it is a simple cardboard box with the charger and USB cable inside.  No need to worry about having to cut through typical plastic packaging, but keep that in mind if ordering as a gift.  Like many other portable chargers, a wall charger is not included (but you can use other USB wall chargers or a powered USB hub or computer, keeping in mind that the type of charger will effect the recharge time).At 16,000 mAh, the unit can be considered somewhat heavy, but keep in mind the amount of charging you are getting out of this unit.  Consider a smaller one, if that is a concern.  However, the unit is sturdy and appears to be built to last.  I have been able to charge multiple devices and still have plenty of power left in the portable charger.  There are two charging ports, which is sufficient for most cases.Overall, this a great unit.  Plenty of charging capacity and a quality build.  It should definitely be a consideration for you, especially if you are looking for a unit that can provide plenty of charging.

Not all of the 180 degrees will be for everybody, but the various angles give you some great control over prying items apart, pulling nails out, or countless other activities.  Best of all, the locking positions are very sturdy.The tool is tough.  Yet, the grip is comfortable and gives you plenty of control.  There is also a great striking surface when more power to loosen something is needed.  My only complaint is that after many strikes the locking mechanism seems a bit more loose than what it was.

"Preen's Weed Preventer is an excellent product.  They have a couple of variations, but I've used their products for a long time and always been happy with the results.  Depending on the size of the area you plan to treat, there are multiple sizes.  The smaller 5.6lb version comes in an easy to use bottle with a spout on the end for spreading.While Preen's Weed Preventer will not kill existing weeds, it's great at preventing new ones.  Early in the Spring, after weeding and cleaning, it's a good idea to put Preen's down.  Then follow up with another application about three months later.  It's easy to apply.  Like I said, the 5.6lb version has a spout to spread it easily.  Otherwise, you can get larger containers and use a spreader or small gardening tool to apply it (or the larger ones often come with a scoop).I use Preen every year and stand behind it.

"The Silk'n Blue Acne Solution Device is one of many products in a crowded market of skin and acne products.  After a short time with item, it does seem safe and easy to use.  It can be time consuming and results appear to be positive.  Of course, only long term usage can really determine the overall effectiveness.The instructions are easy to follow and using the device is simple to operate.  I will say that it takes time to cover the entire face (if needed), so that is something to keep in mind.  Covering limited affected areas is a little easier, but still time consuming.  It also seems a bit flimsy, so I would be concerned about its lifespan.I personally have notice some improvement over the short term.  I'd be interested to see how it goes over the recommended 6-8 weeks.  I found it best to use in evening when more time was available, but it is supposed to be used twice daily.  It gets warm, but nothing too terribly uncomfortable.  I think it's worth adding this to your skincare treatment.  I still think other products might be necessary, but there has been some effectiveness after using the Silk'n Blue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQUEWLUXX8LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET86JSG#wasThisHelpful","R1TQUEWLUXX8LS","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new twist on an old favorite is offered in Nature Valley's Soft Baked Granola Bites.  At first, I was really eager to give these a try as I love Nature Valley's soft granola bars.  They are often full of flavor and have a variety of ingredients.  These granola bites are basically in the shape of a ball, but I think they are a bit larger than bite sized.  They could be a little smaller.As for taste, the blueberry was hardly noticeable.  There were almonds, mostly noticeable by their texture.  Unfortunately, the flavor profile was fairly flat and one note.  The bites were soft, but I quickly grew tired of them.  I would have loved to have more flavor in them and a smaller size.As a side note, the bites arrived mostly smashed from shipping (that was a shipping issue though and was not reflected in my rating and review).","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LPUJ4J7H4LT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNOL6#wasThisHelpful","R24LPUJ4J7H4LT","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kitchen Aid KCPI40CRAC Professional Cast Iron Casserole Pot is a beautiful piece of cookware.  It performs very well and has excellent build quality.While this pot is great for stews and similar items on top of the stove, you can also put it in the oven.  Even better?  The lid also serves as a cast iron grill pan!  All you have to do is flip it over.  I love the versatility of that.As soon as you receive this item and take it out of the package (although you will want to clean it a bit just like any new item), it will be ready to go.  It's preseasoned and done very well.  The exterior is a beautiful and smooth.  I have the Almond Cream, which is a nice, versatile color.  But the quality of this item is great from the interior to the exterior.Cooking with it is great.  I don't use it for everything, but love doing stews or braised type of dishes in them.  Best of all, if you keep care of this cookware it will literally last forever.  Kitchen Aid has a winner with this one, they did not cut corners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT6ZKZT7KFDDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVTE6NI#wasThisHelpful","RT6ZKZT7KFDDV","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips SHQ2300LF/27 Action Fit Sports earbuds have some promising qualities, but lack in a few key areas.  Having a pair of earbuds/headphones that can withstand workouts, action, and moving around are great, but the Action Fit Sports took some getting used to.  There are also headphones in this series, as well as earbuds.The earbuds are very lightweight, which were impressive.  They were almost unnoticeable from that perspective.  At times, I almost had to make sure they were still in my ear and that's the problem.  They are lightweight and can be hard to notice, but the sound was not very noticeable either.  The fit in the ears was not as idea as I had hoped.  Worse yet, outside noise was distracting and not well displaced by the earbuds.  Also, they were also a bit awkward.  The earbud itself is small, but the outer part is larger and that part was noticeable in the ear.There are some positives here, though.  The cable clip is a nice addition and the cable does a good job of staying tangle free.  In contrast, the cable is also a bit stiff, but that's likely what lends itself to being tangle-free.  I just wish there was more performance, sound output, and noise reduction.

"The Haier ESAQ406P Ultra Quiet Window Air Conditioner sells itself on being quiet and powerful.  In many instances, this is the case and the unit does an excellent job of cooling.Upon receiving the unit, I can say it is certainly heavy.  The weight might be on par with other units that cool this amount of space, but I'm used to using smaller window air conditioners.  Installation was as expected, but make sure you have some assistance.I picked a perfect time to get this air conditioner as we had a hot streak of weather.  It has since cooled down a bit, but I was able to put the unit through its paces.  It did an excellent job of cooling about a 300 sq ft space.  It was never uncomfortable.  The weather has ranged from high 90s down to high 60s.  During the nights we were able to use the quiet mode and it was extremely pleasant.  During the day other fan speeds were used and it was a little more quiet than other units.  But most of the selling point here likely comes in the quiet mode.Overall, I have been very pleased.  It has kept up with the weather and offers many options with the fan and controls, as well as the adjustable vents in the front.  This is my first experience with Haier, but so far it has been pleasant","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JE70ICE0QH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPL54EE#wasThisHelpful","R30JE70ICE0QH0","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Belkin Pocket Sleeve for the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is a nice case, with moderate protection and a few extras that other cases do not provide.  I've used a good number of SP3 cases and I'm always on the lookout for something that improves upon the others.  Personally, I'm not a fan of this material, although it is soft and very durable.  Overall, the Belkin Pocket Sleeve is a good four stars.First, I got the blue one, which is a nice color.  It's a bit bright, but is a pleasant color.  The padding is adequate and just enough for most protection without being too thick.  It fits the SP3 fairly well, although with the keyboard on it's a little tight.  That's the case with move sleeves and cases I have used.Second, the sleeve provides a zippered pocket and stylus loop.  It's nice to see that they actually did think about the stylus, that's something a lot of competitors have left out.  The pocket is enough store either the stylus as well, or a slim mouse, pen, and other accessories.Overall, the Belkin Pocket Sleeve is a solid sleeve.  It provides protection and storage without being bulky.  While my personal preference is leather or something besides neoprene, this sleeve is still a solid buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBW85G33SS6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWGZSWM#wasThisHelpful","R3NBW85G33SS6O","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zenna Home Luxury Hotel Waffle Weave Shower Curtain is a nice for just about any bathroom.  It's very similar to what you would find in many hotels, spas, etc.  The material is really nice, it's soft and durable.Personally, I've never liked combined curtains and liners, so I am using this with an additional liner.  The fabric of this item is really nice and I'd consider it be more of a curtain.  Like others, it might be questionable if it's truly a waffle weave and instead just a pattern.  But I think it's nice, durable, and has an elegant touch.The length and width are standard, and it hangs nicely.  It wasn't too wrinkled out of the package.  If you have seen these in a hotel, you'll likely know that they do soak up water (again, I'm using it more as a curtain with another liner behind it).  Overall, though, it's easily a four star item.  Possibly five stars.  You will thoroughly enjoy the fabric, design, and overall addition to your décor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW46PVTPG1XOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HVGLZ2#wasThisHelpful","RW46PVTPG1XOW","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon opening the packaging my first response was wow, these look really great.  The design looks great (refined, subtle, and can likely match most decors) and they appear to be very well made.  There are three different colors/shades and each has a decorative strip along the bottom.These look great laying around, hanging on an oven handle, or hanging up on a wall/elsewhere (there is a nifty strap on each towel on one corner that allows you to easily hang them on a hook).  Design, is easily five stars.  I gave it four stars, because they are not very absorbent.  While they are great for general use, if you are drying more than a few dishes they won't soak up as much water as a really thick towel.  With that said, I'd definitely recommend these and will likely get more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZMJ7R6QEMYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6UMWM#wasThisHelpful","R3TZMJ7R6QEMYS","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Urban Armor Gear's Microsoft Surface 3 Composite Case is a good option for those looking for extended, tough protection for their Surface 3.  If you need general protection, I would not necessarily recommend it.  This is certainly meant for those that are drop prone or need the Surface in the field or other special needs.  However, it's a good fit and they took great care in making sure it accommodated the Surface 3.As stated, for those that need it, this is a great option.  It's a bit bulky, but that is where the protection is coming from.  The corner protection is very good and thick.  There is an integrated spot for the stylus, which is awesome.  There's also a kickstand to take the place of the original Surface 3 kickstand (some cases work around the original kickstand).  The kickstand is stiff, so hopefully it will stand the test of time, but it seems to work very well.  Use of the screen isn't really interrupted and you can still use the side swipes of Windows 8.Overall, I'm fairly pleased.  Good for field use and other potential use cases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZN6RU4OJJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJYTYK8#wasThisHelpful","RXZN6RU4OJJ8","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Netgear AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender works very well, helping to eliminate dead spots in the home and extend coverage.  Not only was coverage very good, but speed was great as well.  Installation/configuration was fairly simple and the overall design is on par with other similar units.Upon opening the box, you can have this configured fairly quick.  If you have WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that will be the quickest and easiest option for you.  However, you can setup with the additional Netgear instructions fairly easily if you need to.  Within 5-10 minutes max, you should be good to go.  The device does not cover up the second plug on your outlet, so you can still use it for whatever you need.  The antennas are not really in the way either.  The device is somewhat thick (although it's about equal to other devices in this category that I have used), so you  may be able to back furniture right up to it, but it's no worse than a plug sticking out.I installed this about 30-35 linear feet (different floor though) from my router.  It's providing much better coverage in my home where it was weak in two corners.  The speed is very comparable to what it was before this device.  So it's providing good coverage with no speed noticeable speed reduction.  There is a nifty Analytics App, but unfortunately it's not available on all platforms.  Overall, this is typical Netgear quality and works very well out of the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNPJQ0YDKY7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CLCW#wasThisHelpful","R3SNPJQ0YDKY7J","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hefty's Extra Strong Drawstring Multipurpose Trash Bags are thicker and stronger than normal.  They can serve many purposes and although the extra strength and thickness is noticeable, I'm not sure I would have these bags as my go-to.  I tend to go for normal trash bags or ultra strength (contractor) for big jobs outside.The extra strong bags offer a nice go between, though.  They are suitable for tougher cleanup jobs inside or for general storage. They don't tear very easily, unless the objects are very sharp or have hard corners.  Things that would normally tear a standard trash bag, like cardboard don't really penetrate the extra strong bags.It's nice to keep a box of these around when you need them if it's worth the extra cost to you.

The flavors are spot on, nothing tastes different, but these Starburst minis were very fresh.  They are probably about half the size of normal Starburst candies.Upon initially opening the package, very few of the candies were stuck together.  With time some more might stick, but like I said they were very fresh.  Best of all, they don't stick in your hand either.  The only problem with Starburst minis is that you can eat way too many.

"As someone that is a heavy sleeper and a habitual snooze button addict, I had my doubts about the Philips Wake-UP Light with Radio.  The design is somewhat unusual, it's more modern, but it will definitely raise some questions when people see it.  Functionality and overall use is quick and easy to learn.  For light sleepers, there is not doubt this will work.  For heavy sleepers, I think it depends on your routine, room light, and overall sleeping routine.The gentle increase of light is great (I tested it out while awake and asleep).  It really does slowly increase and turns to a very nice, room-filling light.  The light can also be used as a general light on your nightstand.  The alarms sounds are good, but I would still like to see a more normal beeping type of sound (I realize that defeats the purpose of a more gentle solution like this, but some people would prefer it).  It could still be a gradual increase of sound.  The natural sounds are nice, but there are only two, and at this price point I think a few more would be warranted.  For myself, I found that the sounds and gradual increase of light woke me up most of the time, but not all the time.  I let a lighter sleeper borrow the clock and they found that it woke them up very well.  If you are a heavy sleeper that rotates in bed and might be facing any direction or buried in the pillows (yes, I know this is sad) you might get mixed results.  I'd say their claim of 9 out of 10 users found that is work is likely accurate.The controls are nice, but being more touch oriented, the buttons can be hard to distinguish.  A battery backup, again, at this price point is expected.  In fact, it's pretty much expected in every alarm clock, but is not included.Overall, this is a nice alarm clock and it offers a nice, gentle way to wake up.  Some people might have mixed results, but for the most part I'm sure it will work the majority of users.  There are a few features that would add to its benefit, but for those wishing to have a new waking up experience, this would still be a nice unit to try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUJK84VSP86G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFNMYN8#wasThisHelpful","R2CUJK84VSP86G","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sterling Silver Diamond Butterfly Pendant necklace has a nice design with a relatively small diamond setting, making it a nice piece of jewelry at a reasonable price.  The butterfly is approximately an inch across, so the piece is certainly noticeable.The sterling silver has a very nice, polished look that shines and catches the light very well.  The diamonds are not super clear, but offer some contrast to the rest of the piece.  The diamonds are a bit larger at top and get a little smaller down the line.  The design and flow of the butterfly is very nice.  The lines are very smooth and it makes for a piece of jewelry, especially for everyday wear.The chain itself is fairly standard and while there are no complaints about it, the packaging was less than to be desired.  It was extremely tangled when the box was opened.  Only a small piece of fabric was instead to protect the jewelry, so it bounced around and got tangled up.  That's a relatively small issue though.

"Excellent weed preventing with the added benefit of plant food.  As someone that has used Preen's weed preventer in the past, I can attest to it's wondrous powers.  But seriously, it works extremely well.  Apply it early and then again in three months and you'll be weed free through summer and fall.  If you live in areas with extended seasons or warm weather, just keep applying every three months.Application is super easy.  I usually like to do it when cleaning up the yard in early spring and applying new mulch, etc.  Keep in mind that this is weed preventer.  It's not meant to kill existing weeds, it's supposed to prevent new weeds before they start.Now, this is the first time I've used Preen that also includes plant food.  So I'm excited to see how well that works, unfortunately, I won't be able to post the results in just thirty days.

"The Philips 452391 Slimstyle LED Bulb is a perfect replacement for indoor traditional BR30 light bulbs.  The output is very good, you can hardly tell that it's LED versus other types.  The coverage is excellent and the light beam is fairly wide.Once installed in a recessed can, it looks like any other bulb.  With its wide beam, it fills a room nicely, especially when you have a few recessed lights.  The color is fairly average, on the soft white side of lighting, but not hardly as warm as traditional bulbs.  It's close though.  I'd recommend changing all of the recessed lights in a room for the most even lighting color and coverage.

"The Kensington KP400 Switchable Bluetooth Keyboard is a nifty keyboard that can serve multiple devices.  I've always purchased Logitech or Microsoft keyboards, but the KP400 has me looking at Kensington as a great keyboard manufacturer.  This keyboard may not be for everybody based on use and feel, however, it performs very well and is a five star device.You can tell the KP400 is a bit different than your standard desktop keyboard.  The look and feel is more like that of a laptop.  The keys are lower and don't have as much bounce back.  I actually prefer this style.  Even though the keys are lower there is still great feedback and response, yet is quiet.  The layout of keys is fairly common to other keyboards, but the backslash key is located on the left side near the Crtl and Alt keys.  The design of the keyboard is more sleek and modern.The KP400's greatest feature is the ability to switch from USB to Bluetooth.  If you have a desktop or laptop hooked up on USB, but have another laptop or tablet connected on Bluetooth you can easily go back and forth.  It's not a feature for everybody, but if you have multiple devices you'll likely love it.

Overall, these provide an easy way to promote your event or business with relative ease while looking very professional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6DKIFEQ7FCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HV2JU#wasThisHelpful","R2C6DKIFEQ7FCX","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Maroo Folio for the Surface Pro 3 is one of the best cases I have used for my SP3.  I've tried many cases and none of them really succeeded.  Some were too tight, some too loose and big, some didn't have a good loop for the pen.  This folio, however, has been keeping my SP3 protected for awhile now.The materials are nice.  The grey felt combined with the dark brown synthetic leather is a good balance.  Good stitching and overall great quality.  Unlike so many cases out there, this was actually designed for the SP3.  Most cases were designed for other devices and just slightly adapted to the SP3.  One easy way to tell is the nice fit.  The case is slim, but the SP3 is easily slipped into the case and removed.  It's not too snug, it's just right.Taking the device in and out the case is also made easier by the material used on the interior.  It doesn't case friction with the SP3's type cover, which was a problem on nearly SP3 case I tried.  There is a loop for the stylus on the inside, but it doesn't get in the way of the device.  So you don't have to worry about scratching the sides of the Surface.I definitely recommend this case for anyone that is looking for a well designed product to match the great design of the Surface Pro 3.  Get this case and skip the others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E63JDQCNLMXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M43LWXU#wasThisHelpful","R2E63JDQCNLMXH","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery's Tri-Fold Brochure with Tear-Aways cards is a nifty idea.  At first, I questioned the need for the tear-away cards on brochures.  They suggest using them as business cards, coupons, or promotions.  I don't see much need in using them as business cards, but the coupons or promotional use is a great idea.Designing and printing the brochures is simple, as are most Avery products.  The material is a nice product and it feels professional.  The cards are pre-scored, but could use a better perforation.Overall, the brochures with cards are a nice touch.  They might have limited use in some businesses, but do offer a good amount of professionalism and are a simple way to deliver promotions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60CF6SXRZLGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FKRWU8#wasThisHelpful","R60CF6SXRZLGB","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Norelco NT3155/60 Trimmer is one of the better trimmers I have ever used.  When I first took the device out of the package I could tell it was a well made item.  It felt solid and strong, unlike many of the cheap trimmers that last only a couple of months.The battery compartment cover is firm, the blade on top is solid as well.  I know it sounds silly, but if you have used many trimmers you are well aware of how flimsy most of them feel.  Even the comb that fits on the blade is snug and secure.After popping the battery in and turning the trimmer on you are instantly surprised by the amount of power it delivers.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I really do love this trimmer, but if there is one fault it might be how the blade/trimmer is to the curve of the head.  It might just be me, but it was hard to determine if I had the blade down against the skin or area you wanted to trim.  It's easy enough to get used to, though, especially with the overall quality of the device.We'll see how long the trimmer lasts, but I have very high hopes.  It's one of my new favorite tools on the sink.  Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JKRL1MJDETVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTA8O#wasThisHelpful","R3JKRL1MJDETVQ","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BLU Studio 6.0 HD Smartphone is an excellent device, offering a phone with many nice features at a great off-contract price.  BLU does a great job of making their product feeling premium and overall, it's a good device for just about anybody.Opening the box, you get a pretty nice experience.  It's well packaged and includes a screen protector, headset, and case.  Most manufacturers don't include all the extras and expect you to purchase them individually.  So receiving them up front is a nice touch.  The case has a firm grip to it and fit the phone very well.  The cutout for the headphone jack was a little rough, but not a big deal.  The screen protector was fairly average, fairly simple to install and did not disturb the use of the screen.  The only issue I had with the case was that it did make it difficult to use the buttons, but that is often the issue with cases.While the 6"" screen is a bit large, it is a really nice display.  It's clear and bright.  The phone itself feels fairly light for a 6"" device, but it's still a little bulky in your pocket.  Performance was very nice.  Most applications were snappy.  The processor held its own and the 1GB RAM was adequate.  Obviously, I would prefer more internal storage, but it's a great start.  You can add a micro SD card if the 8GB isn't enough (and it likely won't be enough).  That's an easy fix though and memory cards are super cheap these days.Phone quality was excellent when I tried it on the AT&T network.  Internet browsing on both the cellular network and Wi-Fi was good.  Camera was good and more than adequate, but not the camera of a premium or flagship device.  The charging port is on top, which some people love and some people hate.  I'm somewhat indifferent, but prefer a charging port on the bottom.One issue I had was with buttons.  The volume is on the left, directly across from the power/lock button on the opposite side.  While it may not be an issue on smaller phones, I found myself adjusting the volume when hitting the lock button.  The size of the device made me hold the device in a way where my thumb kept hitting the volume.Overall, I'm very pleased with the BLU Studio 6 HD.  It feels like a premium device.  While it does have a few minor quirks, the specifications hold up well and the phone is very easy to like and enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXW92T2ZTQCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R3PXW92T2ZTQCM","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Revlon Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush does a pretty good job with styling, but misses the mark in a few areas.  The overall styling ability is pretty good, it definitely gets hot enough (almost too hot) to style hair.  However, it's a bit too bulky, has no temperature control, and the size of the brush probably isn't the best for most people.My main issue is the fact that there is no temperature setting.  That really limits you and styling with this brush when at its hottest can be difficult.  The glove can be helpful, but it awkward with the bristles of the brush and the brush itself is a bit too small.  It can be difficult to style much.  But it does do a good job of styling when at the right temperature.  I wish the brush was a big larger, but then the entire thing might be too big.  Overall, it works, but is a bit disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W4CSOKKXW14R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3JDCH2#wasThisHelpful","R3W4CSOKKXW14R","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TP-LINK's UH720 USB 3 Hub with Smart Charging Ports works flawlessly.  It's fast, simple to setup, and provides plenty of USB inputs for all of your devices.  The USB Hub is equipped with USB 3.0, so you'll get plenty of transfer speed for your newest devices.Setup really is quick and easy.  As advertised, it's plug and play.  You are up and going quickly without hassle.  I tried several devices and all of them worked like a charm.  The device itself is nothing fancy.  It's black and does not stand out.  It's relatively small to have a large number of ports, so it's doesn't take up too much space.  The smart charging ports are handy, as well.The spacing between ports is just right.  The power is on the left, charging ports on the right, and the additional USB ports all lined up on front.  The device itself is fairly light.  If you don't have much hooked up to it, it can be somewhat easy to knock or pull off your desk.  However, once you have a few devices hooked up, it's sturdy and stays in place.Overall, it's been flawless.  If you have a large number of devices and want to have some extra charging ports, then the TP-LINK UH720 is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PU3IKJQ2OS0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCX6I8A#wasThisHelpful","R1PU3IKJQ2OS0W","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery's Matte White Flyers with Tear-Away Cards are a nifty business marketing product (although if you are advertising something in your local community, they'd be great for personal use, too).  While you could easily accomplish this task with a plain or stock piece of paper and simply precut the ends like most of us have done for years, the Avery version offers a very professional product.  For businesses, the quality and the ability to design your flyer and cards is simply fantastic.You can also layer the tear-away cards, placing more cards on a flyer in higher traffic areas, or returning to your flyer to add more at a later date when the first set has been depleted.  I know it sounds simple, but the ability to add cards and layer them is a great idea.  The cards tear away fairly easy as well.  My only concern is the adhesive.  While I didn't have any issue using them, I'd be concerned about extreme wet weather or extreme heat/cold having an effect on them.  But in my environment, during late Winter with temperatures above 30-40 degrees, I did not have any problems.Designing them is simple, as is the case with most Avery products.  Overall, I was thrilled with the idea of the tear-away cards and the implementation went very well.  Would definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MOIURRANK9C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C629CEU#wasThisHelpful","R3MOIURRANK9C1","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery's Adhesive Round Display Cards are a new alternative to tent cards.  I'd imagine there are tons of uses.  These would look very professional in a bakery, or any business that has a glass showcase of their products.  They would also be great for tradeshows, conferences, or anywhere you might have a booth setup.  A dinner party or buffet might also be a good use.They are very easy to design and print.  As is typical with Avery products, you have plenty of options out of the box, but there is plenty of room for your own adjustments and customizations.  The adhesive does a good job of holding, but I was more surprised at how cleanly they came off.  I've been extremely pleased with all the Avery products coming to consumers and small businesses lately.  They have really been producing some great products that can be used by any of us and the round display cards are no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAPN8WWJ7IA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJMJ90K#wasThisHelpful","R1BAPN8WWJ7IA5","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery's Small (2"" x 3.5"") Tent Cards are great for meetings, conferences, trade shows, or place cards.  We used these at a recent dinner that was more of a buffet style.  They worked very well and added a real professional touch.  It was an easy way to identify the food (although if you want much more information on the card, like an ingredient list, you would need to use a bigger tent card.  Avery also offers them in a large size or a medium size that might be better for your situation.  It really depends on the amount of content you want to place on the cards.  The small tent cards are likely best for name place cards, either for a dinner or meeting/conference.Setup and printing was super simple, which is something I always love about Avery products.

"The Netgear N300 Wi-Fi Router with High Powered Antennas offers very good range, good speeds, and has a small footprint.  Many of the routers you see today are fairly large, but the N300 is a good size. The antennas are fairly long offering higher power and range.Setup is pretty painless.  After about 15-20 minutes you'll easily have it up and going.  Additional time might be required if you have a large number of devices in your home or office.  The WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) offers you the ability to configure most devices to connect to the N300 with the simple push of a button.  I've always found WPS to work very well and the N300 was no different.  There is also an option to save power by scheduling the Wi-Fi to be off.  It appeared to work fine, but wasn't something I was interested in, as I have so many devices and typically they need access at one time or another.  But it's certainly a handy feature that you don't see in many routers.The N300 offers adequate speeds, although there are faster and more full featured (for instance, dual band) if you have the need and devices in your network that would benefit from it.  However, the N300 is an excellent value.  The user interface was good, although not nearly as perfect as I'm used to with most Netgear products.  Overall, it's a nice router and it's easy to setup.  It offers simplicity over high end features and is a great option for many people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SG3Q8GFRZMKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJYEI#wasThisHelpful","R2SG3Q8GFRZMKY","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Delkin 64GB microSDXC Memory Card performs very well, on par with similar cards.  When needing a high performance memory card for your camera, you want it perform day in and day out.  After using the Delkin 64GB microSDXC card with a GoPro Hero4, I can say that I am very pleased.  As a longtime SanDisk fan, the Delkin replaced a similar SanDisk model in terms of specs.Delkin is a good brand, I just never knew they produced memory cards.  I've used several of their other products with my SLR cameras, but I was confident that Delkin would provide a good product in memory cards as well.  The microSDXC didn't let me down.  I was able to get plenty of coverage on the GoPro without a hiccup.  Transfer speeds back to the computer were equally impressive.  While I won't comment much on price or value, I'll say that similar Sandisk cards performed in similar fashion at a lower price point.  So the price might be because of the Delkin name or possibly the longer life of the product that they are advertising (rugged, durable, etc).I cannot knock the Delkin card.  It performed very well and the casing does seem a bit more durable than competing brands.  I put trust in the Delkin name.

"Dr. Brandt's Do Not Age Transforming Pearl Serum delivers a noticeable difference, both in feel and looks.  While it can be hard to justify the pricing of some of these products, I cannot judge this serum on price, and will only examine the results.  First, the packaging felt like it was an expensive product.  It was well packaged and felt like a product that is high end.The serum itself was a little thin, but was easy to apply and did not linger.  So it wasn't something that you would easily get into your eyes or clothing.  The packaging felt more luxurious than the serum itself.  The thinness and overall appeal of it wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't something that felt like a million bucks.  However, within a short amount of time you could really feel a difference.  You really do get a feeling of firmness or tightening soon after application.The bigger question is whether there are noticeable visual results.  While examining the visual results of products like this usually takes a more long term approach I can safely say that I have noticed some difference.  There was a noticeable smoothness in some areas, but I would imagine minimizing wrinkles take more time to see a difference.So far I have not had any reactions or negative side effects.  Everything has been on the positive side.  There wasn't an overwhelming scent and so far the product has been going a long way.  It seems like it only takes a little bit during application, so a bottle of the serum should last a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWGGJ23AXEHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBBK5HG#wasThisHelpful","RTWGGJ23AXEHA","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Avery has been coming out with a large number of products lately.  It's not just labels anymore.  They have a large selection of marketing products and the Door Hangers with Tear-Away Cards are an excellent example of a great product.  Whether it's for a small business, a nonprofit, political campaign, or just about anything else, these door hangers are quick and simple to use that will provide a marketing edge for you.The door hangers are simple to design, as are most Avery products.  While you can get going quickly, I'd recommend taking your time and designing a very professional layout.  The best part of the door hangers are the tear-away cards.  Great for coupons, promotions, or contact info, it's just another way that your promotion will look professional.At 80 per pack, I think the price is very reasonable.  The count per pack also gives you the ability to play around a little bit and have enough to make a great promotion.  This is one of the best Avery solutions I've seen.

"The APC Dual USB Slim Portable Power Pack is very versatile, holds plenty of charge, and is great on the go or for emergencies.  At 10,000 mAh, there is plenty of power to go around.  While it can charge a tablet, it can also provide up to four charges for a cell phone.  I've always kept the smaller ""stick"" styles in my briefcase, but this APC power pack is now moving into the frontrunner spot.The power pack is light enough to slip into a briefcase and not be very noticeable.  It's very portable and is handy to have around, as you never know when you'll need a phone charge and don't have quick access to an outlet.  This is also a great unit to keep around for emergencies, maybe in an emergency kit.

It can really save room in your wallet.Like most Avery products, they are fairly simple to design and print.  Plenty of instructions, templates, and options.

"The Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi AC1900 Range Extender was very easy to setup and it offers an excellent range to connect up additional devices in your home or business.  I've grown to really like Netgear wireless products, mostly for their ease of use.  While they have options for additional configurations and advanced setups, the installations out of the box are usually a snap.If you have a wireless router with WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), most of setup will simply involve pressing a couple of buttons.  Setting up the equipment and taking care of configuration shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes or so, but possibly longer if you are not using WPS.  I live in a two story home, with my wireless router placed in one corner of the home on the second floor.  Wireless connections were spotty at the opposite end of the house, especially on the lower floor, but after installing the extender I was receiving excellent coverage.  Actually, I now have great coverage in my backyard as well, although that may not be desired for some buyers.I was able to roam my house with existing connected devices and not lose connections or much signal strength.  So far I've been very pleased with the extender and haven't experienced any issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YE0IU34EG8MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CLD6#wasThisHelpful","R1YE0IU34EG8MT","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-LINK Archer T8E AC1750 Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter offers great speed, compatibility, and signal.  First, the adapter is fairly compact and should be in most desktop computers without hassle.  I have several desktop PCs serving as media centers and upgraded one of them with the TP-LINK adapter.  I was instantly getting better speeds and signal quality.For installation, I used the provided disc, but you could always opt for downloading updated drivers.  It's hard to knock the device, as I've had zero trouble.  The installation was super simple, the speeds have been great, and I haven't experienced any network issues.  I've been streaming HD video and copying large files without hassle.  Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7WY51G41136/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL4A314#wasThisHelpful","R1X7WY51G41136","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DII Oceanique Shower Curtain is a nice, although fairly average curtain.  My initial opinion before opening it up was pretty good.  It was a neutral color and pattern and looked soft.  After opening it up, the only thing that changed was the appearance of softness.  Of course, it is 100% polyester and because of this I think it will be easy to clean and maintain.The size was a standard 72x72 and fit perfectly.  The pattern and color (cool brown) were certainly neutral so it would work for almost any bathroom.  The pattern isn't as noticeable until you get closer to the curtain.  It came out of the package with only a few wrinkles.  Since it is a dark color not as much light came through, but that wasn't a problem in my bathroom.  The thickness was pretty good.  Overall, I felt that it had a good quality and could work in almost any design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RK618BJA09ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME4GRMU#wasThisHelpful","R1RK618BJA09ID","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider myself to be an amateur photographer, by no means a professional, but proficient in most areas.  Having owned several DSLR cameras, I've always wanted a kit like the Delkin DDSS-SCOPE3 SensorScope System.  I'm usually very careful when swapping lenses out to minimize debris getting to the camera's internals and sensor.  However, no matter how careful you are there will be dust and small particles that get in and in many cases it might be larger, more noticeable dirt.A couple of years ago I took my camera to a camera shop and they had a similar setup to this system, but they clearly knew more about what they were doing.  So I admit, I was a bit timid at trying the Delkin system out.  Fortunately, I found the step by step guide that was included to be thorough enough to ease my worries.  I would consider the kit to be fairly complete, with not just the scope but a fair amount of solution, swabs/wands, pen, and vacuum.  For some this might be overkill and you might be better off buying the individual pieces that you need.  However, I find this kit to be well documented and fully prepared.The lights on the sensor provide amble lighting and there is good magnification to see what you are doing.  The vacuum is a nice touch and while it's fairly light in power, you don't really expect or need much.  There are also several wands, enough for multiple cleanings, as well as an adequate amount of solution.Overall, I'm very pleased.  For a first timer when it comes to cleaning my DSLR, I was very comfortable using the products and feel like I can use the system again as needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGPEUNUH3YRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055IAF0M#wasThisHelpful","RQGPEUNUH3YRX","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Thunderbolt 2 Dock, an excellent Elgato product, is a great way to clean up cord cutter and be able to sit down at your desk and not have to worry about hooking up a bunch of cables.  The market seems to flooded with these docks lately, but that's good as it gives us plenty of choices.The Elgato dock features a decent selection of ports, including HDMI, a three USB ports (yes, all of them are USB3), Ethernet, microphone, headphone jack, and two thunderbolt ports.  I really wish more of these dock manufacturers would add additional USB ports and while I was going to knock the Elgato for it, three is pretty decent but more importantly they are all USB3.  I know I could always attach a USB hub if I needed more, but if there was one improvement that would be it.  Otherwise, the Elgato dock performs wonderfully.Getting up and going was simple and straightforward.  I had some video issues, but I think that was mostly on my end.  Having tried many different docks, both on the PC and MAC side, video issues are normally the number one problem.  The overall design of the dock is nice and sleek.  All of the ports are pointed the same direction (makes the cord clutter appear a little less messy), and the footprint of the dock is relatively small.  Overall, it's been performing very well and I haven't experienced any connectivity issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106PUL2KKBW4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAPMSLE#wasThisHelpful","R106PUL2KKBW4O","A10Y058K7B96C6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10Y058K7B96C6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this since it came out and cannot get enough of it. I use it everyday for streaming YouTube videos and also live streaming games on my TV. It is relatively inexpensive compared to Roku or Apple TV and very easy to setup. Even if you are a beginner, it wouldn't take you more than 5 mins to set up. You can also cast things from multiple devices such as a PC or tablet.What I love most is that it doesn't consume battery on the smartphone so you can turn off the screen after you have initiated the streaming.It doesn't support any local storage media directly so the only way to do it is by connecting the storage media to your PC and stream from there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDFGTJ6WFR3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR0PDNE#wasThisHelpful","RBDFGTJ6WFR3D","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cooler Master Hyper 212+ is one of the most popular heatsinks of all time and it provides excellent performance for its value.  If you can't afford to purchase a premium air or water cooler then the Hyper 212+ is the best heatsink money could buy. Most high-end heatsinks are priced above $70+ while this beast goes for around $30. Also, you also have a high risk of a water cooler leaking and completely destroying your other components.Installing it is a piece of cake and the instructions are very easy to follow in case if you have never installed a heatsink before.There are also videos on YouTube that you could watch that show step by step of how to install a heatsinnk.The performance of this heatsink is excellent. I installed this heatsink to my 3770K CPU and temps were running 43C idle with stock heatsink. After applying the Hyper 212+, the temps dropped to 34C idle so that's a big difference and I have a lot of headroom for overclocking. I plan on overclocking my 3770K to 4.4Ghz but I need to do more testing for that.It comes with a 120mm fan attached pre-installed onto the heatsink and the metal clips make it very easy to remove the fan for heatsink. You also have an extra two metal clips in case you would want to add a second fan for more airflow. When it comes to noise, this beast is very quiet and does a good job at staying quiet even under full load. The Hyper 212+ comes with its own thermal paste which is decent but not the best one out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWY8CJC68UBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002G1YPH0#wasThisHelpful","R1EWY8CJC68UBK","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would like to thank Netgear for sending me this Wireless-N router (FVS318N) as part of the Friends and Family program. I’ve been using this product for a few days now and so far I've been impressed with the features and quality of the product. I have taken a couple of pictures to show you guys the packaging and the product itself so make sure to check them out!-Physical Specifications/FeaturesThe FVS318N is basically an improved version of the FVS318G that was released back in 2009. Netgear has improved the FVS318N by not just adding new features but by also adding new wireless capabilities and increasing performance. With that being said, the FVS318N is physically the same as the FVS318G. It is 7.5"" wide x 4.9"" length x 1.4"" high and weighs 1.3 lbs.The old version of this router that was release in 2009 had a 250Mhz processor, 32MB of ram and 8MB of flash but the new model sports a 300Mhz processor, 128MB of RAM and 32MB of flash. When it comes to cooling, the FVS318N is passively cooled so it's dead silent.Most routers come with four ports but the FVS318N comes with a nice 8 Gigabit Ethernet ports and also supports IPv6. The FVS318G didn't have jumbo frames but it seems like Netgear has added it to the 318N and according to Netgear, the 318N supports up to 9720 byte frames. After a quick research about the jumbo frames on the 318N, it seems that jumbo frames are only supported on ports 1 through 4 so that's a bit of a disappointment that it only works on half the ports. The FVS318N has a single band 802.11b/g/n radio and can be configured to run four separate SSIDs.-SetupAfter installing the router, I had an issue connecting to the ISP because it wouldn't pull an IP address without cloning the computer MAC. The menu structure is pretty straight forward and easy to understand but one thing that I noticed is that when rebooting the router, it takes a good 2+ minutes for the router to become resposinve again. Also, the menu seems to lag quite a bit and you have to wait a couple of seconds for the menu to refresh after applying the configurations. This becomes very annoying when you are trying to troubleshoot something.-ConclusionThis router has many professional features that are nice such as the 8 Gigabit LAN ports with jumbo frames. The router is only 802.11n and only single channel. However, it is more expensive compared to the Cisco RV120W which has a higher performance. The 318N goes for $170 while the RV120W sells for $130. Overall, it's a decent router and also, don't forget that all Netgear ProSafe devices come with a lifetime warranty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXSLCUS2MMBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ORP1JO#wasThisHelpful","R1EXSLCUS2MMBD","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would like to thank Netgear for sending me this Powerline 500Mbps adapter kit (XAVB5201) as part of the Friends and Family program. I’ve been using this product for a few days now and so far I’m very impressed with the quality and speed of the product. I have taken a couple of pictures to show you guys the packaging and the product itself so make sure to check them out!-Physical Specifications/PackagingOpening the box, you will find two Powerline 500 adapters nicely wrapped in a plastic bag and two 2 m (6.5 ft) Ethernet cables. There’s also a quick installation guide that can come in handy if you need help setting it up. The dimensions of this Powerline 500 adapter kit are 70 (H) x 51 (W) x 25 (D) mm and weighs 68 grams so it’s pretty small and light.I have a medium sized two-story house and my router is on the first floor near my living room. I have a smart TV in my living room which easily connects to my router and never drops a single connection. However, I have a second smart TV in my room which is in on the second floor and it’s all the way in the corner of the house. There are a lot of walls upstairs so my smart TV and my Galaxy S4 have a hard time keeping a stable connection and they sometimes randomly disconnect which can be very annoying. Not only that, but watching YouTube videos is a pain since I have to wait for it to buffer for a couple of minutes.-Setup/InstallationThis Powerline adapter kit couldn’t have come at a better time for me. I plugged it in an outlet on the second floor and used a long Ethernet cable that I had lying around and plugged it into my router. I didn’t need to configure or install new software which was very nice. It’s even got a ‘Pick-a-Plug’ LED which identifies the best outlet for optimal performance. The difference this kit has made is HUGE, no kidding. No more dropping connections and waiting for YouTube videos to buffer. My Galaxy S4 now easily has full bars and it hasn’t dropped a single connection since I started using this Powerline adapter kit. I can now use my Galaxy S4 if I’m in the attic which I wasn’t able to before.Here’s what I observed when testing my Galaxy S4 on speedtest.net with/without the Powerline kit.-My Room (Second Floor) without Powerline Kit:Signal Strength: One BarDownload Speed: 4.7 MbpsUpload Speed: 3.9 Mbps-My Room (Second Floor) with Powerline Kit:Signal Strength: Full BarsDownload Speed: 19.2 MbpsUpload Speed: 9.2 MbpsAs you can see, this kit has made a world of difference in downloading and uploading. I can now watch YouTube videos in HD without having to wait to buffer. That’s amazing! Another thing that I like about this Powerline kit is that when it’s not in use, it automatically powers down to save power.I highly recommend the Powerline 500Mbps adapter kit (XAVB5201) for anyone who has dead spots in their house or who just want to extend their wireless signal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIXEV556X2WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJY2U#wasThisHelpful","RXIXEV556X2WN","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pasting this review from my website but you will have to go to my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures in Amazon reviews. The link to my website is posted on the comments.Noctua has become one of the most popular companies in the cooling market and they have been constantly releasing top notch products one after another. Noctua has been getting a lot of positive attention for their superb fans and exceptional coolers and the color scheme is the reason why people recognize Noctua products when they see one.Noctua offers a six year warranty on their products and has possibly the best customer service out there and I can certainly vouch for that. They have always sent me replacements for fans and mounting kits free of charge and that was long before I became a reviewer. Noctua sets the perfect example of what a customer service should be like. To me, customer service is one of the most important aspects when deciding to purchase a product and that's why I praise Noctua's customer service in my reviews because they truly value their loyalty to their customers. A simple Google search will reveal how great Noctua's customer service is.Today we will be taking a look at the Noctua NH-C12P SE14 which is the successor to the classic NH-C12P that has won more than 100 awards and recommendations from the international press. The NH-C12P SE14 uses the same exact heatsink as the original NH-C12P and the only difference between the two of them is that the original heatsink used the NF-P12 (120mm) fan while the newer model uses the NF-P14 FLX (140mm) fan. That might not seem like a big change but the 140mm fan should be much more efficient at cooling the CPU since it's not only bigger but it also incorporates some unique fan design features that the 120mm model lacked. Another difference is that the original heatsink did not support the new Intel CPU sockets while the NH-C12P SE14 adds support for those sockets.The design of the NH-C12P SE14 is a little bit different to what we are used to seeing nowadays and it is referred to as the ""C-Type"" design. The NH-C12P SE14 is designed for applications where space is limited thus in order to cut down on height, the six copper heatpipes come out of the base and bend 180 degrees making the cooler only 114mm tall while still retaining all the great features that traditional coolers have such as the six heatpipe design, a whisper quiet fan and an easy mounting system.The link to my website is posted on the comments so visit my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures on reviews on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZVXUARTBLY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JME1CO#wasThisHelpful","RMZVXUARTBLY4","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have always sent me replacements for fans and mounting kits free of charge and that was long before I became a reviewer. Noctua sets the perfect example of what a customer service should be like.The other product that we will be taking a look at is the complete opposite of the NH-L9i. This is Noctua's largest CPU cooler that combines a massive six heatpipe dual tower design for extreme overclocking. We are talking about none other than the notorious NH-D14 that has won numerous awards for its exceptional performance. We will put the NH-D14 to the test to see how well it stacks up against other high end water coolers and air coolers.As you might have guessed from the name (-D14), this monster features a 14cm/140mm (NF-P14 FLX) fan that sits right in the middle of the two towers and also a 12cm/120mm (NF-P12) fan that sits on the side used in push/pull configuration. Similarly like the NH-L9i, this cooler also comes with SecuFirm 2 that makes installation a breeze.The packaging of the NH-D14 is also top notch. The accessories included in the box are excellent. Noctua has included mounting brackets needed to mount the cooler either on an Intel or AMD motherboard. They have also included a Phillips screw driver that you can use during the installation, two U.L.N.A. adapters which can be used to reduce fan speed for ultimate quietness, a manual is included as well and their amazing NT-H1 thermal compound.Moving on to the design of the NH-D14, we can see that this thing is huge compared to the NH-L9i. The NH-D14 weighs in at a hefty 900 grams without any fans and 1240 grams with both fans installed. That's over two pounds for a CPU cooler and it's a lot of weight for the motherboard to support. As you can see from the picture, this monster uses six 6 mm copper heatpipes and they have been soldered to the base plate and to the aluminium fins as well. The copper base plate measures 2 mm to 4.5mm thick and has a nickel-plated finish. Each stack has 42 aluminium fins and measures 0.4 mm thick and is approximately spaced 2 mm from the next.Something that many people probably don't know that I personally like about Noctua is that everything from fan design to bearing design is done in house. And this means that a lot of testing and R&D goes through when making a Noctua fan. Most manufactures simply use a stock model fan from an OEM and just slightly tweak the RPM levels and call it a day.Noctua puts a lot of R&D into their fan designs and it totally shows in the build quality of their fans. Typical fans don't last a long time; most fans come with a MTBF of 50,000 to 100,000 hours and most of them stop working before they even hit the limit; some even start to make high pitch noises.All the fans that Noctua designs come with a MTBF of more than 150,000 hours so they essentially pay for themselves in the future since you don't have to keep buying new fans if they stop working. Noctua also has an amazing customer service that I have always been very fond of. I have lost mounting kits numerous times and they have always sent me new ones free of charge. They have even sent me extra fans free of charge. I wish more companies had a customer service like Noctua! A simple Google search will reveal how great Noctua's customer service is.The fans that are used on the NH-D14 are the NF-P14 & NF-P12 and these are a little older fans than the one that's used on the NH-L9i. These fans use the first generation of SSO bearing. The NF-P14's max rotation speed is 1200 while the NF-P12 is 1300 RPM.If you decide to use the Ultra-Low-Noise-Adapter then the speed will drop to 900 RPM for both of them. These fans are whisper quiet even under full load and you will hardly hear them spinning. Noctua has discontinued the NF-P14 FLX because they have released the successor to that fan and that is the NF-A15 PWM fan.Installing the NH-D14 was relatively easy thanks to the SecuFirm2 mounting system that Noctua has greatly designed. SecuFirm2 is compatible with pretty much all AMD and Intel sockets. The whole assembly took less than 5 minutes and even if you are someone with no knowledge whatsoever, you will still be able to install this cooler with little to no effort thanks to SecuFirm2.SecuFirm 2 isn't compatible with Intel's 775 and 1366 sockets so you will need to contact Noctua so they can send you the necessary equipment free of charge. Noctua also promises to provide upgrade kits for future sockets free of charge which is also very nice!Since I'm using low profile RAM modules, I didn't have any problems with the cooler hanging over the RAM slots. If you are using RAM with tall heatsinks then you might need to do some calculations before purchasing the NH-D14.In my opinion, there's very little reason to purchasing RAM with tall heatsinks because RAM does not produce enough heat that you would need to dissipate it and there's no performance boost to having the tall heatsinks. I know some people like them for looks but you have to decide if you're one of those people. If you need help figuring out the RAM compatibility with the NH-D14 then head over to Noctua's website NH-D14 RAM Compatibility.Before I talk about the test methodology, I just want to say that since these two coolers are engineered for completely different purposes, we will be testing them differently from each other. We will be testing the NH-D14 with our regular system setup and that is with the 3770K overclocked to 4.6Ghz with using around 1.30 volts. This will be a good way to test this beast because we all know that Ivy Bridge runs super hot once overclocked and it really puts a lot of stress into any modern CPU cooler that's out there.All of the testing is done with an ambient temperature of ~24C. RealTemp will be used to monitor the temperature of the CPU and Prime95 (Large FFTs) will be used to deliver the full load to the CPU for 20 minutes.Idle temperatures will be measured after leaving the computer idle for 20 minutes. CPU-Z will be used to verify the CPU speed and the voltage being used in Windows 7. Also, the coolers are tested with the default settings (Turbo, C1E etc) enabled in the BIOS.We will measure the noise levels for both in idle and load using a dBA meter and point it at the computer at a distance of ~50 CM. It's always difficult to measure noise levels because there are always noises in the background which can affect it so the results may not be 100% precise but it should give you a clear indication of the noise levels for the cooler.One thing that I have to say before the test is that I'm using 1.30 volts for the overclock but you clearly don't need 1.30 volts to get the 3770K stable at 4.6Ghz but I'm doing this to stress test the cooler to its limits. You can easily get it stable with using ~1.24 volts and you will probably get much better temperatures than I did so keep that in mind.Visit my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures on reviews on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14SKEYHB73VX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VKVZ1A#wasThisHelpful","R14SKEYHB73VX1","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have always sent me replacements for fans and mounting kits free of charge and that was long before I became a reviewer. Noctua sets the perfect example of what a customer service should be like.The NH-L9i is Noctua's low profile heatsink designed to fit into small factor systems or HTPCs for Intel socket LGA115x (1155/1156/1150) processors only. Since it's designed to work only on Intel platforms, this makes for a super easy installation thanks to Noctua's SecuFirm 2 mounting system. It comes at a super low profile of only 37mm tall (23mm heatsink and 14mm NF-A9x14 low profile fan) that makes it extremely slim and ideal to use for mini ITX cases. It provides full compatibility with tall RAM modules and VGA cards on mini ITX mainboards.The NH-L9i is designed to replace stock cooling that comes with Intel CPUs and should theoretically eliminate overheating issues that you might have with the stock heatsink. The NH-L9i comes with a strict set of TDP guidelines and according to Noctua's website, it should be used with care on CPUs with more than 65W TDP.The packaging of the NH-L9i feels top notch and very sturdy. Just as you would expect with any Noctua product, the components inside are well packaged and everything feels well secured inside the box. The front of the box lists some of the features such as Full Memory Compatibility, compatibility with past and future sockets, 6 year warranty, PWM support, Low-Noise Adaptor, and the NT-H1 thermal compound.When opening up the package for the NH-L9i, you are presented with a high density foam that securely holds the NF-A9x14 PWM fan, NT-H1 thermal compound, Low-Noise-Adapter, four mounting screws, four screws, Noctua case sticker and a manual. Noctua has always done a fantastic job on their packaging and the packaging of the NH-L9i is no exception.Here we can see how the NH-L9i is constructed and that is with a copper base and heatpipes, aluminium fins, soldered joints and nickel plating. The dimension for the NH-L9i come in at 95 mm x 95 mm x 37 mm (L x W x H) for the heatsink which makes it perfect for mini ITX cases. The cooler weighs 345 g without the fan and 420 g with the fan installed. This might be a tiny cooler but it has two 6 mm heatpipes while Intel's stock cooler has none. You can't rely on Intel's stock cooler for anything because it's cheaply made and makes loud noises. Noctua engineers everything for quietness and puts a lot of R&D into their products, more on that on the next page. Something that many people probably don't know that I personally like about Noctua is that everything from fan design to bearing design is done in house. And this means that a lot of testing and R&D goes through when making a Noctua fan. Most manufactures simply use a stock model fan from an OEM and just slightly tweak the RPM levels and call it a day.Noctua puts a lot of R&D into their fan designs and it totally shows in the build quality of their fans. Typical fans don't last a long time; most fans come with a MTBF of 50,000 to 100,000 hours and most of them stop working before they even hit the limit; some even start to make high pitch noises.All the fans that Noctua designs come with a MTBF of more than 150,000 hours so they essentially pay for themselves in the future since you don't have to keep buying new fans if they stop working. Noctua also has an amazing customer service that I have always been very fond of. I have lost mounting kits numerous times and they have always sent me new ones free of charge. They have even sent me extra fans free of charge. I wish more companies had a customer service like Noctua! A simple Google search will reveal how great Noctua's customer service is.The NH-L9i comes with the NF-A9x14 PWM fan that spins at a maximum 2500 RPM, or 1800 RPM with the L.N.A. It uses Noctua's second generation SSO2 bearing with metal bearing shell and Noctua's custom designed PWM IC for fully automatic PWM speeds. The metal bearing shell is made from CNC milled brass that delivers long term stability and durability. The NF-A9x14 PWM fan can drop as low as 600 RPM via PWM mode. It comes at a 14mm thickness that makes it ideal for low profile CPU coolers.Installing the NH-L9i was relatively easy thanks to the SecuFirm2 mounting system that Noctua has greatly designed. SecuFirm2 is compatible with pretty much all AMD and Intel sockets. The whole assembly took less than 5 minutes and even if you are someone with no knowledge whatsoever, you will still be able to install this cooler with little to no effort thanks to SecuFirm2.SecuFirm 2 isn't compatible with Intel's 775 and 1366 sockets so you will need to contact Noctua so they can send you the necessary equipment free of charge. Noctua also promises to provide upgrade kits for future sockets free of charge which is also very nice!Visit my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures on reviews on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ZJN7B0DC47C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VY1PMI#wasThisHelpful","R23ZJN7B0DC47C","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pasting this review from my website but you will have to go to my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures in Amazon reviews. I posted the link in the comments because Amazon doesn't allow URLs in reviews.With so many great ATX motherboards being launched recently for Z87 chipset, it's easy to forget mATX boards like the Maximus VI Gene that is targeted at both overclockers and gamers. Like its predecessor, the Asus Z87 Maximus VI Gene is truly a fantastic board that has the capability of putting other higher end boards to shame. You would expect a mATX board like this to come with only a few SATAIII ports but ASUS has equipped this bad boy with eight SATAIII ports, sixteen USB ports (8x USB 3.0 and 8 USB 2.0), a ridiculous amount of headers especially for fans, amazing built in sound quality and much more. With Haswell being released, you really have to consider which motherboard best fits your needs. If all you are going to do is gaming and light overclocking then you don't really need a full ATX board. I'm seeing a lot of people purchase ATX boards just for gaming and browsing the internet which isn't very smart because a mATX board like the Maximus VI Gene will do all of those just fine and much more and you will save money in the end.The Z87 Maximus VI Gene sports the black and red color scheme that you would expect from the ROG series and it looks very attractive. Considering that this is only a mATX board, it comes with an endless amount of features for overclocking, fan customization and power saving options. I recently did a full review of the Z87-Pro which is a fantastic mid-range ATX board and was able to handle my 4770K at 4.8Ghz like a champ. I will put the link on the bottom of this review so you guys can check it out for yourself. If you guys want a full ATX board that has some of the features that higher end boards have, then I seriously recommend taking a look at the Z87-Pro because at $199.99, it becomes hard to beat.The Z87 Maximus VI Gene comes with the brand new AI Suite III which ASUS has improved quite a lot and they have done a fantastic job at making overclocking as easy as possible for people with less overclocking experience. I will be using the same test setup that I used to benchmark the Z87-Pro so we can see what this little beast is capable of. To fully stress test the motherboard, I will be overclocking the 4770K to 4.6Ghz to see how well it handles it. I will be using the new AI Suite III to overclock it because it makes overclocking much easier that what we are used to. With a single mouse click, AI Suite III is able to overclock my 4770K to  4.6Ghz with the correct settings and voltages.AI Suite III will automatically find the right settings, voltages and optimize the system to perform like it should with the new overclock. ASUS has completely redesigned the interface in AI Suite III which is easier to understand and follow and has also implemented a lot of new features that are very useful for overclockers. AI Suite III allows you to control every single part of your motherboard and even turn off some parts of the motherboard to conserve energy which can be quite useful if all you do is browse the internet and watch videos.I'm surprised at how ASUS has managed to pack so many awesome features in this mATX board which is mind blowing if you think about it. You get all the amazing features such as the new and improved UEFI BIOS making it super easy to navigate around in the BIOS, awesome built in sound quality, a ton of USB 3.0 ports and much more which I will talk about later. It has so many options that it can be overwhelming at first but after getting used to it, I literally fell in love with it. Haswell has really changed the traditional overclocking methods that we are all used to seeing and you really have to tweak a lot of settings in the BIOS to get the overclock you want which is why I recommend using AI Suite III because it makes this process extremely easy.+Packaging & Accessories:Like with any ASUS packaging, the packaging of the Z87 Maximus VI Gene is overall great. ASUS really knows how to securely protect the components inside the box during transit. The retail packaging feels sturdy and very attractive. Everything that you need to know about the motherboard is presented right in front of you. The color scheme on the box is a combination of black and red which is the same as it was on the Z77's version. The color scheme of the box is supposed to match the color scheme of the motherboard.On the center of the front cover, we have the name of the motherboard written in big white text. At the top left, we have the Republic of Gaming logo and on the bottom left we have the SLI and Crossfire sticker. There's not a whole lot of stuff on the front cover so let's move on to the back because that's where most of the information is. So on the top of the back cover, we have four little square boxes with images that show some of the features that come with this motherboard. First, there's the SupremeFX which if you remember was once a discrete audio card but it's now integrated into the motherboard so you can expect amazing sound quality. It uses ELNA premium Japan-made audio capacitors that provide immersive sound with exceptional clarity that are great for game effects and multimedia. Second is mPCIe Combo II and it can support socket M2 (NGFF) SSDs along with a Dual Band WiFi Bluetooth module. Third is Extreme Engine Digi+III and that is an upgraded VRM system designed by ROG for Haswell processors. It comes with all Maximus VI series motherboards. And the last one is SLI/CrossFireX which is pretty self-explanatory. Below these four little boxes, we have the all specifications of the motherboard listed out.When we open up the package, we can see that the motherboard is placed inside an anti-static bag for protection as you would expect from any motherboard manufacture. The motherboard itself is securely packaged and isn't going to shift during transit. ASUS has always done a fine job at making sure their motherboards are well secured inside the box. Beneath the motherboard, we will find the typical accessories that you would expect from any motherboard manufacture to include.Along with the motherboard, these are the accessories that you will find inside the package.* User's manual* Support DVD* I/O Shield* 1 x mPCIe Combo II expansion card* 3 x 2-in-1 SATA 6Gb/s cables* 1 x SLI bridge* 1 x 2-in-1 Q-Connector Kit* 1 x 12 in 1 ROG Cable Label* 1 x ROG Door Hanger+Build Quality / Design:The overall layout of the motherboard is excellent and the ROG color scheme looks attractive on the black PCB. There's plenty of room around the socket region to install even some of today's largest CPU coolers like the Noctua NH-D14. It comes with a stainless steel back I/O for great protection and extended motherboard lifespan. The build quality of the motherboard feels very sturdy when holding and very durable like with any ASUS motherboard.The Z87 Maximus VI Gene also offers a massive 8+2-phase power design for high overclocking, and best of all, there are 10K Black Metallic Capacitors rated for 10,000 hours at 105C. The 10K Black Metallic capacitors last five times longer and deliver 20% greater extreme temperature endurance than generic solid state capacitors. The Z87 Maximus VI Gene uses NexFET MOSFETs that can handle up to 90% efficiency under normal operation and better durability than the standard MOSFETs. The Z87 Maximus VI Gene is greatly designed to handle high volts really well even though it is a mATX board. The 8+2 phase power design is more than enough to get a 4770K to 4.6Ghz or even more with the correct cooling.The black metal heatsinks on the VRMs look great and you can feel that they are made with high quality materials. All of these great design features make the motherboard very attractive and the heatsinks are nice and big for better heat dissipation and improved cooling. This means it can handle more volts without overheating which will result in higher overclocking. On the back of the motherboard you will see that there are a few backplates where the VRMs are and this is to protect the circuitry and help with dissipating the heat. It also comes with a 3 year warranty which is very nice to have.+Ports / Features:The Z87 Maximus VI Gene comes with a whopping eight SATAIII ports and they are all 6Gb/s ports. Six of those SATA III ports are from the Z87 chipset and two of those are from the ASMedia 1061 controller. When using a M.2 slot on mPCIe Combo II, SATA port 5 will be disabled. Long gone are the days where you had only one or two SATAIII ports. The motherboard is SLI and Crossfire ready so you can stick two of your favorite cards in there and get awesome performance (they won't run at full x16 but instead at x8 which is still more than enough). You also have sixteen USB ports; eight are USB 3.0 ports via the Z87 chipset and eight more from ASMedia 1042 controller.Features such as USB 3.0 Boost, mPCIe Combo II, Fan Xpert and the new Dual Intelligent Processors 4 and 4-Way optimization are great features that can really improve the user's experience. It's little things like this that separates Asus from other companies in this industry and that's why I recommend Asus products to anyone who reads my reviews.The new AI Suite III offers automatic overclock, improved power efficiency, customized fan controls and optimized digital power delivery. All of these are unique features that can easily tweak your system without too much effort. It auto detects the best performance for your system which is great if you don't want to spend countless of hours into tweaking your system. You can even set the max power delivery for your system and it will try to not go over that limit which can be useful if you want to conserve electricity. You can enable the EPU mode and you will be instantly saving power and money without sacrificing performance. It can even shut down parts of your motherboard to save power and it can also improve the cooling of your system and reduce fan noise.The Z87 Maximus VI Gene comes with a total of four PCI-Express slots. Two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, one PCIe x4 slot and one mini-PCIe 2.0 x1 port. The board supports full x16 bandwidth but only with a single card. If you want to run dual GPUs, it will run at x8/x8 and triple card setup isn't possible. The Z87-Pro that I reviewed recently offered a triple card configuration at x8/x8/x4 which can be great for people who want to run that many cards. I personally have never run more than two cards because it's just not worth it in my option. Drivers are usually not optimized for more than two cards and don't scale very well and games don't fully utilize beyond two cards and sometimes applications randomly crash. Also, something to note about the Z87 Maximus VI Gene is that there are no PCI slots which might disappoint some people. I personally like that it doesn't have any PCI slots because it can take up precious space in the motherboard and they have become so outdated and slow nowadays.It comes with four DDR3 DIMM slots supporting up to 32GB of ram in dual channel mode and can even support ram up to 2800Mhz-3000Mhz if you can overclock it. The motherboard comes with a debug LED which can be very useful if something goes wrong when installing a new hardware. The LED display on the board will give you an error code which then you can use to look up what the problem is. The LED display is always on and when there isn't an error, it displays the BIOS version. This feature can be quite handy when troubleshooting new hardware and really easy to figure out what exactly is not working properly. I congratulate ASUS for implementing an awesome feature like this because it can really help people like me that are constantly upgrading their hardware. Also, the southbridge has two additional heatsinks with a small heatpipe in the middle of them. ASUS really knows how to cool them southbridges!An excellent feature that Asus has implemented into their boards is the USB BIOS Flashback button. You can use this to flash the BIOS without having to boot the system into the UEFI BIOS which makes it much easier. There's no need to have a CPU, memory, or GPU installed in the motherboard to update your BIOS. You simply plug in a USB drive with the correct BIOS file into the lower USB 3.0 port underneath the LAN port and press the button for 3 seconds until the integrated LED begins to flash. While the BIOS is updating, the LED flashing frequency increases letting you know that it's still working. When the LED stops flashing, the flash operation is completed and the board can be booted. With the USB BIOS Flashback feature, it's impossible to brick your board!Back I/O Ports* 1x ROG Connect Button* 1x Clear CMOS Button* HDMI Port* LAN (RJ45) port* 6x USB 3.0 (blue)* 4x USB 2.0 (black)* Optical S/PDIF out* 6x Audio jack(s)Internal I/O Ports* 1x USB 3.0 connector supports additional 2 USB 3.0 ports* 2x USB 2.0 connectors support additional 4 USB 2.0 ports (1 connector shares with ROG_EXT header)* 1x ROG extension (ROG_EXT) header* 8x SATA 6Gb/s connectors* 1x CPU fan connectors for smart DC/PWM mode control* 1x CPU optional fan connector* 3x Chassis fan connectors* 1x 24-pin EATX power connector* 1x 8-pin EATX 12V power connector* 10x ProbeIt measurement points* 1x LN2 Mode jumper* 1x Power-on button* 1x Reset button* 1x DirectKey button* 1x MemOK!

With the new AI Suite III, you have pretty much control over your entire motherboard and when I say you have control over your entire motherboard, I really mean it. When using AI Suite III, you are presented with five sections at the top and each one does its specific thing. You have the option of putting your computer in power saving mode to reduce as much electricity as possible or set it to high performance to get the most out of your computer. You can customize your fan speeds for silent mode, automatically/manually overclock your CPU and many more which I'll explain into details below.When you first open up AI Suit III, the first section that you will see is the 4-Way Optimization section and this deals mostly with automatic overclocking, optimizing fan speed and power savings options. At the bottom of this section, we can see our current CPU frequency, Dram frequency, the voltage for each core, temperature of the CPU/Motherboard and how fast each fan in your case is running at. Also, on the side you have four power saving modes, Auto, High Performance, Max Power Saving and Away Mode. This section will mostly display the settings your current components are running at; you can't really tweak anything here.Moving over to the second section, we have the TPU section and this is where you will be spending most of your time tweaking your CPU settings and overclocking it. Here we have adjustable settings for BCLK, CPU Ratio, CPU Cache Ratio, Voltages and CPU Cache. Overclocking has never been this easy and Asus has done a fantastic job at improving their software. I know some of the earlier versions of AI Suit had some glitches but it seems like Asus has fixed all of them. I remember one glitch in the earlier version of AI Suit where it would report a different CPU temperature than what it actually was in the BIOS. There is also a checkbox called Group Tuning that allows for adjusting each core individually or all cores at once. On the side of this section, we have four cylinders which each one represents each core of the CPU. You can also overclock each core differently if you like and it will show you using the cylinder. There is a subsection in the TPU section marked CPU Strap where you can change the CPU Strap to 100, 125, 167, and 250. At the bottom of this section, we can see the sensors for voltages, temperatures and fan speeds. Everything in the software feels well designed and very easy on the eyes.The third section is the EPU section and this is specifically designed for power saving options. There are four subsections in the EPU section, Auto, High Performance, Max Power Saving and Away Mode. You have the option to set the voltage decrement to either auto or manual. You can also undervolt the CPU to conserve as much energy as possible. I know many people who undervolt their CPUs because they simply don't need all that power when browsing the internet so this is an outstanding feature in the new AI Suit III. You can control your monitor sleep time, computer sleep, fan profiles and you can even turn off the USB controller power if a device is not attached to save as much energy as possible. I love the option of turning off the fans when doing light tasks such as browsing the internet or watching movies. I could hardly hear the system running when I turned off most of the fans in my system.The fourth section is the Digi+Power Control section and here you have two subsections, one for CPU and for RAM. The CPU section contains settings for load-line calibration, CPU Power Phase Control which can be set to either: Standard, Optimized, Extreme or Manual Adjustment. You also have CPU Current Capability, CPU Power Thermal Control, Voltage Frequency, CPU Power Duty Control and Active Frequency Mode which can be set to either OFF or ON. There are so many options in this section that you can play around with and get awesome overclocks. The memory subsection has adjustable settings for DRAM Current Capability, DRAM Voltage Frequency and DRAM power phase control. You can overclock your RAM with literally one mouse click and you don't have to constantly reboot into BIOS and keep tweaking the settings.The fifth section is the Fan Xpert 2 section which is probably one my favorite feature of the AI Suite III because you have pretty much control over every single fan in your case, from the CPU fan to each individual case fans. You have four profiles to choose from when you click the Fan Xpert 2 section, Silent, Standard, Turbo and Full Speed. You can set the fan in `silent' mode if you are doing light tasks such as watching YouTube videos or browsing the internet and you won't even hear the computer running. If you are going to be playing intensive games such as BF3, Crysis 3 or Metro LL then consider choosing a different fan profile. There is also a fan curve customization for the CPU fan which you can play around with so you can make your own profile and it will automatically adjust its speed which is what I did.+BIOS:As soon as you boot into BIOS, you are presented with a simple (EZ Mode) and advanced mode. The BIOS has full support for both keyboard and mouse and it's designed in a way that both first time users and advanced users can jump right in and start tweaking. The EZ Mode is targeted at people who have little to no experience with overclocking and has very few little options that you can play around with. With the release of Haswell, Asus has expanded its functionality by adding XMP memory control and the ability to select pre-defined fan profiles. Overclocking your RAM has literally gotten so easy that even a caveman can do it.The UEFI BIOS comes loaded with a ton of amazing features that you could ever want in a BIOS. My first favorite feature of the BIOS is the option of writing quick notes while you are in the BIOS for future references. I can imagine this being useful to pretty much everyone because this makes it so much easier to remember what you have to do when you get in the BIOS. There is a quick note button on the right side of the screen which will bring up a text box where you can write notes so it's pretty easy to access.You can take notes of the results you get when overclocking and compare them with the previous results and you know they will be in a safe place and not get lost. I can safely say that Asus has possibly the best UEFI BIOS out of all the manufactures in this industry. There's so many things that I like about the BIOS but a cool little feature that Asus has created is that now you can take screenshots within the BIOS by pressing F12 and it will save the screenshot in your USB in a bitmap format at 1024x768 resolution.My second favorite feature of the BIOS is the new `Favorites' screen which allows you to add any BIOS option to the screen for fast and easy access. There is also a last modified button which will show you the last modified changes that you made to the BIOS which is very useful because if something goes horribly wrong or is not working like it should, you can go back and easily fix it. Another neat little feature that Asus has made to the BIOS is that when you are about to save your settings and prepared to exit, it will show you all the changes you are about to make which can be useful just in case you make a mistake.Another very useful feature for people who reboot hundreds of times a day when overclocking/tweaking is the new ASUS Boot Setting. This allows you to boot directly into the BIOS without having to press delete repeatedly on the POST screen. I'm one of those OCD people who reboots into the BIOS at least 20 times a day (I'm dead serious) and this is probably the smartest feature that Asus has created for overclocking geeks like me. This will save me a ton of time when I go back into the BIOS and start tweaking stuff.+Test System:I will be using the same test setup that I used to benchmark the Z87-Pro so let's get right to it. I did a clean Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64bit format on my Samsung 840 Pro 256GB SSD and made sure nothing was running in the background while I was doing the benchmarks. All the components will be inside the enormous Corsair 900D which offers great performance for both air cooling and water cooling setups. I'm using the Kingston HyperX Beast (2x8GB) 16GB at 2133Mhz which is very fast and the Samsung 840 Pro 256GB which is one of the fastest SSDs in the market right now.All the benchmarks below have been made with the 4770K at 4.6Ghz and then some of the other benchmarks are done with the GTX Titan and the Intel iGPU since I don't have any other dedicated GPUs in my house to test it against.  The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000W will be used to power everything that you see below. Also, Noctua fans will be used instead of the stock H100i fans for the radiator and the case fan since they are quieter and overall much better.* Test System:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770KPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston HyperX Beast 16GBSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBCooling: Corsair H100iMB: ASUS Z87 Maximus VI GeneOS: Windows 7 64bit SP1+Benchmarks:I will be doing the same benchmarks that I did to the Z87-Pro on the Z87 Maximus VI Gene motherboard so we can see how well it performs. First, I will start with the boot times since that's obviously very important. After having installed all the drivers and done all the windows updates, the boot times were approximately the same as the Z87-Pro, under 8 seconds which is incredibly quick.+Boot Time using Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64bit: ~7 seconds----------------------------------------------------------------------------Another test that people have requested me do on my previous reviews is benchmarking the performance of the SATAIII controller. SATAIII has become the standard nowadays and while it is slowly become saturated by newer SSDs; it is still more than enough to drive an SSD to its full limits. I will be using the Samsung 840 Pro 256GB which is one of the fastest SSDs your money can buy to measure how fast the SATAIII controller is on the Asus Z87 Maximus VI Gene. The software that I will be using is CrystalDiskMark which is a very useful benchmarking tool that's used to measure the speed of a drive based on Sequential, 512K and 4K read and write tests.As you can see from the results below, I got very impressive scores. Very close to what I got with the Z87-Pro and in some cases better.+SATAIII: CrystalDiskMark (Samsung 840 Pro 256GB):---------------------Read ----------- WriteSequence: 531.2MB/sec --- 498.6MB/sec512K: 498.8MB/sec -------510.1MB/sec4K: 39.78MB/sec -----------85.35MB/sec4K QD32: 398.1MB/sec -----337.87MB/sec----------------------------------------------------------------------------Moving on, testing the speed of the USB 3.0 controller on the Asus Z87 Maximus VI Gene was done by using the ""Orico 6619US3-BK Super Speed USB3.0"" which converts your SSD/HDD to a USB 3.0. I have a couple of these at home that I use regularly and they are quite useful. The drive inside was the exact same that I used before, Samsung 840 Pro 256GB and once again, the results were very similar to what I got on the Z87-Pro. I'm very impressed with the results.+USB 3.0: CrystalDiskMark (Samsung 840 Pro 256GB):---------------------Read ----------- WriteSequence: 498.7MB/sec --- 459.7MB/sec512K: 456.4MB/sec -------482.7MB/sec4K: 29.13MB/sec -----------46.86MB/sec4K QD32: 93.5MB/sec -----155.79MB/sec---------------------------------------------------------------------------+Overclocking:Haswell has brought different overclocking methods and challenges that are different from what we are used to. Now, we all know that Ivy Bridge CPUs run hot but Haswell runs even hotter due to having the VRMs on-die so you can no longer rely on a stock Intel cooler to cool your CPU. Many people have been switching to high end water cooling setups to achieve reasonable overclocks. If you have a good closed liquid cooler such as the H100i or an air cooler like the NH-D14 then you should be able to get high overclocks very easily.Asus has done an excellent job of providing users with as many options for people that like to tweak every single component on their machines to get the best possible performance. You can either overclock manually by go into the BIOS which can get a bit tiresome or use the brand new AI Suite III which makes it a lot easier. The AI Suite III makes it extremely easy for people that just want to overclock their CPU and not waste countless hours trying to tweak other settings and figuring out what's causing BSODs and things of that nature. With a single mouse click, the AI Suite III automatically optimizes your CPU for the best overclock your system can handle and you never have to look back. I personally know many people that would love to have this feature and don't want to sit in their BIOS all day to test each setting individually.For this test, I'm going to use AI Suit III because with one mouse click, it overclocked my CPU to 4.6Ghz and it was fully stable. I used Prime95 for 30 minutes to test the stability of the CPU and I only needed 1.21volts for it to be fully stable. Temps are also great on the Z87 Maximus VI Gene and it never exceeds 75C which is awesome. I could have easily gone for 4.8Ghz and this motherboard would have had no problems handling it but my Corsair H100i wouldn't have been able to keep the temps down. I did test it and the temps went through the roof, well over 90C so I had to dial it back a bit.Moving along, here are some of the benchmarks that I did to test the performance of the motherboard. Everything has been tested with the 4770K overclocked at 4.6Ghz using 1.21volts/1920x1080.+Cinebench 11.5:CPU: 9.98 - (Multi-Threaded)CPU: 2.11 - (Single-Threaded)OpenGL: 89.46fps - (iGPU)+PCMark 8 Work: 5609+PCMark 8 Home: 6165+PCMark 7 Computation: 8659+PCMark 7 Storage: 5276+PCMark 8 Vantage Productivity: 40146+PCMark 8 Vantage Gaming: 30725+wPrime 32M: 7.043+wPrime 1024M: 176.532+3DMark 11 Physics: 12559+3DMark Fire Strike Physics: 41.05+3DMark Cloud Gate Physics: 31.66+3DMark Ice Storm Physics: 203.86----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+x264 HD Video Encoding v5.0.1:This is a popular benchmark that measures how fast your machine can encode a short HD quality video clip into a high quality x264 video file. Make sure to enable ""Sync all cores"" in the UEFI BIOS to get the accurate score because at first I was using the XMP profile and I was getting very low scores and after enabling it, everything was good.1st pass: 83.87fps2nd pass:19.76fps---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+All the games below are tested at max settings at 1920x1080.

If you are someone who's looking to build a small gaming machine that still has the overclocking potential of a full ATX board then the Z87 Maximus VI Gene is for you. The SupremeFX does an outstanding job at delivering outstanding sound quality. It may not have all the features that some of the extreme boards have but very few people use every feature that comes with the motherboard. You cannot run triple card setup with this motherboard because there are only two PCIe 3.0 slots but again, very few people run more than one or two cards at the same time. The black and red color scheme looks very attractive and the board design looks top notch as you would expect from any ASUS motherboard.AI Suite III makes overclocking on this motherboard so easy that even a caveman can do it. It literally takes one click and you are done. The 4-Way Optimization in the new AI Suite III is great for people who don't want to bother with going into the BIOS and tweaking each setting. The Z87 Maximus VI Gene has nice and strong VRMs (8+2 phase design) that can handle high volts really well (1.4v+). I was able to get my 4770K to 4.6Ghz and it handled it fine. I'm also using a closed liquid cooler (H100i) that can handle high temperatures very well. AI Suite III will automatically tune your system for the best performance without you having to go into the BIOS and playing with each individual setting. If you plan on upgrading to a Haswell CPU and are looking for a motherboard that will offer you plenty of overclocking options, then the Z87 Maximus VI Gene might be for you.The new and improved UEFI BIOS is probably the best out of all motherboards that I have seen. The amount of SATAIII and USB 3.0 ports is mind-blowing. I know many people who have a lot of devices connected to their computer and this motherboard offers you all of that. Boot times, SATAIII and USB 3.0 performance is very good with this motherboard. This board has everything you can ask for in a mATX board and more. The UEFI BIOS is friendly and has an enormous amount of options that can be overwhelming at first but give it a few tries and you will fall in love with it. You can write quick notes while you are in the BIOS for future references which can very useful and the ""Favorite"" option is also very good if you want to customize it with the settings that you use the most to get quick access to everything.The ASUS Z87 Maximus VI Gene retails for $209.99 (Amazon) and it does cost a little bit more than other mATX motherboards out there but it also has a ton of mind-blowing features that I personally cannot live without. ASUS has always made amazing ATX motherboards and the Z87 Maximus VI Gene is possibly one of the best mATX boards that I have ever tested. This is a very attractive looking motherboard that doesn't disappoint in any area. I'm seeing a lot of people on forums who are constantly buying full ATX boards just for gaming and they don't even use half of the features that it comes with so I think more people should buy mATX boards because they are just as","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJ6MF6YKD9V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRJUGTC#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJ6MF6YKD9V3","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before I start my review I just want to say that I'm not a crazy Facebook user and I usually log into my Facebook once a week or so. I rarely ever use Facebook and when I do, I usually just see what's new with my friends/family and then immediately log out. I got this phone for my girlfriend because she (obviously) loves Facebook so I thought it would be cool to buy her a phone that's made for Facebook users in mind. The HTC First is also known as the ""Facebook phone"" and it isn't a high end device by any means and it's geared towards users who love Facebook and aren't tech savvy.  The launcher that's running on top of Android 4.1 is called Facebook Home. You can also disable Facebook Home that comes right out of the box and use the stock android version which is android 4.1 Jelly Bean. This is a cool feature that this phone offers because some people might later decide to use the stock android version if they get bored with Facebook Home.So far from all the testing that I have done, the HTC First has a decent battery life which I wasn't expecting it because it's a mid-range device. It packs a 2000 mAh battery that it's more than enough for people who spent most of their time on Facebook. The screen on the HTC First is 720p which is great for viewing pictures or HD videos. The HTC First is a 4.3 inches device that is perfect for my girlfriend because she has small hands - she's coming from an iPhone 4S. I made her ditch the iPhone 4S and come to Android. :D The HTC First comes with Snapdragon 400 which is a dual core CPU that runs at 1.4Ghz. It has no problems handling everything you throw at it and consumes very little power when it's running; qualcomm really knows how to make great chips.Pros:+Display / Screen:The screen is bigger on the HTC First (4.3 inches) than the iPhone 4S so viewing pictures or watching videos is better on the HTC First. The screen resolution is also much sharper on the HTC First and has more pixel density than the iPhone 4S. The resolution on this phone is 720 x 1280 (342ppi pixel density) which if you compare it to the iPhone 4S is way better.+Android OS:This phone ships with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) which is blazing fast and never lags. If you decide to use the Facebook Home mode then you have quick access to all the Facebook stuff such as the Facebook app, messenger and instagram. You can also access all of your applications if you swipe to the left as soon as you get in the app drawer and you get all of your typical apps that come included in all android devices.+Design:The design is just like any HTC phone you have seen before. It has a nice soft touch when you hold it and has the same feel as an HTC One X which is a good thing. HTC makes really comfortable to hold devices and I like that about HTC. The phone fits really well in hand and my girlfriend loves it.+Camera:The rear camera on this phone is 5MP (2592x1944 pixels) and the front camera is 1.6MP. They both take great pictures and can even shoot 1080p videos at 30fps. I just think it would have been better if HTC put an 8MP camera instead because after all, this device is made for people who take a lot of pictures and share them with their friends/family on Facebook.+Battery:The battery on the HTC First is 2000mAh which is more than enough if all you're going to do is be on Facebook and check the web and whatnot. I tested the battery by being on Facebook and checking the web all day and so far it seems that the phone can last a full day with a single charge so that's great. Qualcomm has done an amazing job with the Snapdragon 400 because you can tell how efficient it is and how little power it consumes. The battery is non-removable if you guys are wondering.+Storage:The HTC First comes with 16GB of storage and can store a ton of pictures and HD videos. My girlfriend likes to take crapload of pictures and videos so the 16GB of storage is more than enough for her.+Processor:The Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (Dual-core 1.4 GHz) does an amazing job at keeping the phone running lag-free. So far I have not experienced a slow down with the HTC First. The Snapdragon 400 also has no problem handling 3D games. The phone comes with 1GB of ram which is plenty for most users.Cons:My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 so I don't want to nitpick on the HTC First because I could come up with a ton of bad things to say but I'm not going to. The only thing that I'm going to say is that the camera could have been an 8MP camera instead. It makes more sense to put an 8MP camera on a Facebook device because people will be taking pictures and uploading them on Facebook for everyone to see. The HTC First has last year's specs and it's a decent phone for people who are on Facebook.Overall, the HTC First is a mid-range device made for Facebook users in mind. It's the perfect phone if you are the type of person who has thousands of friends on Facebook and just love to share everything with your family/friends. The battery life in this phone is pretty decent and will last you a full day if you use it for Facebook and web browsing. The build quality is very well and has a nice soft touch when holding. HTC is known for making great devices, build quality-wise. If you are someone like me that checks Facebook once a week or so then I don't recommend this phone because there are better phones out there. But if you are someone who just loves being on Facebook and staying updated with your friends/family then this device is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382L66U1D53BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLI57J8#wasThisHelpful","R382L66U1D53BB","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm building a rig for my brother because his older card died (PNY GTX 460) and he would always complain about the card running hot and having a difficult time playing games. So I decided to go with the MSI HD7950 OC because it runs cool and overclocks like a champ. My brother is now happy because he can max any game he wants now. I was able to push the HD7950 to 1180mhz/1550mhz with 1.25 volts. The temps always stay below 75c with my overclocking and it idles at around 28c. Also, this card has 3GB VRAM which is more than enough for high resolution gaming at 1080p. I always control the fan of the card with MSI Afterburner because it gives you more control over the automatic fan settings.His previous card was the PNY GTX460 which was a great card when it was released but it couldn't handle all the modern games and started showing its age in newer games that my brother wants to play such as BF3, Crysis 3, Metro LL, Bioshock Infinite and Batman Arkham City. The new MSI HD7950 is not only faster but cooler and quieter than the GTX 460. I remember his GTX460 running so hot that it would shut down his computer in the middle of the game and I couldn't handle all the heat that it would put out so I made the right choice of upgrading his computer to the MSI HD7950. His other components would overheat because of the GTX 460.The MSI HD7950 runs super cool in his system even though I have not done any cable management whatsoever. I plan on getting another one to run in crossfire because I want to future-proof my brother's computer. At idle, the temperature hovers around 28c so that's pretty cool. While gaming, this card stays cool and quiet at 75C and I have it overclocked too. I have the fan set manually at 65% in CCC so it can keep the card cool while gaming. The fans get loud at about 70% so that's why I try to keep it at 65%. The HD7950 performs the same as the GTX 660ti/670 and AMD is getting better and better at quickly releasing beta drivers like Nvidia does. This thing can overclock like a beast which says a lot about the architecture of the HD7xxx series cards.Pros:+ Sexy design+ Whisper quiet fans+ Low temps both in idle and under load+ Overclocks like crazy+ 3 Year warranty+ 3GB of VramCons:- NoneOverall, I highly recommend the MSI HD7950 OC to anyone who wants a high end video card that plays all games on max settings. The MSI HD7950 OC is very well built, runs super cool and delivers a smooth gaming experience. It also comes pre-overclocked which is nice but I'm sure most people overclock it higher than that. I have always liked MSI because they make quality cards and have a great customer service which I prefer over some other brands. This thing can overclock like a beast which I really like. I have the card overclocked at 1180/1550 and it handles it fine.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ015OWARWF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRNRSLW#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ015OWARWF2","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a large SD Card that was fast and very reliable so after reading online for a bit, I finally decided to get the Samsung Electronics 64GB Pro Extreme and people were reporting fast speeds on USB 3.0 interface which is exactly what I wanted. I bought this memory card for my new Samsung Galaxy Camera and it is blazing fast and has super fast read and write. My Samsung Galaxy Camera comes with only 8GB of free space and it's barely enough for me to take HD videos or store my huge collection of music.I store a huge amount of HD videos, pictures and music to this memory card and I still have a ton of room left to store more stuff. I also put a lot of HD movies in my phone because I tend to watch movies when I travel around to other places. I have a USB 3.0 card reader that I use to transfer my stuff back to my computer from my phone and I was blown away after testing the speed of this card in a USB 3.0 interface.These are the speeds that I got using a USB 3.0 card reader testing it with CrystalDiskMark:Read --- WriteSequence: 77.56MB/sec --- 38.71MB/sec512K: 71.28MB/sec --- 3.822MB/sec4K: 6.119MB/sec --- 1.011MB/sec4K QD32: 6.211MB/sec --- 1.323MB/secSo as you can see from the results above, the speed of the Samsung Electronics 64GB Pro Extreme is pretty close to what Samsung advertises it. If you decide to buy this sd card which you should if you want the best of the best then I highly recommend getting a USB 3.0 card reader because it will make all the difference in the world. This was exactly what I wanted when I was shopping for an sd card for my Samsung Galaxy Camera. I am able to transfer large HD videos (over 6GB) in less than 2 minutes. I'm so happy with my purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K84QT7LHNCMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SK57IS#wasThisHelpful","R1K84QT7LHNCMC","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start my review of the 4670K, I just want to say that I already own the 4770K and I already know that it's more of a sidegrade over Ivy Bridge. I have written a review of the 4770K on Amazon and I will put a link in the bottom of this review so you guys can read it if you are interested. My main rig has a 4770K that I have overclocked to 4.6Ghz using 1.34 volts and I tried to get it to 4.8Ghz like I did with my 3770K (delidded) but the temps go through the roof (well over 90c) so that's why I keep it at 4.6Ghz.The 4670K that I got is for my second rig which has a 3570K also overclocked to 4.8Ghz (delidded) and temps stay below 80C using an H100i. The Corsair H100i is an excellent closed liquid cooler that I recommend to anyone who wants to achieve high overclocks with their CPUs. Before I ordered the 4670K, I already knew that the 4670K is barely faster than the 3570K and it's more of a sidegrade rather than an upgrade but I'm the type of person who likes to have the latest tech. Since the 4670K doesn't have HyperThreads, it runs a little bit cooler than my 4770K which is in my main rig. Just like when I upgraded to the 4770K, I have not been able to tell a difference with my new 4570K in all of my games such as BF3, FC3, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite and Metro LL etc. I wasn't expecting a big performance improvement because I already tested my 4770K vs 3770K and the difference was minimal and it's the same thing with the 4670K.Just like I said in my other review, if you are a gamer and you have a Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge CPU then upgrading to the 4670K won't bring you any improvements. If you got the cash then go right ahead but if you are on a budget then don't bother upgrading. Haswell does run hotter than Ivy Bridge and you will probably need to invest in a better cooler if you want to overclock it. Very few people have been able to achieve 24/7 stable overclocks (4.8Ghz and above) with Haswell and all of them have custom water cooling setups. You will also need to purchase a new motherboard which is disappointing considering the little difference that it brings to the table over Ivy Bridge. It would have been awesome if Haswell was made for LGA 1155 but it's not.The more I study Haswell, the more I think that it wasn't built for desktop users in mind but instead for laptops. I plan on getting a laptop that comes with Haswell just to see how good the battery life is because everyone keeps talking about it. Just like I said in my 4770K review, Intel has really improved the integrated graphics card in Haswell but it still doesn't deliver smooth fps in games. It still has a hard time playing old games such TF2, L4D2 and CSGO that use the Source Engine. The only reason I would upgrade to Haswell is if I was stuck on an old socket such as LGA 1156 and 1366 but otherwise, I wouldn't bother.In idle, the 4670K stays around 35c which is a bit hotter than my 3570K that idled at 31c. Under load using Prime95 (smallfft), my 4670K at 4.6Ghz (1.31 volts) stays below 80C while my 3570K hovered around 75C. There are some benchmarks that I have made so far.Cinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded)3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 7.524670K @ 4.6Ghz = 7.76SuperPI 1M3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 8.104s4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 8.015sI have a bunch of games installed in my computer so I decided to do a comparison against the 3570K both at 4.6Ghz. The first three games (TF2, L4D2, CSGO) are tested by using the iGPU @ 1080p since they are not very demanding, the rest of the games are tested by using a GTX 780(stock) @ 2560x1440.Team Fortress 2 - Max Settings3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 23FPS avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 37FPS avgCounter Strike GO - Max Settings3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 22FPS avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 34FPS avgLeft 4 Dead 2 - Max Settings3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 25FPS avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 32FPS avgFar Cry 33570K @ 4.6Ghz = 38fps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 42fps avgBattlefield 33570K @ 4.6Ghz = 58fps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 61fps avgCrysis 33570K @ 4.6Ghz = 29fps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 30fps avgBioshock Infinite3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 67ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 69fps avgHitman Absolution3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 63ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 66fps avgMetro 20333570K @ 4.6Ghz = 72ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 73fps avgTomb Raider3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 47ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 46fps avgBorderlands 23570K @ 4.6Ghz = 95ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 93fps avgBatman Arkham City3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 80ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 78fps avgAssassin's Creed 33570K @ 4.6Ghz = 53ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 55fps avgSleeping Dogs3570K @ 4.6Ghz = 58ps avg4670K @ 4.6Ghz = 60fps avgSo the difference with the first three games using the iGPU is massive in my opinion but it still isn't enough to provide a smooth enough gaming experience using the iGPU. If we move to the other games tested with a GTX 780 then the results become disappointing. The results speak for themselves but it should indicate if you are on an Ivy Bridge CPU then upgrading to Haswell will only give you around 3fps the most. You'd better off overclocking your 3570K and getting better results than a 4670K becuase it overclocks more and runs cooler.So in the end, I think Intel has focused too much on the iGPU and forgot about the CPU part. I have said it before and I will say it again, Haswell was designed for laptops in mind and also to compete with AMD's APUs. The iGPU in Haswell still falls short against AMD's 6800K but the CPU on Haswell destroys all AMD's CPUs and APUs. Intel has done a fantastic job at improving the iGPU in Haswell and lowering power consumption but it still isn't enough to play games like TF2, L4D2 and CS GO that aren't very demanding. If Haswell was made for LGA 1155 then it would have been awesome but since it requires a completely new motherboard, it will be difficult for me to recommend it to people. If you are coming from an AMD system and want to try out Haswell then it will be a huge upgrade regardless if you are on a FX-8350 or Phenom X6 1100T. I give the same rating that I gave to the 4770K and that is a 8/10 for the tiny improvements that it brings over Ivy Bridge and the new socket.If you guys want to read my review of the 4770K then just click on this link or you can search for 4770K on Amazon and it should be the first one listed there.http://www.amazon.com/review/R23I7H2WMMBO61/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO8TBQ0&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX 780 (Stock)CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K @ 4.6GhzPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPHV6FF1WI6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO8TBOW#wasThisHelpful","R3MPHV6FF1WI6O","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start my review I just want to say that I own the Galaxy S4, Note 2 and now the Galaxy Mega 6.3 and each one of them is unique in different ways. It's been a week since I got my Galaxy Mega 6.3 and this thing is super awesome. It has the same look as the Galaxy S4 but it's just larger. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 makes the Note 2 look tiny in comparison. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 feels like an experimental device from Samsung to see how big of a device people are willing to buy. Since we continue to buy their large phones, Samsung wants to know if we will continue to buy their phones regardless of the size. My main phone is the Galaxy S4 which I think is perfect and I won't get the Galaxy S5 if Samsung decides to make it larger than 5 inches. I think Samsung is getting a little carried away with their phones and trying to make their phones as big as possible. They just need to stop at 5 inches in my opinion.So far the Galaxy Mega 6.3 has been great and the battery life is outstanding, much better than my Note 2/S3/S4. Since the screen is 720p on this phone, it consumes less power than the S4 and it lasts much longer. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 comes with Snapdragon 400 which is a dual core CPU that has no problem handling everything you throw at it. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware as always and I always try to remove most of it because it can really slow down the phone and kill your battery.These are some of the things that I like about the Galaxy Mega 6.3:Pros:+Screen: I personally love big screens and the Galaxy Mega 6.3 has a nice 6.3 inches screen that makes everything stand out when viewing HD videos or playing games. The resolution on this phone is 720 x 1280 (233ppi pixel density) which is the same as the Note 2 but the Note 2 has 34 more pixel density than the Mega 6.3. It would have been great if Samsung put a 1080p screen on it like they did with the S4. 720p is still more than enough and you will hardly notice a big difference between 720p and 1080p on a phone.+Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great but I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz. I usually just disable all the things that I don't use to improve the performance of the phone and the battery life. I just wish all android phones would come with stock android instead of coming with pre-installed bloatware and whatnot that slows the phone down.+Design: The design is the same as the S4 which I have no problems with because I love my S4 to death. If you have a Galaxy S4 and love the design of it, then you will love the Mega 6.3's design as well. Since the phone is huge compared to the S4, it feels a lot heavier than my S4 because it's roughly 200g while the S4 is 130g. I don't have a problem with the weight of the phone but I'm so used to my S4 being light and thin.+Camera: The rear camera on this phone is 8MP (3264 x 2448 pixels) and the front camera is 1.9MP. They both take great pictures and you don't have to zoom in to look at the picture because of the screen being so big. My Galaxy S4 which has a 13MP camera takes better pictures but I rarely ever use the camera on any of my phones so this is not really a deal breaker for me.+Battery: The battery on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is 3200mAh which is more than any phone I know. It makes sense to put a large battery in a large phone because it has a huge screen that needs a lot of battery to stay on. So far it seems that the phone can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 20% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My Note 2 needs at least two charges to last through the day. The Snapdragon 400 is much more efficient than the Exynos 4412 that's on the Note 2. The Snapdragon 400 is also a dual core while the Exynos 4412 is a quad core which consumes more power.+Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (Dual-core 1.7 GHz) does an amazing job at keeping the phone running blazing fast but it would have been better if Samsung put the Snapdragon 600 that's on the S4 on this phone. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone but since the screen is bigger on the Mega 6.3, it makes more sense to have a powerful CPU to handle everything that you want to do. I'm not saying the Snapdragon 400 is slow or anything but it seems like Samsung wanted to experiment with the Mega 6.3. The Snapdragon 400 has no problems playing games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings.Cons:-Not 1080p screen-Less pixel density than Note 2-Last year's specsOverall, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is perfect smartphone for people who have large hands or large fingers but for regular users like me, it's not. My main phone will continue to be the S4 because it's perfect for me and has amazing specs. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 is a great phone and it doesn't disappoint if you are one of those people that don't care about how big your smartphone is. The battery life in this phone is almost always guaranteed to last you a full day with a single charge. I was disappointed that this phone came with a 720p screen and a dual core version but that's still more than enough for anyone. The specs of the Mega 6.3 feel like last year's specs and shows that Samsung is just experimenting with the Mega 6.3 to see how many people are willing to buy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNY0YMWI58WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1VVQ4O#wasThisHelpful","RWNY0YMWI58WN","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this PSU because I'm building a rig that needs a high quality PSU so I decided to get the Antec HCP 750W and I absolutely love it. I love all the products that Antec makes from PSUs to cases and have always bought their products in the past. I have never had a bad experience with their products and their customer service is top notch.Antec is known for making reliable and durable PSUs and the High Current Pro 750W is no exception. The installation process is pretty straight forward and you don't need me to explain how to install it because most of us who purchase these kind of things are geeks and we know how stuff works. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it runs cool and is very quiet. My old PSUs used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible.The Antec High Current Pro 750W is an extremely well built PSU and Antec has used high quality materials that really show when you hold it in hand. It has great sleeved cables that are nice and long and it's gold certified which is a big plus for me. The warranty is 5 years which is always nice because you never know what might happen in the future. I have had many products die on me a few days after the warranty expires and it's the worst thing that can happen. Antec's customer service is outstanding. They have always been very nice to me when I have had to return a few things in the past.The packaging is also great and Antec did a phenomenal job at making sure the PSU is well secured in the box. It runs super quiet and I can't hear a thing. I even tried running Prime95 for a few hours and I haven't heard a single noise coming from the PSU.Pros:+Quite+5 Year Warranty+Gold Certified+Great Packaging+Well sleeved cables+From AntecCons:-PriceyOverall, the Antec HPC 750W is a great power supply and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something reliable and durable. I have been building and fixing computers for as long as I can remember and I have had a lot of bad experiences with other PSUs but this one really got my attention. I give it a 10/10 for the build quality, sexiness, awesome sleeved cables, warranty and many other features that it has. Strongly recommended! I have always trusted Antec with their products and they are still working to this day.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R955JJKQJIUAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GH6UM0#wasThisHelpful","R955JJKQJIUAS","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just upgraded my laptop to the Lenovo T431s and I'm blown away by the built quality and the performance of this laptop. My old laptop was a Dell that had a Core 2 Duo which would overheat quiet badly but the T431s runs super cool and doesn't overheat at all. The Lenovo T431s has a 14-inch screen and weighs only 1.56 kg. This makes it great if you are the kind of person who travels a lot. I travel a lot so this is a big plus for me. The Lenovo T431s is the thinnest and lightest T Series model that Lenovo has released. This laptop doesn't just look great but it feels great when holding it in hand too. ThinkPad laptops are known for being very reliable and durable and the T431s is no exception.Lenovo has done a fantastic job at making it as thin and light as possible and it really shows when looking at it. My laptop came with an Intel Core i5, 4GB of DDR3 ram and 500GB HD which is super-fast for day to day tasks. It boots extremely fast and the screen resolution is pretty good. I just wish it came with a 1920 x 1080 resolution instead of 1600x900. Most laptops nowadays come with a 1080p screen and I don't know why Lenovo isn't making that the standard for their laptops.Since my laptop came with a HDD, I'm thinking of getting an SSD so I can see the true speed of this laptop. Putting an SSD will make the laptop even faster than what it already is. I feel like HDDs really bottleneck laptops and computers and upgrading to an SSD will make the bottleneck go away for good. I will update my review if I decide to put an SSD in the future. The screen is readable at any angle regardless of the light conditions. The laptop comes with 2 USB 3.0 ports which is super fast. I do a lot of backup and transfer large files so the USB 3.0 will be quiet fast for that. It also comes with a fingerprint scanner that's on the side of the arrow keys. It's a neat feature to have but I don't use it.The keyboard is the best thing about this laptop. It is a spill-proof keyboard which for me is great because I tend to spill sodas on my keyboard very often. The touchpad is also nice and smooth. I use my T431s for video rendering using the Adobe After Effects and it handles it like a champ. The battery life with the T431s is the best I have seen. It can easily last for more than 6 hours with the brightness turned down a little. This laptop doesn't come with an optical drive but I knew that before I got it so it's not really a big problem for me. I install most of my things from the USB port and I rarely ever use the optical drive. I have two 64GB USBs dedicated to installing programs and things like that.Pros:- Fantastic build quality- Phenomenal keyboard- Fingerprint scanner- Quiet- Runs cool- Spill-proof keyboard- Amazing touchpad surface- Light, thin and sleek- Good overall performanceCons:- 1600x900 is okay but it's not 1080pOverall, the Lenovo T431s is an outstanding laptop and is even better for someone who travels or just wants a very light and thin laptop. I have been using this laptop heavily for a week now and have not experienced any problems. I am very impressed with the phenomenal build quality of this laptop. Lenovo has another winner in their hands with this laptop. The spill-proof keyboard is the best feature this laptop has in my opinion. The only negative I can think of is the resolution which is 1600x900 but it's not a deal breaker for me.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4L231XW440L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7EN5U4#wasThisHelpful","R2H4L231XW440L","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just purchased a Corsair Neutron 256GB for one of my builds that I am doing and I'm blown away by the performance of this drive. My Windows 7 disk experience score went from 5.2 to 7.9 which is the highest it can go. Since I do a lot of backups and transfer large files, everything is so fast now compared to my old HDD that was starting to show its age. One thing to remember when installing an SSD is to make sure you connect it to a SATA3 6Gb/S port because you will not get the full speed of the SSD if you install it to a SATA2 port.The formatted size is 238GB and access and read speed are as advertised. I purchased the Corsair Neutron 256GB to replace my two years old Western Digital Blue 1TB because it was starting to show its age. Games would take forever to load and some of the programs that I use (CAD, Maya, Autodesk) would take forever to load on that HDD. I have four different SSDs at home from Intel 520, 840 Pro, Crucial M4 and now the Corsair Neutron and they are all blazing fast. I have sold the majority of my HDDs at home and only kept SSDs. I have three 2TB HDDs for HD movies and games and that's plenty for me.The installation process is very simple. You just have to make sure to enable AHCI in the BIOS (not IDE) so the SSD can work like it should. Also, make sure you flash the latest bios for your motherboard first before you install this drive. I was getting half the advertised read/write speeds but once I flashed the latest BIOS for my motherboard, it was all good. Another important thing to do after installation is to install the latest SATA drivers and chipset because it makes a huge difference. I got 100MB+ in read and write after installing the latest SATA drivers.I never get to see the entire Windows boot animation with this SSD which shows how fast this thing is. Windows 7 starts in ~8 seconds and shuts down in less than that. Everything opens immediately and games load fast and run great. I have disabled indexing, prefetch, defrag and hibernation because they are not needed when using an SSD. I have even gone ahead and completely disabled page file because most people recommend it to disable it since SSDs are already fast enough. I would recommend you keep page file if you are on a HDD but not on a SSD. You also save a ton of free space if you disable page file which is great.I have nothing but good things to say about the Corsair Neutron 256GB and since it's much cheaper than the competition, it's also a better buy than those other SSDs. Intel 520 and Samsung 840 256GB are both above $200+ but the Corsair Neutron 256GB is below $190. The Corsair Neutron 256GB is defiantly worth the price. I'm testing the Corsair Neutron 256GB with Crysis 3 and BF3 and maps load instantly. I had to wait over 30 seconds before to load the maps with my old Western Digital Blue HDD.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Great Packaging+ Blazing Fast+ Corsair Quality+ Cheaper than the competitionCons:- NoneOverall, I highly I highly recommend upgrading to a Corsair Neutron 256GB SSD if you are still on a HDD. The quick boot and super fast load of applications is amazing. The Corsair Neutron 256GB is also a lot cheaper than the competition and is as fast as Intel 520 and Samsung 840 Pro. Corsair's customer service is amazing and I have never had a problem with them.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BCP1BMV1KMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2X312S#wasThisHelpful","R25BCP1BMV1KMN","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received this case today and my first reaction was that it was too small but once I looked at it from different angles I realized that it was actually very well designed case and Corsair did a really nice job making the inside of the case with lots of openings for cable management and rubber grommets. I bought this case for a build that I am doing and I will be using it with my brand new EVGA GTX 770.The Corsair 350D comes with dual USB 3.0 headers which is great because I do a lot of transferring files back and forth from my external HDD. The materials used to make this case feel really high quality and Corsair is known for making great cases with high quality components. The case comes with a total of five fan mounts which is great because it keeps the case running cool.Another thing that I love about this case is the dust filter. My computer is always running 24/7 and is in the corner of my room under my desk which gathers a lot of dust. I have to always clean the inside because it gathers so much dust that the temps of my CPU go up by 5C if I don't clean it. Dust filers are a must when you purchase a case these days because who has time to clean their computers very often. Another great thing about this case is that you can mount an H100i on top which is what I'm planning to do. I already have an H100i in my other rig but now I will have to purchase another one for this case.Now let's talk a bit about what made me give this case a 4/5 and I was ready to give it a 5/5 easily. So when I got the case, everything looked nice and it looked like everything was perfect, design-wise, but I was wrong. Apparently, you cannot fit a full size DVD drive which is a huge let down for me. The DVD drive will fit but it will stick out and this makes the case look ugly. The motherboard that I am using is an Asus Maximus V Gene which is an average motherboard but the DVD-drive touches the side of the motherboard when it's inserted and it sticks out. After reading online on forums, there are some people who are having the same issue and they have suggested that I buy a smaller DVD-drive. Great, now I have to spend some more money on a DVD-drive.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Dual USB 3.0 Header+ Dust filters+ Great mid-size case+ Fits an H100i on top+ Corsair Quality+ SexyCons:- Full size DVD-drive won't fit (huge letdown)Overall, the Corsair 350D is a nicely designed case that comes with a lot of great features such as the dual USB 3.0 headers, dust filter and a ton of fan mounts to keep the system running cool. Having the option to mount an H100i is a bonus but the lack of fitting a full size DVD-drive ruined it for me. I was ready to give it a 5/5 but not being able to fit my DVD-drive is why I'm giving it a 4/5. Corsair should have thought about that because there are going to be a lot of people who aren't going to be happy about this.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GQLUXKU75UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWLL9MY#wasThisHelpful","R14GQLUXKU75UP","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corsair makes some of the highest quality products in this industry and their customer service is top notch. When I first got the 650D, the case fans stopped working out of the blue and Corsair replaced them for free. I didn't have to pay for anything. I have tried many fans before and most of them have stopped working and used to make a lot of weird noises. These fans have been working great for 6 months and they do an absolutely amazing job at pushing air into my case. These fans not only looking great but they dropped the case temps by 5C.Corsair Air Series AF120 is probably the highest quality fan I have ever tested and it makes my case look sexy. The materials used on this fan seem higher quality than the ones I have tested before. I have two of these fans running in my system and it moves a lot of air inside the case. I noticed the temperatures drop by 5C against the stock fans that come with the case. It also dropped the temp of my video card by 3C. This fan can also be used on a radiator and it will make a big difference over the stock fans that come with the radiator.They are also very quiet and even under full load you can't hear a thing. The packaging is great and comes with three colored rings and that's pretty cool. The price is fantastic for the quality of fans you are getting. The fans on full load are hardly audible.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Dropped my case temps by 5C.+ Great at moving air out of my case+ Super Quiet+ Corsair Quality+ SexyCons:- NoneOverall, these fans are highly recommended to anyone who wants to get the highest quality fans on the market. The fans are made by Corsair and that means high build quality which will last you a long time. If you want to drop your case fan temps by 5C and want to drop the temps of your GPU or CPU then this is the fan to get.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL50GQ1XVJBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RESGD0#wasThisHelpful","RL50GQ1XVJBO","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GTX 770 is basically a GTX680 which isn't necessarily a bad thing but a good thing since it's much cheaper than a GTX680 and a bit faster. I have five computers at home and I just upgraded one of them to the GTX 770 because the card that I had before (HD6850) just died on me. The GTX 770 is also better designed than a GTX680 and has a nice thick PCB. I love GPUs that have thick PCBs. :DThe EVGA GTX 770 comes with a base clock of 1046Mhz and a boost clock of 1085Mhz. It also comes with 2GB of Vram that is more than enough for gaming. It handles all of my games at 1080p without an issue. It also has no problems maxing games at 2560x1400 and the 2GB Vram is more than enough for that resolution. I'm seeing a lot of people that say 2GB isn't enough for anything above 1080p which isn't true.The GTX 770 has some nice 700-series features that the GTX680 didn't have such as GPU Boost 2.0 and OpenGL 4.3 support. GPU Boost 2.0 allows raising the frequencies of the GPU above their base clock as long as there is enough power headroom and it supplies the the voltage that it requires to accomplish this. This is a nice feature that Nvidia has implemented into their GPUs because it makes their cards much more efficient than the competition. There really isn't any reason to look at 6xx series cards at this point unless the GTX 680 comes down in price.The automatic fan speed is great but I usually use MSI Afterburner to control the fan speed of all of my cards because I have more control over the automatic fan speed. The card idles at around ~32c which is pretty cool and under load doesn't go above 70c. I love the smooth experience that this card delivers in games. This card comes at 10"" long which isn't the longest card out there but there are other cards that are shorter and fit into mid ATX cases. I recommend you measure your case before buying it before you run into any trouble.Pros:+ Robust design+ Whisper quiet fans+ GPU Boost 2.0+ Low temps both in idle and under load+ Overclocks like crazy+ EVGA Warranty+ SexyCons:- NoneOverall, I highly recommend the EVGA GTX 770 card to anyone who wants a GPU that can handle all the modern games without breaking a sweat. The EVGA GTX770 is very well designed and uses a quieter cooler than some other brands. The card runs super cool and overclocks like a monster. It delivers a smoother gaming experience than the competition and Nvidia makes awesome drivers. I also recommend going with EVGA when purchasing a GPU from Nvidia because they have one of the best customer service in this industry.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITFD15MZGR17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZIQZ40#wasThisHelpful","R2ITFD15MZGR17","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The N13 from Asus is a great little device that is capable of streaming Netflix on HD which is exactly why I got it. I have had it for about a year and it hasn't failed me. It's pretty easy to setup and has excellent signal strength. It has never dropped my connection so far and that's a huge plus. My previous adapters have always died after a few months of usage but this one has held up quite well so far. I have a lot of walls in my house and the range of the N13 is pretty solid.It connects fairly quick with my router (RT-N56U). I like the USB extender that comes with it.

The Asus N13 is by far the coolest wireless adapter that I have in my house. I get full signal strength with the N13 from the other end of the house.

"I've had this router for a about two years now and it is still performing great. It hasn't let me down yet which I am surprised because my previous routers have all died within 2 years. The RT-N56U has everything you want in a router. It's fast, has great range, and provides a very stable connection on both the 2.4 and 5ghz radios. The user interface is very user friendly and pretty straightforward. I have my Samsung Galaxy S4 hooked up to this router and I get crazy speeds on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands. I can get maximum Wi-Fi speeds in any room which is pretty nice and the Gigabyte network port is also useful.The Asus RT-N56U has two USB ports to connect external USB HDD and a printer. Asus has a very good hardware and strong networking team so this product is best for home use with gigabyte network port. Asus always makes outstanding products and they have a great customer service. I have never had an Asus product fail on me (knock on wood) and I will continue to purchase their products.The user interface in RT-N56U is very easy to get around and has every single feature someone could want in a router. I'm using this router as a standard wireless router and I have over 10 devices connected to it via wireless at any given time and it never slows down. I always do a lot of multiplayer gaming, download torrents, and stream HD media quite heavily and it handles everything without an issue. It overheats every now and then when a lot of things are going on but it's not a deal breaker.Pros:+ Blazing Fast+ Great Range+ Gigabyte network port+ Easy to set up+ Dual Band+ Constant Firmware updates+ USB Driver Support+ Slick DesignCons:- Overheats every now and thenOverall, the RT-N56U is a great router for anybody and comes loaded with a ton of features.

"Intel leads the world with microprocessor innovation and now they are leading the world with their SSDs. I have upgraded all of my computers at home with SSDs and most of them are running Intel's 520 SSD. The leap in technology that the latest SSDs provide is the most exciting upgrade for a PC in years. Rarely has an upgrade made such a dramatic change in performance. These new SSDs from Samsung, Intel, Crucial truly represent a quantum leap in computer technology. And now that the price is less than $1/GB, the upgrade is a no-brainer. I highly recommend upgrading to an Intel 520 SSD if you are still on a HDD. The quick boot and super fast load of applications is amazing.I sold my old Western Digital 500GB HDD since all of my computers in my house are using Intel 520 SSD. It was very simple to install and just make sure to have AHCI enabled in the BIOS so you can see the true speed of the SSD.

Games install and uninstall within a few minutes and programs less than a minute. I have disabled indexing, prefetch, defrag because they are not needed when using an SSD.When you buy an Intel SSD, make sure to download the SSD Toolbox from Intel's website which is super handy for updates and optimization. It has a nice friendly interface that's not overwhelming. It is a great tool to update the firmware of your SSD, optimize your OS and perform routine maintenance. I have nothing but good things to say about the Intel 520 SSD, and it is worth the price. I'm testing the Intel 520 with BF3 and maps load instantly. I had to wait over 30 secs before to load the maps with my old HDD. The warranty is 5 years which is more than enough. Intel has another winner in their hands!Pros:+ Fast Write and Read Speeds+ Fast boot times+ Programs/Games install blazing fast+ Constant firmware updates+ Great for MP games that have huge maps to loadCons:- NoneThe Intel 520 SSD is one of the best SSDs you can buy in the market and delivers crazy write and read results. It's also a bit more expensive than the competition but it's also worth the money. Everything from programs to applications are blazing fast and install/uninstall in just a few seconds. Also, if you are a gamer and play a lot of multiplayer games such as Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3 now you don't have to wait minutes for maps to load, it's almost instant. Overall, if you have the cash for a high end SSD, then the Intel 520 SSD won't disappoint you and it's very well worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L52T2Z95KFPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VCP9G6#wasThisHelpful","R2L52T2Z95KFPV","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a GTX Titan for my main rig and I'm blown away by its performance. I moved my GTX 780 into my second rig which had 2x HD7970s before. I couldn't handle all the terrible micro stuttering and crossfire drivers with AMD. The GTX Titan is designed to max games at crazy high resolutions but it will handle anything at 1080p without an issue. I play games at 2560x1600 and it does a phenomenal job at maintaining 60fps+ in all of my games. You'd need multi-GPUs to play games at that resolution but that's where the Titan separates itself from the rest.So far the card has been amazing. As you guys know, the card has an outstanding build quality. It is one of those things where you have to physically see and touch it to appreciate the quality. The clean look will make your build look amazing. Most of AMD's cards have plastic housing which makes the card look cheap and ugly. Big thumbs up to Nvidia for the cooler designs which make this card stand out from the crowd!I'm really surprised with the overclocking capability of the Titan because I have managed to overclock mine up to 1210mhz and it's been stable in all of my games and benchmarks. The temps stay below 73c while playing games. Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3 look stunning at 2560x1600 with my monitor and the 6GB VRAM helps a lot. Nvidia has another winner in their hands and now it's time for AMD to step up their game. If you are an enthusiast then the GTX Titan is worth every penny and you know you are getting a good deal when buying from EVGA because nobody can beat their customer service.The automatic fan speed is great but I usually use MSI Afterburner to control the fan speed of all of my cards because the automatic fan speed doesn't do a great job at keeping the card very cool when it's under load. The card idles at around ~28c which was roughly the same as my GTX780. Stress testing it with Furmark makes the temps go up to 79c. Furmark is an unrealistic benchmark and the card will never reach that temp while playing games. I love the smooth experience that this card delivers in games and now I don't have to deal with all the crossfire issues that I had with my previous cards.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Quiet fan+ Future-Proof with 6GB Vram+ GPU Boost 2.0+ Single GPU+ Low temps+ Overclocks like crazyCons:- PriceOverall, I highly recommend the card to anyone who wants to try out Nvidia's fastest single GPU. It's very well designed, uses probably the best cooler ever designed which makes the card run super cool. It delivers a smoother gaming experience than any other card I have tried. Also, you can't go wrong with EVGA because they have one of the best customer service in this industry.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1H2ETRX1C2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIUKH04#wasThisHelpful","R1O1H2ETRX1C2N","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Corsair 900D has finally arrived in my house and I'm blown away by this fantastic case. I can safely say it's the best full tower case in the market and there's no other case that looks this sexy. The 900D is enormous; you can fit a ton of radiators and still have room for more. The amount of options for cable management is mind blowing.This case has everything an enthusiast wants in a gaming case. You will find that a lot of thought was put into engineering the Corsair 900D and it really shows when looking at the case. Carrying this case when it's fully loaded is almost impossible because it gets so heavy with all the components inside. Cable management is very good with this case and Corsair has done a fantastic job at providing us with so many options for cable management.I'm upgrading from a Corsair 650D which was an amazing case but I moved it into my second rig. The fans that come with the case are sexy and quiet. You can hardly hear them when they are spinning under full load. With the Corsair 900D being so huge, it's easy to create a clean build with a lot of fans, custom cooling, etc because of the space and cable management options. The side window panel is great because you can view all of your components from outside.The tool-less design, cable management and the magnetic side panel dust filter make this the best case for enthusiasts. There's just so many features that this case has over other cases in the market. Airflow in the case seems to be pretty good and I know this case was mostly designed for water cooling but it does a great job at air cooling as well. I'm currently using a 4770K at 4.6Ghz which generates a lot of heat and this case seems to be doing a good job at moving the air out of the case. I'm using a Corsair H100i in push/pull configuration to cool the CPU and it fits perfectly in the 900D. The front three fans are intake and the back is the only exhaust. My temps with my 4770K at 4.6Ghz in idle hover around 32-35 and under load stay below 80c.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Quiet+ Big (could be a con for some but not for me)+ Widowed side panel+ Magnetic dust filters+ Amazing airflow+ Cable management+ Space for water-cooling+ Tool-less design+ SpaciousCons:- Doesn't cook me dinner.So the Corsair 900D is by far the sexiest case I have ever owned and I have owned a ton of cases before but none of them comes close to the 900D. I have never seen a case like the 900D that provides so many options for cable management, radiators and fan mounting options for enthusiast people like myself. The amount of radiators that you can put in the 900D is mind blowing. Dust filters play an important role in the 900D because they can keep your system running cool and prevent it from gathering dust. I wish my other cases had a dust filter because I'm so tired of opening them up and cleaning them. I highly recommend the Corsair 900D to anyone who wants the best enthusiast case on the market!My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KWSQH8CM2P6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1R8JT0#wasThisHelpful","R1KWSQH8CM2P6Y","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arctic Silver 5 is probably the best thermal compound that I have ever used, and I have used many. I have used it both in CPUs and GPUs and it does a phenomenal job at cooling my components. It keeps my 4770K very cool both in idle and under load. At idle the CPU stays around 33C and under load it hovers around 76C which is overclocked at 4.6Ghz. I'm using an H100i from Corsair to cool my CPU and it works very well with Artic Silver 5. The CPU stays below 65c while playing games such as Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3 on max settings.I know there are people out there who just go straight ahead and use the pre-applied thermal paste that comes with the CPU and get horrible temps. If you are going to spend a lot of money on a high end CPU then you might as well spend a few more bucks on a quality thermal compound. It doesn't add much to the cost of a build and it's worth it in the end because you will get much lower temps than with pre-applied thermal paste.Even when using Prime95, the CPU still stays very cool thanks to this awesome thermal paste. I use the pea method and have always gotten good results. I know some people use the single strip method right in the middle of the CPU and spread it out but I have found that the pea method works better.I did some comparisons against the pre-applied thermal paste that comes with most CPUs/GPUs and found out that Artic Silver 5 dropped my temps around 7-10c. Artic Silver 5 comes with plenty of paste that can last a long time. Make sure you do it right because some people have their own methods which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. If you don't apply it right, you may even get worse temps than before. Putting just the right amount of thermal paste between your CPU and your cooler makes all the difference, trust me.My main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BSTDBQAUZ3XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087X728K#wasThisHelpful","R2BSTDBQAUZ3XJ","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD5 is extremely well designed and it's absolutely awesome to look at. Everything is spread out that you have enough room to work with. It supports big air coolers like Noctua D14 and doesn't block the ram sticks. Updating the bios for this motherboard is a piece of cake. You download the bios, reboot into bios and it will automatically load the file from your hard-drive/USB and you are done. Gigabyte has done a fantastic job of creating an amazing motherboard and providing a ton of features for overclocking your CPU.I'm blown away by the quality of this motherboard and Gigabyte has always made high quality products from graphic cards to motherboards. This motherboard is so well designed and the bios is easy to work with thanks to the UEFI technology. Overclocking with this motherboard is super easy and I was able to get my old CPU (960T) to 4.2Ghz with no trouble at all. Just change the multiplier in the bios and you are all set. The heatsinks over the VRMs are big enough that keep it nice and cool.I have always liked AMD for keeping the same socket and having reasonable prices with their processors. AMD said that they will keep AM3+ socket even after Steamroller is released which is great because we don't have to spend money on buying a new motherboard. Steamroller will bring a ton of improvements both to IPC and will lower the power consumption quiet a lot.This motherboard supports the newest FX Processors and will support Steamroller when it gets released. Vishera CPUs work great in this motherboard and overclock great too. You just need to update the bios that Gigabyte will release in the future. Gigabyte is very good when it comes to releasing bios/drivers/firmware for their products. Overclocking in this motherboard is a piece of cake and the 8+2 phase VRM power design helps a lot in overclocking.The GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD5 also supports 3-way CrossFire or SLI which is great if you are a multi-graphics user. It also comes with 6 native SATA3 ports and has support for RAID 0, 1, 5, 10. I recommend this motherboard to anyone who is looking to get the best AMD motherboard on the market. The Asus Sabertooth 990FX is also a very good motherboard and they are equally good. I had my old Phenom X4 960T at 4.2Ghz (1.46 volts) using this motherboard and it had no problem handling it. If you plan on upgrading to Steamroller when it's released, then this is motherboard will support it.Pros:-PCIe 3.0x-USB 3.0-UEFI Bios-A ton of SATA ports-Easy to Overclock-3-Way SLI/Crossfire-8+2 Phase VRM-Sexy color schemeCons:-None, really.The Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD5 is one of the best motherboards for AMD that Gigabyte has made. It comes with a ton of SATA ports and comes with 8+2 Phase VRM that can handle a ton of volts like a champ. Overclocking with this motherboard is great and I have seen a lot of people push the Thuban CPUs up to 4.2Ghz using this motherboard. It has an amazing design and can support up to 3 way SLI/Crossfire. If you run multi-GPUs then this motherboard is great for that. The bios is also super easy to work on and update because of the UEFI technology. I highly recommend this motherboard to all AMD users who want a high end motherboard.My main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293RJ0AK6K0S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055QYKQE#wasThisHelpful","R293RJ0AK6K0S0","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this processor for 3D rendering and gaming and it does an outstanding job. I have it overclocked to 4.9Ghz using 1.48 volts and it is prime95 stable. Under load, temps never go above 55c and in idle it stays around 26c. I love overclocking this CPU and I will keep it until Steamroller is released. This CPU just plows through everything especially when playing games such as BF3, FC3 and Crysis 3. It runs around 50-60% usage when playing BF3 on max settings.I have always liked AMD for keeping the same socket and having reasonable prices with processors. Even though the processor does not have eight true cores, it's fast enough for gaming and applications. CPU-Z recognizes it as 4 cores/8 threads which is true. I'm using an H100i to get it overclocked to 4.9Ghz and it keeps the CPU very cool. The power consumption at 4.9Ghz is 302watts which is very high. The stock cooler is only good for stock settings but if you are going to overclock it then you need an aftermarket cooler.The FX-8320 also loves higher ram frequency and I have my ram overclocked to 2133Mhz and it's blazing fast. Vishera pulls less power than Zambezi and Steamroller will lower the power consumption even more. Vishera is up to 20% faster than Zambezi depending on the CPU load. It's not as fast as Sandy/Ivy Bridge or Haswell but it does its job very well. Intel has a huge power advantage over AMD because they are on 22nm with Ivy/Haswell and even on 32nm with Sandy Bridge they lowered the power consumption dramatically. Steamroller will be at 28nm while Broadwell will be on 14nm and it will be difficult for AMD to catch up to Intel.Overall, Vishera is a great CPU if you are on a AM3/AM3+ socket and does great in modern games and applications. It wins in some multi-threaded tests such as in the latest x264 and POV-Ray because they utilize all the cores available. Vishera loses in most single-threaded performance tests against Sandy/Ivy Bridge because it has weaker cores but makes up for it in multi-threaded tests. Power consumption is also a big negative for Vishera because it draws considerably more power under load compared when overclocked. It's a great CPU and I would recommend it to any AMD user.Pros:+Overclocks like crazy.+Strong in games+Supports 1866-2133Mhz Ram+Cheap+Works in older sockets+Excellent multi threaded performanceCos:-Power Consumption-Performs poorly in single thread applicationsThe FX-8320 is a powerful chip that can handle everything you throw at it, from games to heavy applications. If you are a 3D artist or an animator that uses applications that utilize all cores available such as 3Ds Max, Maya, CAD or Zbrush then the FX-8320 will go above and beyond to satisfy your needs. The FX-8320 also overclocks like beast and can handle overclocks of up to 5Ghz. I have seen people push this thing up to 5.3Ghz with water cooling and get crazy benchmark results. It does great in games that utilize all cores such as BF3, Crysis 3 or Metro LL. The only downside to Vishera is the power consumption and the performance in single thread applications. This chip works in older sockets but you first need to check with your motherboard manufacturer to see if there's a bios update.My main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25WKPPLK7O3ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O7YU56#wasThisHelpful","R25WKPPLK7O3ZJ","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had two of these cards in crossfire before I upgraded my main rig to the GTX780 and they were monsters. I had absolutely no problem maxing any game with 60fps+. These cards are now in my second rig which I use for gaming and they still run like beasts. I was able to push both of my HD7970s to 1200mhz/1600mhz with 1.25 volts. The temps always stayed below 70c with my overclocking and they would idle around 26c. Also, this card has 3GB Vram which is more than enough for high resolution gaming even though some people claim that it isn't. I used to play BF3 at max settings at 2560x1440 and the vram usage was around 2GB so it's more than enough.My 2x HD7970 used run pretty cool in idle around 26-28c and under load when playing games it would go up to 69-71c. My old HD6970s used to go up to 85c and they were quite loud. The automatic fan speed doesn't do a great job when the card is under load. I have to manually set the fan at 65% to keep the card cool. I usually use MSI Afterburner to control the fan speed of all of my cards because the automatic fan speed doesn't do a great job at keeping the card very cool.When playing modern games such as BF3, FC3 and Crysis 3, the temps stay in the low 60s which is relatively cool for this card. Stress testing it with Furmark makes the temps go up to 76c. This card has absolutely no problems at maxing BF3 or any other game for that matter. I tested it by playing BF3 at maximum settings at 2560x1440 and the fps stayed around 65fps.Pros:+ Sexy design+ Whisper quiet fans+ Low temps both in idle and under load+ Overclocks like crazy+ Made by Sapphire+ 3GB of VramCons:- NoneOverall, I highly recommend the HD7970 to anyone who wants a high end card that plays all games on max settings. The Sapphire HD7970 is very well built, runs super cool and delivers a smooth gaming experience. Sapphire also makes quality cards and has a great customer service which I prefer over some other brands. This thing can overclock like a beast which says a lot about the architecture of the card.

"I have had this motherboard in my HTPC for a few months now and I absolutely love it. It's been stable and hasn't given me any issues. I previously had the 5800K in this motherboard and I had it overclocked to 4.5Ghz with a few mouse clicks. I recently upgraded to the 6800K and this motherboard has let me overclock it to 4.8Ghz using around 1.48 volts. This board has 8 phase VRM which makes it awesome to overclock using this board. I have seen some people push this thing up to 5.3Ghz using this board with around 1.58volts which is incredible if you ask me.I use my HTPC to watch HD movies and do some light gaming and it absolutely handles everything I throw at it without a problem. I have also overclocked the ram to 2400Mhz because the 6800K benefits quiet a lot from higher memory speeds. I have also overclocked the NB frequency to 2000Mhz and have noticed a smoothness in both games and applications.The Asus F2A85-V Pro is a really high quality board at a decent price and I'm very impressed with Asus because they really know how to make amazing motherboards. The BIOS/UEFI is great and packed full of features and offers extreme features to overclock your CPU. This motherboard comes with 7 SATA 6 Gb/s ports which is one of the features that I love from this motherboard. The Asus F2A85-V Pro comes with two PCIe 2.0 x16 slots which is also very nice. It also has two PCI slots just in case for your older devices and three PCIe x16 slots.When I had my 5800K on this motherboard, I was able to get it to 4.5Ghz without a problem. The 6800K on this motherboard overclocks like crazy. I even pushed it to 5Ghz using only 1.51 volts with a CM212+ and this motherboard is able to handle it perfectly fine. The temps were too high so I went back to 4.8Ghz but if you have a good air cooler or water cooler then you can get it 24/7 stable at 5Ghz.Overall, this is a great motherboard to get and it will be even better when Kaveri (28nm) is released which will include massive IPC improvements and will work on this board with only a bios update. Kaveri will also lower the power consumption drastically and will overclock a lot higher than Richland. The Asus F2A85-V Pro is probably the best FM2 motherboard you can buy but it's also expensive but it's worth it in the end because you are getting a quality product that is durable and very reliable.If you want to build an HTPC for HD watching movies and doing some light gaming then this board will be more than enough for anything you throw at it. It has a ton of features for overclocking which is always nice to have. Another great thing about APUs is that it seems that more software developers are supporting OpenCL to take advantage of the GPU to accelerate performance so this will bring huge performance improvements to AMD's APUs in the future.Pros:-Will support Kaveri(28nm) when it's released-Runs cool-Three PCIe x16 slots-Slick design-A ton of SATAIII ports-Handles high overclocks-UEFI Bios-Sexy color scheme-From AsusCons:-NoneOverall, I highly recommend the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO motherboard to anyone who is looking to get the best AMD FM2 socket motherboard on the market. Not only handles high overclocks like a champ but it's also future proof because it will support Kaveri when it's released which will be on a 28nm die. Kaveri will bring huge improvements to the table and will feature a much faster GPU. It's a great motherboard to get if you want to build an HTCP for watching HD movies and doing some light gaming.If you guys are interested in reading my review of the 6800K then just search for 6800K on Amazon and it's the first review listed there.My main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7INIVAOX8ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F1DUAM#wasThisHelpful","R3U7INIVAOX8ZJ","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously had a 5800K in my HTCP and I was more than satisfied with its performance but now I have the 6800K in my HTPC that I use to watch movies and do some light gaming and it works like charm. It handles everything I throw at it without a hassle. Since the 6800K supports memory speeds of 2133Mhz, system memory speeds are important because both the CPU and GPU share the same memory interface and this is very improvement if you are a gamer because it can boost your FPS quiet a lot. I noticed a smoothness when playing games coming from the 5800K that ran at 1600Mhz.The stock frequency of the CPU is 4.1Ghz (1.4 volts) but it has a nice turbo of 4.4Ghz which is great. And the stock frequency of the GPU is 844Mhz (1.25 volts). The stock settings are more than enough to handle anything but I have mine overclocked to 4.8Ghz and it flies. It runs relatively cool with the stock cooler without needing to upgrade to an aftermarket cooler. I even tried overclocking it to 5Ghz using my CM212+ using 1.51volts but it generated a lot of heat so I went down to 4.8Ghz. I also overclocked the GPU to 1020Mhz from stock 844Mhz using around 1.34 volts and games are much more smoother now.The motherboard that I am using to overclock my 6800K to 4.8Ghz is the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO which is the best motherboard you can get for FM2 socket. The Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO has 8 phase VRMs which makes it awesome to overclock and it can handle a ton of volts without a problem. I have seen some people push the 6800K up to 5.3Ghz using this board with around 1.58 volts which is incredible if you ask me. I highly recommend getting the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO if you want the best FM2 socket motherboard. The motherboard will also support Kaveri (28nm) when it's released which will bring a ton of improvements and lower power consumption.Let's talk a bit about the power consumption at 4.8Ghz because it really is amazing how little power this thing consumes. In idle, it consumes roughly 8-9 watts and under full load it consumes around 108-110watts. Even though Core i3 Ivy Bridge is at 22nm and has better power consumption than Richland which is at 32nm, I still think the power consumption is more than acceptable.I am able to play games like Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2 and Counter Strike GO without a problem at 1920x1080. It can even handle some modern games at medium settings which I think is amazing. I'm really impressed with the APUs that AMD has been making.Here are some benchmarks that I did against the 5800K both overclocked to 4.5Ghz. I wanted to test both of them at 4.8Ghz but I couldn't get the 5800K anywhere near 4.6Ghz without crashing and the temps going through the roof so instead I dialed it back at 4.5Ghz.SuperPi5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 1394.66 Seconds6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 1244.22 SecondsCinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded-GPU)5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 37.54 FPS6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 45.38 FPSCinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded-CPU)5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 3.266800K @ 4.5Ghz = 3.87All the games that I have tested so far have been at max settings except for Metro LL and BF3 which were unplayable.

As you can see from the results above, the improvements in games and applications is less than impressive. What I like about AMD and their APUs is the fact they still use the same socket (FM2) which means you will be able to upgrade your APU in the future to the one that will use the steamroller cores which will be bring a ton of improvements and lower the power consumption drastically. The iGPU in the 6800K is also much faster than Haswell's iGPU and will play games a lot smoother. The driver support will also be better than Intel because it will be directly from AMD. I give this APU a 4/5 just because of the tiny improvements over Trinity. I don't have a lot of time now but I will update my review once I do more tests.If you guys want to read my review of the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO then go to this link and it should be the first one listed there.http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-240-Pin-Motherboards-F2A85-V-PRO/dp/B009F1DUAM/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleMy main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3647M0X5NMHEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPLGGXM#wasThisHelpful","R3647M0X5NMHEY","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into Best Buy today because I need a DVI to VGA adapter but the cheapest one I could find there was $12.99 so I walked out of there. I went on Newegg and immediately found this and purchased it. It was half the price of what Best Buy was trying to sell which really isn't a surprise because Best Buy is known for having ridiculous prices. I don't understand how they are still alive in this industry with those ridiculous prices.The reason why I needed a DVI to VGA adapter is because I'm using three monitors off a Sapphire HD5850 and I used two of these adapters to connect my side monitors and they work flawlessly. My middle monitor is connected with a displayport to VGA adapter and so far I have had no problems with these adapters. They work perfectly and do what they are supposed to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW4BX3C0FFPR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002N3KJUI#wasThisHelpful","RW4BX3C0FFPR9","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noctua makes possibly the best fans on the market. I have never had a bad experience with their products and they offer a 6 year warranty on their products. Their customer service is also amazing. Most fans will not last you that long; most fans stop working after 3-4 years if you are lucky. This is the reason you buy these fans because you know they will last you a long time and you always have the warranty as a backup option in case it dies out.This is probably the highest quality fan I have ever tested and I'm more than happy with my purchase. While they do cost more than the competition, they are also made with better materials that last much longer than other fans. I have used two of these fans as a case fan to cool my system and it moves a lot of air inside the components. I noticed the temperatures drop by 2-3c against the stock fans that come with the case. The best of all is that this fan can be used on a radiator and it will make a big difference over the stock fans that come with the radiator.They are also very quiet and even under full load you can't hear a thing. The packaging is great and comes with a lot of useful accessories. Includes all the low noise adapters you need to silence the fan without a fan controller. The build quality is top notch. It moves a good amount of air while being very quiet.The only negative about it is the cost and the color scheme. I personally don't care about the colors because they are inside my case and I rarely see them so it doesn't bother me that much. If you have the cash for it then I recommend you get a few of these fans because it will make a big difference in terms of temperatures.Pros:+ Sturdy+ Dropped my case temps by 3C.+ Great at moving air out of my case+ Super Quiet+ Can be mounted on a radiatorCons:- Color scheme- CostThe Noctua 140mm fan does an amazing job at moving the air out of the case quickly without getting your components to overheat. It will also drop the temp of your components which says a lot about the quality of the fan. It's also whisper quiet ever under full load. Since the fan is so efficient and quiet, it make sense to mount in your radiator if you are running a water cooling setup. I highly recommend the Noctua 140mm to anyone who wants the best fan on the market. I know the color scheme isn't the best thing about this fan but don't let that fool you.My full rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKLYF7IIHVR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEGRGNO#wasThisHelpful","R2DKLYF7IIHVR8","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pasting this review from my website but you will have to go to my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures in Amazon reviews. The link to my website is posted on the comments.The other product that we will be taking a look at is the NH-U9B SE2 and this is basically a scaled down version of the NH-U12P SE2. The NH-U9B SE2 uses the same exact heatsink as the original NH-U9B but the only difference is that the original heatsink used only one NF-B9 PWM (92mm) fan while the newer model uses two NF-B9 PWM fans. Another difference is that the original heatsink did not support the new Intel CPU sockets while the NH-U9B SE2 adds support for LGA1156/1155/1150 as well as LGA1366 via the latest SecuFirm2 mounting system.The Noctua NH-U9B SE2 is a compact CPU cooler aimed at the mATX and HTPC users who want the performance of a tower heatsink in a compact form. It has four dual heatpipes and comes with dual fans that will help keep the CPU temperatures in check inside mATX chassis and HTPCs.

"I have had the Sabertooth Z87 for a few weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. It is very well built, sleek, stays cool while gaming and has an enormous amount of neat features. The BIOS/UEFI is great and packed full of features and offers extreme features to overclock your CPU. There are two modes in the bios, easy and advanced. The easy mode is great if you need to constantly change boot devices and do basic things. The advanced mode has a ton of options that it can be overwhelming at first, but give it time and you'll see how nice it is. This board looks awesome in my lovely Corsair 650D! I can safely say that this is another outstanding motherboard from Asus and it will blow you away with the amount of features that it provides.This motherboard comes with 8 SATA ports which is amazing and they are all SATA 6 Gb/s ports. The motherboard is SLI and Crossfire ready so you can stick two of your favorite cards in there and get awesome performance. This motherboard comes with the TUF third generation thermal armor which makes use of air cooling through a single fan that pushed cool air to the internal electrical components. It's a nice way to cool the components in the computer. With three mouse clicks you can get your CPU running in 4.6Ghz in no time. I recommend this motherboard to all the enthusiasts who want the best of the best.Also, a great feature that this motherboard has that I like very much is the process of updating the bios. There's no need to have a CPU, memory, or GPU in the motherboard to update your bios. All you have to do is simply plug in a compatible bios and press the tiny little button that's near the USB 3.0 ports on the back of the motherboard and it will automatically update it. This motherboard comes with caps that go over the ports to prevent dust getting in them which I think is pretty neat. I usually get a lot of dust in unused ports in my motherboards so this is great for me.I'm currently running my 4770K at 4.6Ghz using 1.34 volts and the temps stay below 85c. I tried running it at 4.8Ghz like I did with my 3770K (delidded) but the temps go well over 90c so it's not 24/7 stable. I'm using an H100i from Corsair to overclock my CPU and it keeps it relatively cool at this frequency. It's a great motherboard if you want to achieve crazy high overclocks. This motherboard has everything that you want to achieve high overclocks and it's without a doubt one of the best looking motherboard on the market. This motherboard has a back-plate shield which makes this a very sturdy motherboard and quite sexy.Haswell runs hotter when overclocked compared to Sandy Bridge and a tiny bit worse than Ivy Bridge. Reaching 4.6-4.8Ghz might be easy to accomplish with this motherboard but you'll need volts in the range of 1.35~1.45 so be prepared for a lot of heat and proper liquid cooling because you will need it. The only negative I can think of is the AI Suite 3 which is nice but very buggy at the moment, crashes a lot if you try to change some settings. I'm sure Asus will update it. If you have any questions about the motherboard then just leave a comment here and I'll be more than happy to reply.Pros:-Sturdy-High quality components-A ton of SATA3 ports-Easy to Overclock-Good VRM cooling-Sexy color schemeCons:-NoneOverall, I highly recommend the Asus Sabertooth Z87 motherboard to anyone who is looking to get the best Asus motherboard that is socket LGA 1150 and wants to achieve high overclocks with their Haswell CPU. I'm currently running my brand new 4770K at 4.6Ghz without a hassle thanks to this motherboard. If you plan on upgrading to a Haswell CPU then this is the motherboard to get!If you guys are interested in reading my review of the 4770K then just search for 4770K on Amazon and it's the first review listed there.My full rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTCZEH1XXM5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRJVZOM#wasThisHelpful","R1QTCZEH1XXM5G","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update#3: I spent the last few months testing and analyzing the 4770K and now it's time to share those results with you guys. I have come to the conclusion that the VRM (voltage regulator) that Intel has integrated into the die does more harm than good. Every since I bought this chip and overclocked it, I have noticed that it's been degrading faster than my 2600K and 3770K which both were overclocked to the same frequency (4.6Ghz) as my 4770K. I have noticed that I need to add at least a minimum of 0.007 volts every few months because my CPU starts to crash out of the blue even though it used to be 100% stable when I have tested it. I bought the 4770K the first day it came out and I immediately overclocked it to 4.6Ghz using around 1.34 volts which used to be 100% stable and then it slowly started to degrade. I have kept my 2600K and 3770K overclocked to 4.6Ghz for years and they haven't degraded one bit. I'm still using the same amount of voltage on my 2600K and 3770K that I did when I first got them and they are still going strong. Haswell on the other hand wants more and more voltage to be stable at the same settings that it used to be.Here are the results that I have recorded these past few months using the 4770K:Month------Frequency/VoltageJune:------4.6Ghz 1.3400 volts | I got the chip the first day it was released and oc'd it to 4.6Ghz using 1.3400 volts and it was 100% stable. I was a happy camper :)July:------4.6Ghz 1.3400 volts | so far so good but there were some moments when my system would hang but I just ignored it.August:----4.6Ghz 1.3470 volts | I started getting random crashes even though I had made no changes to my computer or upgraded anything since I bought the chip. The only way to stop those crashes was to add a bit of voltage to the CPU so I added 0.007 volts and my problems went away. That might not seem like a lot of voltage but overtime it accumulates and the temps slowly starts to increase.Sept:------4.6Ghz 1.3470 volts | so far so good. I didn't experience any hangs or freezes in Sept but then again I didn't use my computer all that much because I was studying for exams.Oct:-------4.6Ghz 1.3540 volts | My computer started crashing again on October even though nothing was changed from last time. I formatted my computer because I thought maybe I had installed something but it still was crashing. As soon as I added another 0.007 volts, my system stopped crashing.Nov:-------4.6Ghz 1.3540 volts | My computer seems stable now but there are some random moments where it freezes for no reason or it just hangs during games(BF4, Crysis 3, Batman AO, Metro LL, etc). I feel like I may need to add a bit more voltage to get it again fully stable. I have made no changes/upgrades to my computer since I bought the chip but yet, it still wants more voltage to be stable at the same settings that it used to be.My 2600K and 3770K haven't degraded since I bought them but my 4770K is degrading faster than any chip I have ever owned. If you Google ""haswell degradation"", you will see a lot of people that are having the same issue as me. You have to keep in mind that whenever I'm adding ~0.007 volts every few months, the temperatures are also getting harder and harder to control. My advice to anyone who is looking to buy this chip or has already bought it is to not overclock it past 4.2-4.3Ghz or your chip will degrade very quickly. I think I'm going to drop my frequency to 4.2Ghz because the temperatures are getting out of control even though my chip used to be 100% stable at 4.6Ghz when I first got it and my H100i was able to keep the temps low. But now, the temperatures are quickly reaching 90c. And for that specific reason, I'm going to take off another star from my review because Intel has really cut corners on the design of Haswell.Update#2: I finally overclocked my 4770K to 4.6Ghz using 1.34 volts and the temps stay below 85c. I tried running it at 4.8Ghz like I did with my 3770K (delidded) but the temps go well over 90c so it's not 24/7 stable. I'm using an H100i from Corsair to overclock my 4770K and it keeps it relatively cool at this frequency. The motherboard that I'm using to overclock my 4770K is the Asus Sabertooth Z87. It's an amazing motherboard and I highly recommend it to everyone if you want the best motherboard for LGA 1150 socket. You can get some crazy high overclocks with that motherboard and it has not problems handling volts well over 1.4+. I have posted the link to my review of the Asus Sabertooth Z87 at the bottom of this review in case you guys want to read it.Update#1: I finally had some time this weekend to do more benchmarks in more games that I play and I was rather disappointed from the results that I got. I have updated my review with more benchmarks from popular games so make sure to look at the results below.It's been two days since I got my 4770K and I have been testing the hell out of it, from stock speeds to overclocking it to extreme settings. I can safely say that it's not worth upgrading if you have an Ivy Bridge CPU (3570K, 3770K). My previous CPU was the 3770K and I had it overclocked to 4.8Ghz using only 1.38 volts with an H100i from Corsair. I delidded my 3770K and now my temps never go above 80c. Now that I have the 4770K, overclocked to the same frequency, the difference is ~2-3% faster in pretty much everything that I have tested, from games to applications. So far I have not been able to tell a difference in games (BF3, FC3, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Metro LL etc) except for 3fps extra. Don't expect huge fps improvements in games that's what I'm saying.If you are a gamer and you have a Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge CPU then I don't recommend upgrading because you'd need a new motherboard which isn't worth it in my opinion. Haswell wasn't built for desktop users in mind but instead for laptops/ultrabooks and that's where it shines. The integrated graphics card is much more efficient and faster than what it was in Ivy Bridge but it still doesn't deliver smooth fps in games. I tried playing Team Fortress 2 in 1080P and it started lagging so bad that it wasn't playable. If you are stuck on an old socket such as LGA 1156, 1366 then this CPU is for you. You will notice huge improvements coming from one of those sockets.Now let's talk about benchmarks and power consumption.In idle, the CPU consumes roughly 39-41 watts and that's a bit better than my old 3770K which consumed ~70 watts. Under load using Prime95 (smallfft), my 3770K at 4.8Ghz pulled ~260 watts and now the 4770K pulls ~274 watts. 4770K's TDP is 84 watts which is 7 watts higher than the 3770K. I'm not really concerned about power consumption because it's not that big of a difference coming from an Ivy Bridge CPU. With my 3770K @ 4.8Ghz (delidded), the temps never go above 80c but with the 4770K @ 4.8Ghz, the temps are going well above 90c and that's not 24/7 stable for me. I will look more into this later(maybe delid it like I did with the 3770K?)Cinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded)3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 9.724770K @ 4.8Ghz = 9.87All the games that I have tested so far have been at max Settings @ 2560x1440/GTX780 (Stock).Far Cry 33770K @ 4.8Ghz = 41fps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 46fps avgBattlefield 33770K @ 4.8Ghz = 63fps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 68fps avgCrysis 33770K @ 4.8Ghz = 31fps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 33fps avgBioshock Infinite3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 72ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 75fps avgHitman Absolution3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 69ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 73fps avgMetro 20333770K @ 4.8Ghz = 78ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 77fps avgTomb Raider3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 52ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 55fps avgBorderlands 23770K @ 4.8Ghz = 98ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 103fps avgBatman Arkham City3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 84ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 88fps avgAssassin's Creed 33770K @ 4.8Ghz = 58ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 56fps avgSleeping Dogs3770K @ 4.8Ghz = 64ps avg4770K @ 4.8Ghz = 66fps avgAs you can see from my results above, the difference is minimal in games which makes upgrading to Haswell worthless if you are coming from an Ivy Bridge CPU. I noticed an increase in fps by 3 to 5 frames in most games and I even lost a few fps in some games.Overall, Intel has a done a nice job at improving the integrated GPU and lowering power consumption but it feels like Intel focused too much on laptops/ultrabooks and forgot about the desktop users this time. I'm still testing the CPU and I will update my review once I'm able to do more tests. If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will be more than happy to reply. I would recommend Haswell for desktop users that are stuck on an old sockets(1366, 1156)but not being backwards compatible is what kills this chip. For those who are on an AMD system and are thinking about upgrading then it will be totally worth it and the difference will be huge both in games and applications. Since Intel has no competition in the desktop realm then focusing on raw performance is not what they are after anymore. I give this CPU a solid 8/10 because of the tiny improvements over Ivy Bridge and the new socket.If you guys want to read my review of the Asus Sabertooth Z87 then it should be the first one listed there.http://www.amazon.com/Asus-Sabertooth-Z87-1150-Motherboard/dp/B00CRJVZOM/ref=cm_rdp_productMy full rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23I7H2WMMBO61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO8TBQ0#wasThisHelpful","R23I7H2WMMBO61","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Screen protectors are very important to consider when having an expensive device such as the Galaxy S4 and you want to make sure that the screen protector will do its job or otherwise you will get a crack on the screen and nobody wants that. This is my first time buying a Skinomi screen protector and I was a little skeptical at first but I think I made the right decision in the end.I had a little problem installing the screen protector at first but the box includes everything you need to install it. I didn't bother reading the directions when I got it but make sure you clean the screen then wet the screen protector and apply it to the screen of the phone. Skinomi recommends leaving the phone to rest without the battery for a solid 24 hours and this process leaves no bubbles at all. My other screen protectors have always left bubbles on my phone. It's a great screen protector and does a great job at protecting the screen and who doesn't like lifetime warranty?Pros:+ Protects that beautiful screen of yours from cracks+ Lifetime Warranty+ Fits perfectly+ InexpensiveCons:-NoneOverall, I can say I am happy with the purchase I made. My phone feels secure now having installed this screen protector. Most of the other screen protectors are expensive and a rip off in my opinion but this one is perfect.

"I have had the Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and I have decided to buy a cheap case to protect it from scratching and cracking the screen.  I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this case because I wasn't sure it would satisfy me. Before purchasing this case, I looked on Amazon to see what other cases there were and all of them were sort of expensive and I just wanted something that would get the job done while not being too expensive and this was the best case I could find.After getting the case, I can safely say that there's no other case out there that can beat this case in price. If anybody out there is not sure what case to get that will keep their Galaxy S4 protected then you have found the one. This case makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand and doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It fits perfectly with the phone. One little thing that bothers me is that the buttons (power and volume) are a little hard to press but other than that, it's hard to beat the price of this case.Pros:+ Makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone+ Fits the phone perfectly+ CheapCons:- The power and volume buttons are a little hard to pressOverall I am happy with the purchase I made and I'm enjoying this case.

"I have had the H100i since it came out and it's been great so far. I have managed to overclock my 3770K to 4.8Ghz using only 1.38 volts and temps never exceed 80c thanks to this awesome cooler from Corsair. The Corsair H100i is very well built and Corsair has fixed all the problems that people had with the original H100. After using the h100i for a few months, the fans stopped working out of the blue and I contacted Corsair and they sent me new ones for free. My case looks awesome because of the sexiness of this cooler. The CPU cooling block looks very good. Radiator and fans are the standard for corsair. The original H100 had very thin tubes but the h100i has nice shiny black thick tubes that not only look great but perform a lot better.If you are having trouble overclocking your CPU due to high temps then the H100i will fix that for you. You will get awesome idle temps with this CPU and even better temps under load. My 3770K idles at ~22c and under load doesn't go above 80c which to me is amazing because I was getting much higher temps with the Noctua D14. I have tried many good air coolers but none of them have given me better temps than the h100i, especially under load. I have the fans set up as push/pull in my case and this results in much lower temps both in idle and under load. The fans are very quiet in idle and the noise is very acceptable at full load.The software is pretty straight forward and easy to use. It reports the core temperatures, not the socket temperatures like most of the other programs out there which is not accurate. A nice thing about the software is the fact that you can set custom fan speeds/temps which comes in handy for people that want to control the temps in their system. The software will even detect your graphics card temperatures and fans if compatible. You can monitor and adjust everything such as the Corsair logo light on the block to change colors with different temps.Pros:+ Dropped the temp of my CPU by 25C+ Quiet Fans+ Corsair Quality+ Sexy+ Thick tubes+ Handles high CPU overclocks like a beastCons:- NoneOverall, if you are looking for the best closed liquid cooler and don't have the time or money to build your own custom water cooler then the H100i will go above and beyond to satisfy your needs. Just make sure this unit will fit in your case because I have seen many people on forums who have purchased one of these and then realize it won't fit. I highly recommend this closed liquid cooler to anybody who's looking to overclock their CPU and there's no other company that can come close to Corsair's customer service.My full rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 3770K @ 4.8 GHzPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z77OS: Windows 7 64bit","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FBFS5SQXTP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZN2NH6#wasThisHelpful","R21FBFS5SQXTP7","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are sick and tired of the same WWII first person shooter games then I highly recommend giving this game a try. I decided to give Call of Juarez Gunslinger a go because it's so different from any other game out there and I am glad that I did. This game will definitely get your attention.It has a decent story line that will keep you hooked right away but the ending is predictable. I will talk more about that later. The voices used in this game feel very realistic and definitely add to the Western flavor of this FPS. The weapons have a satisfying heft and sound to them which add to the realism of the game. The sound that the weapons make is one of the best I have heard from all the games I have played. You can always experiment with various weapons that you can find along the way. The graphics are not the best out there but they are above average and you don't need a strong computer to run the game. I'm playing the game on maximum settings and it runs very smoothly.I haven't encountered any major bugs so far in the game but the occasional glitches that you see in most games like getting stuck into objects or the AI not attacking you is present in this game. The levels in this game feel well designed with a lot of details but they are too linear. It feels like you are going from point A to B and there's nothing else to explore along the way. The game is not very long, around 5 hours but most of the games nowadays are like that. When you complete the game, you unlock a harder mode called True West.A few negative things about the game are the boss battles. The boss battles feel very shallow and frustrating. They are not very well made in my opinion and really hurt the overall game. The only way to win against boss battles is to spam dynamites at them from behind cover. Any other move will result in instant death. This gets very frustrating as you progress throughout the game and I wish the developers would have thought of some other clever way to win against the boss battles.Another thing that I mentioned above that I think is negative about this game is that the ending is predictable. I won't spoil the ending but as soon as you start the game, you know how it will end. This is isn't necessarily a bad thing but it would have been cool if the ending was completely different than what you'd expect. And as I said earlier, the levels are very well made with a lot of details but they are too linear. If you try to leave the boundaries of the map, you'll get a reminder that you are leaving the main game and if you keep going, you will teleport back to your old destination.Overall, the game feels solid most of the time but a few things such as the boss battles, predictable ending and linear level design hurt the overall game. It's not a very long game, around 5 hours but when you finish the game, you unlock a harder mode called True West that you can play through. If you want to play a game that's different from all the other WWII based FPS then this game will grab your attention. I give this game an 8/10.My full rig:Sapphire 2xHD7970 @ 1.2 GHz16GB of RAMWindows 7 64bitIntel Core i7 3770K @ 4.8 GHzSamsung 840 Pro 256GB","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RDWC4PSPXCLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMSCWEU#wasThisHelpful","R1RDWC4PSPXCLN","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you guys are looking for the very best PSU on the market then look no further because you have found the one. The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WG2 is one of the best PSUs I have ever bought, it is extremely well built, super quiet, has great sleeved cables that are nice and long and can even power the most power hungry GPUs that's out there. The warranty is another great thing about this PSU because it's 10 years which is always nice because you never know what might happen in the future. I have had many products die on me a few days after the warranty expires and it's the worst thing that can happen if you invest on an expensive product such as this.The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WG2 really feels like a premium PSU when holding it and the materials used to make it really make the PSU stand out from the rest of the PSUs that are out there. It feels very well polished and it has a nice clean design that's not cluttered like the rest of the PSUs I have bought. There are plenty of cables in the box that are packaged quite well. I can't hear the fan spinning at all when gaming and even under full load using Prime95 which says a lot about the quality of the PSU. It has high quality Japanese capacitors unlike some PSUs out there that use cheap capacitors. There are so many cables and slots that you can use and I doubt I will ever need more than just a few.Obviously you are paying a premium for this power supply and you are definitely getting something that's worth every penny you spend. I am more than satisfied with it and it has no problem handling my setup. Some people compare this to the Corsair HX1050 or the OCZ Z1000W but the EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WG2 feels like a much better quality PSU than both of them. I'm planning on buying another one for my second rig because I'm planning on doing a 3-way SLI GTX780s and I need the best PSU that's out there. I always trust EVGA when buying one of their products and I always recommend it all of my geeky friends that build computers almost on a weekly basis. I have always had a good experience with their GPUS and now I have fallen in love with their PSUs. I can't recommend this product enough times.The installation process is pretty straight forward and you don't need me to explain how to install it because most of us who purchase these kinds of things are geeks and we know how this stuff works. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it runs super cool and is whisper quiet. My old PSUs used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible. I have had many PSUs shut down on me while playing games because they would overheat but this one handles everything like a champ.The packaging is also great and it really feels like EVGA really made sure everything was in the right place. This PSU has a nice steel handle which is cool because you can carry your PSU around if you want to try it in other computers. My previous PSUs have been noisy but this one is whisper quite. You really can't go wrong with EVGA because they are hands down the best with their products and customer support. And how can you beat a 10 year warranty?Pros:+10 Year Warranty+Gold Certified+Super Quiet+Great Sleeved Cables+Steel Handle Make It Look Sexy and Easy To Carry+High amperage for even the most power hungry GPUs+Amazing build quality+Clean design+Fully modular+Great Packaging+From EVGACons:-NoneOverall, if you have the cash to spend on a truly high quality PSU then the EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WG2 is the one to get. I have been building and fixing computers for as long as I can remember and I have had a lot of experiences with other PSUs but this one really got my attention. If you are looking for something that's reliable, durable and future-proof then the SuperNOVA 1000WG2 is the PSU you should purchase. The packaging is absolutely insane and comes with a ton of cables. When holding the PSU, you can really feel the high quality materials that EVGA used to make this amazing PSU. I give it a 10/10 for the build quality, sexiness, awesome sleeved cables, warranty and many other features that it has.

"UPDATE: There's a new patch that was released which fixes FOV and performance improvement on AMD hardware. It seems that the game is much more smoother now and I get 10+ extra fps now. So I guess it wasn't an issue with the AMD's GPUs but it was the game itself causing the low fps. I just finished beating the game and it took around 8hrs or so on hard-mode which was totally worth it. Read my review if you want to know why I recommend playing the game on hard-mode. If you guys have any specific questions about the game then just leave me a comment and I will reply as soon as possible. If you guys want customize the FOV then do this:After starting the game up, the user.cfg will be updated with the r_base_fov attribute. You can find this in %LOCALAPPDATA%\4A Games\Metro LL\. Don't change the FOV to a really high value because it can causes random crashes and character models to look awkward.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am a huge fan of Metro 2033 and Last Light is even better in my opinion. I haven't finished the story yet but so far it has been awesome. These are some of the things that I have noticed so far from playing the game.If you were a fan of the atmospheric underground parts in Metro 2033 then you will love this game even more. The character models and animations are unbelievably good. The textures look great and the lighting/graphical effects are amazing. The textures in this game are crazy good and if you stare very close to the objects, you can see all the tiny details and they are not blurry like in most games that you see today. You need a pretty strong computer to run the game and make sure to wait for the beta drivers from both AMD and Nvidia to play the game. I will talk more about that.The graphics are awesome and when I say awesome, I really mean awesome.  The game looks a lot better than Metro 2033 and I am having no issues playing it on my rig: 3770K overclocked at 4.8Ghz, 16GB of ram and CF HD7970. I have the game set at maximum settings at 1920x1080 and while the game is smooth most of the time, there are still moments when my fps dips below 30 which is frustrating. From what I have read online, it seems that this game isn't very well optimized for AMD hardware at the moment. I'm hoping that the new beta drivers from AMD will fix some of slowdowns that I'm currently experiencing. I will update my review once AMD releases the beta drivers and will let you guys know if there are any improvements.The gameplay in Metro Last Light is excellent and you have almost immediate access to a decent range of customizable weapons that suit numerous combat styles. This makes the game too easy on normal mode which is why I recommend you guys playing the game on hard mode if you want to get the most out of this game. The AI in this game is not perfect and could defiantly use a little bit of work if you ask me. There were a few times where the enemy would get stuck behind objects or not attack me at all.So far the game feels very solid and I easily give it a 10/10 despite some issues with the game being choppy but hopefully the beta driver from AMD will fix that. Now if you'll excuse me, I will go back and finish the game and I will update my review once I'm done with it.My full rig:Sapphire 2xHD7970 @ 1.2 GHz16GB of RAMWindows 7 64bitIntel Core i7 3770K @ 4.8 GHzSamsung 840 Pro 256GB","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AIRTV4WSLL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00885MLL0#wasThisHelpful","R6AIRTV4WSLL2","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I upgraded my old motherboard to this and I'm blown away by the quality of this motherboard. I have been using this motherboard for a few days now and it's been running without any issues. This motherboard is so well designed and the bios is easy to work with thanks to the UEFI technology. Overclocking with this motherboard is super easy and I was able to get my old CPU (1090T) from 3.2Ghz to 4Ghz with no trouble at all. Just change the multiplier in the bios and you are all set.The SABERTOOTH 990FX GEN3 has nice heatsinks that keep the VRMs nice and cool. It comes with AI suite that can auto-tune your settings for your optimal performance but I don't recommend using it because it can cause random crashes. This is the only AMD motherabord that supports PCIe 3.0 which is a huge plus. Future GPUs such as the GTX7xx or HD8xxx will run great on PCIe 3.0!The motherboard comes with four DDR3 DIMM (up to 32GB of ram) slots supporting dual channel memory up to DDR3 1866MHz. I have my ram overclocked to 2133Mhz on this board and it handles it like a beast. There are also a ton of PCIe x16 slots available for both Crossfire and SLI multi GPU. The chipset allows you to utilize two full PCIe x16 graphics cards which is crazy fast. Or you can run four graphics cars at PCIe x8 and still get crazy results. This chipset also includes native support for SATA 6Gb/s which can be great if you have a lot of SSDs in your system like I do.The Asus Sabertooh 990FX/Gen3 motherboard is extremely well designed and it's awesome to look at. Everything is spread out enough that you have enough room to work with. Updating the bios for this motherboard is a piece of cake. You simply go into the bios and it will automatically load the file from your hard-drive/USB and you are done. ASUS has done a fantastic job of creating an amazing motherboard and the new 9-Series AMD chipsets is crazy fast.The bios is extremely well designed and the manual that comes with the motherboard can provide useful information on how to use it. There are two modes in the bios, easy and advanced. The easy mode is great if you need to constantly change boot devices and do basic things but I don't recommend using it for overclocking. The advanced mode on the other hand requires a much better system knowledge and has a ton of options that can be overwhelming at first, but give it time and you'll see how nice it is. It has everything that you could possibly want in a bios.Pros:-PCIe 3.0x-USB 3.0-UEFI Bios-A ton of SATAIII ports-Super Easy to Overclock-SLI/Crossfire capabilities-Good VRM cooling-Sexy color scheme-8+2 VRM PhaseCons:-NoneOverall, I highly recommend this motherboard to anyone who is looking to get the best AMD motherboard on the market. I'm currently running my brand new FX8350 at 4.8Ghz without a hassle thanks to this motherboard. If you plan on upgrading to Steamroller when it's released, then this is the motherboard to get!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFCBXRTH97GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0RCKY0#wasThisHelpful","RZFCBXRTH97GS","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S4 will be the best phone of 2013, mark my words!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4T0O38KB4HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEKXZA6#wasThisHelpful","R2B4T0O38KB4HT","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome.  The phone comes with a ton of bloatware from AT&T(I don't know about other carriers but I assume it's the same) and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware.  I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life.  Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left.  Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome.  My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands.  I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges.  I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5.  I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3.  I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day.  I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone.  Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone.  My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp.  The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching.  I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136).  Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet.  Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me.  The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily.  I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year.  I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands.  It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame.

"I am a huge fan of the first Bioshock and I was a little disappointed with the second one but Bioshock Infinite will blow you away. The environments in Bioshock Infinite are simply breathtaking and Columbia is an amazing place to be and explore. I have spent countless hours just staring at the environment because it is so full of life. You will be amazed at how much detail has gone into making Columbia feel like a real place and making everything fit in. The story line is great and I won't get into too much details but I'll just say that the ending is mind blowing that you won't forget. The sound in this game does an amazing job at creating an incredible atmosphere of love and tension throughout the game.Every tiny detail that has been created for Bioshock Infinite looks breathtaking and fits perfectly within the environment. The developers have done an amazing job at making the environment and the characters feel alive. The character animations are some of the best I have seen in my life. The facial animations are breathtaking when you look into the character's eyes. This game truly shines on PC with everything set to max and cannot be compared to the console version. The lighting in this game is simply amazing and the 3D artists have done an incredible job at making this game feel like a real place. There was quite a few times where I stopped playing just to stare at the environment and just absorb all the details that are around you. My computer had absolutely no issues playing this game at max settings.The skyline rails are an awesome idea that the developers have created that make for fluid, exciting action at all times throughout the game. With the press of a button, you can latch onto a rail with an implement that functions as both a melee weapon and a Skyline hook. Enemies come at you from above and below, and sometimes even from airships that float into range, forcing you to grind the rails to get to higher ground. The player character's special abilities are on the left hand while weapons are on the right. The powers you use this time are called Vigors. You can mix and match them so that you can electrify a flock of crows after flinging them at an enemy.Overall, I really enjoyed this game and I would give it a solid 10 out of 10 because it totally deserves it.Plusses:+Great Gameplay+Jaw-dropping visuals on PC+Mind-blowing ending+Weapon upgradesMinuses:-Some issues with the AI in some casesMy Rig:AMD HD7970 OC Edition16GB of RamI7-3770K @ 4.8 GHzSamsung 840 Pro 256GB","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFI2DTRPJU8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPZ11Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFI2DTRPJU8Y","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead but Crysis 2 was a huge letdown for me. Crysis 2 was clearly developed for consoles first and then ported to PC. Anyways, Crysis 3 SP only took me around 5 hours to beat including all the side missions so it wasn't that bad. The graphics are easily one of the best I have seen and there's no other game out right now that has better graphics than Crysis 3 and that's including BF3, FC3, Hitman Absolution and Metro 2033. Even though I love every single one of those games, I still believe Crysis 3's graphics are far better.The story in Crysis 3 takes place in New York and it's completely transformed into a jungle and vegetation has ripped the city apart. The game opens up with people who are provided with bows and arrows which is different from any other game I have played. Your main weapon will be the bow and it plays an extremely important role in the game. You will find yourself using the bow whenever you run out of ammo and there are several kinds of arrowheads to choose from such as exploding and electrifying. This makes it even more fun to use, and there is not many times when it is not suitable.The graphics are what make this game truly shine and you will need a powerful machine to run it. There are some parts of the game that feels like they are not optimized and you will see your FPS dip below 30 but most of the game feels well optimized. The textures are amazingly beautiful and if you look close to the objects, you can see all the tiny details. In Crysis 2 you couldn't see any detail at all and it was blurry and low resolution. The visual effects are a major upgrade over the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead. The environments look super realistic and feature complex, wide open jungle environment with a lot of destructibility and interactivity.The multiplayer portion of Crysis 3 feels unique and this is largely due to the environment because New York feels different from any other game we have seen before. The arenas are big with lots of hiding places and factors to take into consideration. In addition, there are fun game types, above all, Hunter, where two invisible hunters with just bow and arrow have to hunt 10 Cell-soldiers. Every dead soldier becomes a hunter, making it harder and harder for those remaining to stay alive.Overall, if you are a fan of the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead then you will fall love in love with Crysis 3. The graphics are hands down the best part of this game and it is easily the best looking game out right now. It has an enjoyable story, and a unique multiplayer that has never been done before. I definitely recommend Crysis 3 to anyone and especially to the fans who loved the first two titles. I give Crysis 3 a solid 10/10 simply because Crytek learned from the mistake that they made with Crysis 2.My Rig:AMD HD7950 OC Edition16GB of RamI7-3770K @ 4.8 GHzSamsung 840 Pro 256GB","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51YCV4RIUTM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W3ZZS0#wasThisHelpful","R51YCV4RIUTM2","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original Dead Space will always be remembered as a game that scares the crap out of you and as much as I loved the first two titles, this one falls short in terms of atmosphere. With that being said, everything else feels a lot better in Dead Space 3. The game feels more fast paced than the first two titles and you are never given a moment to rest or even think of what weapon to choose from. I found myself looking behind most of the time because I was so scared of someone coming after me and scaring the crap out of me :D. After having completed the game, I definitely feel like the game was extremely well made and the fans of the original Dead Space will absolutely love this game. The graphics are superb and there are some scenes that really stand out in the game. You will know what I'm talking about when you play the game. The sound is what makes this game stand out from every other game out there. I cannot explain how realistic the sound in this game is. You will have to play the game to find out because there's no word to describe how great the sound is.~Visuals~It's a bit scary how real everything looks in this game with high level of detail in both the environment and characters. The character animations are some of the best I have seen in my life. One of the things that make this game such an incredible experience is the lighting, environment and the artists have done an incredible job at making this game feel like a real place. Some of the environments in the game remind me of Doom 3 which is great because I loved Doom 3. There are some portions of the game where you just have to stop, look around and just absorb all the details that is around you.~Sound~The sound in this game does an amazing job at creating an incredible atmosphere of fear and tension throughout the game. There were some moments where I became so scared because I kept hearing squishy sounds coming from the air vent but I didn't know where exactly that I almost ran away from the computer :D. I honestly believe that the sound in this game is its best and strongest point.~Gameplay~The gameplay in Dead Space is excellent and it gives you a variety of interesting guns. The controls feel great and fluid for most of the time but there were some moments when you get crowded by monsters and it's hard to focus. Creatures are killed easily when you shoot off their limbs but usually take a lot of hits if you're just aiming for the body so it lends a whole strategic kind of thing to the mayhem. The gameplay is similar to Dead Space 2 so that's nice.Overall, I found Dead Space 3 to be an improvement from Dead Space 2. It has amazing graphics, a great story, and one of the most realistic sound experiences you will ever find in a game. The only negative that I can think of is that I found the original Dead Space game to be creepier than Dead Space 3 but that doesn't mean Dead Space 3 isn't creepy because it is. I definitely recommend it to the fans who loved the first two titles because Dead Space 3 will make you crap your pants. I give this game a 10/10 even though I didn't find it to be as creepy as the original game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34I4DB6KC0SFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088TPV54#wasThisHelpful","R34I4DB6KC0SFO","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are someone who has never played any of the Hitman games before, then this is your last chance! I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge and for those who just love stealth games. The gameplay, graphics and the story line of each game is unique and interesting. Out of the three, Hitman Blood Money is easily my favorite because it offers a lot of creative ways to finish off a mission and the graphics are simply amazing.

"I have been using this motherboard for a few months now and it has been running without any issues. I just love this motherboard because everything is so well designed and the bios is easy to work with thanks to the UEFI technology. Overclocking with this motherboard is super easy. You can go from 3.2Ghz to 4Ghz with no trouble at all. I have seen many people get their Phenom X4/X6 CPUs to 4Ghz with no trouble at all on this motherboard. Just change the multiplier in the bios and you are all set.The SABERTOOTH 990FX has nice VRMs that keep it nice and cool. It comes with high quality capacitors and has 8+2 VRM phase that can handle extreme overclocking. It also comes with AI suite that can auto-tune your settings for your optimal performance but I don't recommend using it because it can cause random crashes. I'm sure there will be an update that fixes the issues with the software.The built quality of the 990FX is outstanding and it's awesome to look at. Updating the bios is made easier with this motherboard. You simply download the correct bios from the Asus website and put it in a USB drive and load it up on the UEFI bios and it will automatically update the bios. ASUS never ceases to amaze me with their amazing motherboard and the 990FX is the best motherboard to get for AMD. The new 9-Series AMD chipsets is crazy fast. The only thing I wish this motherboard had was a PCIe 3.0x but it's not a deal breaker for me.The 990FX comes with four DDR3 DIMM slots that supports up to 32GB of ram. It's nice to have that feature because if you are a 3D Artist that does a lot of rendering or animation then the more ram you have the better it is in the end. This motherboard has let me overclock my ram to 2133Mhz it handles it like a beast.There are also a ton of PCIe x16 slots available for both Crossfire and SLI multi GPU. The chipset allows you to utilize two full PCIe x16 graphics cards which is crazy fast. Or you can run four graphics cars at PCIe x8 and still get crazy results. This chipset also includes native support for SATA 6Gb/s which can be great if you have a lot of SSDs in your system like I do.The Sabertooh 990FX is by far the sexiest AMD motherboard I have come across. The bios is extremely well designed and the manual that comes with the motherboard can provide useful information on how to use it. There are two modes in the bios, easy and advanced. The easy mode is great if you need to constantly change boot devices and do basic things but I don't recommend using it for overclocking. The advanced mode on the other hand requires a much better system knowledge and has a ton of options that can be overwhelming at first, but give it time and you'll see how nice it is. It has everything that you could possibly want in a bios.Pros:-AM3+-USB 3.0-UEFI Bios-A ton of SATAIII ports-Easy to Overclock-SLI/Crossfire capabilities-Good VRM cooling-Sexy color scheme-8+2 VRM PhaseCons:-No PCIe 3.0Overall, the Asus Sabertooth 990FX is a great motherboard to upgrade to if you want the latest features on a motherboard such as AM3+, USB 3.0 and a massive amount of Sata3 ports. If you are an AMD user and are stuck on an old socket as the AM2/AM2+ then I highly recommend upgrading to this motherboard. It has absolutely no issues at handling high overclocks and I can run my new FX8350 at 4.8Ghz without a problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HX9B5ETHTY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDJHWM#wasThisHelpful","R28HX9B5ETHTY9","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(+) Multiplayer - I found the MP in this game to fun, interesting and different from other MP games out there. The combat is fast and engaging. Maps are huge and interesting for you to plan your game. One of Far Cry 3's multiplayer modes is a standalone co-op campaign that takes place six months before the main adventure. I have been playing it since the game has come out and it's so much fun.(+) Level Editor - The level editor is absolutely awesome because it gives you the freedom to create anything you want. It allows you to edit the terrain, add objects, vehicles, animals etc. There are an endless amount of things that can be created and added to custom maps, which for any online shooter to have is an absolute dream.(+) Visuals - It's a bit scary how real everything looks in this game, right down to the individual blades of long grass that sway gently in the wind. Complex effects like water, smoke and explosions are rendered beautifully. Distant pieces of the world come into view naturally, with no pop-in.(-) Repetitive Environment - The environment all looks the same which slowly makes the game feel repetitive and boring and I know this is one of the complaints that most people have with the game. I just felt like there needed to be more variety.(-) Glitches - There are quite a few glitches in the single-player that make the experience not as enjoyable as it should be. For example, a glitch that I saw numerous times throughout the campaign was a dead body hovering above the ground or someone stepping into a blazing fire pit instead of walking around it. It's not a deal breaker but it takes away from the realism.(-) AI - The AI in this game is stupid. There were a lot of times were I kept shooting at the bad guys and they wouldn't move or even bother to shoot at me. They would just stand there and not do anything.(-) Story Mode - I personally felt like the storyline was easily forgettable and not interesting but that's only my opinion because there are some people who seem to enjoy it. It has some fun scripted sequences that keep it entertaining, but most of the strong points come from side characters instead of the actual plot. I just feel like the story elements are pretty basic in Far Cry 3. Jason wants to rescue his friends from the pirates and other bad guys, he gets recruited by an opposing faction on the island, and he proceeds to wreck the pirates' operations on Rook Island. That to me doesn't seem very interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RP20B7S9Y9FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088Q8MXA#wasThisHelpful","R2RP20B7S9Y9FF","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(+) Multiplayer - I don't need to explain this one because everyone knows BF3 has the best MP experience you will find in a game. I have put a good amount of hours into this game and it never gets boring or repetitive.(+) Vehicles - Vehicles have always been a huge part of the Battlefield franchise, and it's no different with Battlefield 3, which features a wide selection of popular tanks, helicopters and jets. The vehicles in this game are so real and awesome that you feel like you are in the battlefield in real life.(+) Maps - The maps are large enough to make you feel like you are in a real world and fighting for your life. There are 9 multiplayer maps across 5 game modes. Each map supports each game mode: Rush, Squad Rush, Team Deathmatch, Conquest and Conquest 64.(+) Graphics - Frostbite 2 engine does an amazing job at making this game look realistic and detailed. The lighting in this game really makes this game shine. When I play this game on maximum settings, the game really feels alive and the tiny details that you see on the corners make this game feel real.(+) Sound - While the lighting in Battlefield 3 is excellent, the sound is also amazing. The weapons make realistic sound which is what sets this game apart from the other shooter games.(-) Environmental destruction - For some reason the environmental destruction in BF3 wasn't as real as in Bad Company 2 in my opinion. Only a few of the buildings are destructible in BF3 where in Bad Company 2 almost every building could be destroyed in pieces.(-) BF3 not on Stream - It would have been awesome if BF3 was on Steam. Origin only seems to make things worse with this game. Origin has crashed my game a couple of times. The online server browser is horribly implemented in this game. Steam would have been a much better choice.(-) Linear story mode - While the story mode in SP wasn't the reason why I bought this game but it would have been nice if it had a decent story mode. Nobody buys this game for the story-mode so I don't expect people to really care because BF3 is all about MP.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VRWH0J0ZZ5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WWZUQ0#wasThisHelpful","R9VRWH0J0ZZ5Z","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have spent countless hours playing Anarchy Reigns and it is insanely fun to play and chopping the head off a giant squid with a chainsaw has never felt any better. The combat in this game is amazing and fun. You just never get tired of beating up dudes for no particular reason.Most characters share the same button combos, but they all have their own unique moves, mixed in with their ""killer weapons"" that deal extra damage.  Every character has its own highs and lows, which requires you to constantly plan ahead. Sometimes the game feels extremely spammy because there's so much stuff going on that you don't know where to focus. Sometimes it is literally chaos: all you can see on your screen is dust and limbs, a flying truck smashes you into a wall, and next thing you know there's a pole through your head. Sometimes you're in control, and sometimes you're just getting destroyed by everyone else.  That's not to say it doesn't fit the game because it does.There is a lot of fighting in Anarchy Reigns that is so much fun and awesome but after some time it gets repetitive and boring. Each story mode takes around three hours to finish, and when you finish them there's an epilogue that ties the two together. It's also in the story mode that characters for multi-player are unlocked. Don't expect a whole lot from the story mode because it's not supposed to make any sense.The missions are varied, ranging from defeating a certain amount of enemies within a time limit, to one-on-one battles against enemy agents and gang leaders. Most missions give you three lives and as such the majority can be beaten on either the first or second attempt.The story line is what kills this game because it is difficult to follow and not very interesting. Nothing is explained thoroughly enough for you to understand. I tried so hard to understand it but it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Some of the missions in single player can get repetitive and frustrating to play through because it feels like you are playing the same mission over and over again.The online gameplay in my opinion is where this game really shines. There are over 10 online modes and the majority of these modes are various forms of Deathmatch or Capture the Flag. There is also a survival mode and the unique Death Ball mode which is awesome. While most of them are self-explanatory, Death Ball is basically an insane version of football. There are two teams fighting for a ball, which can be passed or ran into the goal. This usually ends with someone getting killed or the ball going to the other team.Overall I found the game to be very enjoyable and interesting but the lack of the story-line and the repetitiveness in single-player ruined it for me. With that being said, I give this game an 8/10.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KOILY70JLIAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L9WGDA#wasThisHelpful","R1KOILY70JLIAQ","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monte Vista is an Italian themed world centered around Rome. Monte Vista has brought many new elements to The Sims 3 by basing it on an actual country, Italy. I have been to Rome before and I instantly felt like I was in Rome when playing it because the world is full of life and all of the homes are very nice and well decorated to fit with the world. The terrain is beautiful and painted with a lot of detail. I just loved seeing the sprawling hills in the background while playing.Most of the homes are built with lots of open spaces. The landscape of the world is nice and it has been designed beautifully to fit the theme. During the day the world is bright and beautiful with green grass, trees, and beaches. At night the world looks nice with the homes all lit up.The world has a central city area which is surrounded by walls. In the central area is the main square, around it are a few businesses and rich houses. The homes and community lots in Monte Vista are very spacious and fit the overall theme of the world. Most homes are inhabited by Sims but there are a few that are empty that you can move your own Sims into.There are also quite a few empty lots too in varying sizes so you can build pretty much whatever you want. The overall design of the world is beautiful, with a giant hill in the middle, a town center with brand new rabbit-holes, along with the amazing Coliseum Stadium. All the different rabbit holes are built in the same Italian theme as the houses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1H17I4XZCK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A39IEMO#wasThisHelpful","R1A1H17I4XZCK2","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Lenovo X1 Carbon for Christmas and I was instantly blown away by this laptop. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a 14-inch screen and weighs only three pounds. This laptop doesn't just look great, it feels great too. ThinkPads laptops are known for being very reliable and durable and the X1 Carbon is no exception. This is certainly the best ultrabook laptop in the market. It is so elegant, pretty, and sturdy. My laptop came with Intel Core i5, 4GB of ram and 256GB HD which is super-fast for day to day tasks. It boots extremely fast and the screen resolution is pretty good. I just wish it came with a 1920 x 1080 resolution instead of 1600x900. The screen is readable at any angle regardless of the light conditions.The keyboard is the best thing about this laptop. It is a spill-proof keyboard which for me is great because I tend to spill liquids on my keyboard very often. The touchpad is also nice and smooth. I have found that this laptop generates quite a lot of heat when doing intensive multitasking. I use my X1 Carbon for video rendering with Adobe After Effects and it really heats up the laptop after an hour of use. The battery life with the X1 Carbon is the best I have seen. It can easily last for more than 6+ hours with the brightness turned down a little.Overall this is a great laptop for someone who travels or just wants a very light and thin laptop. I have been using this laptop heavily for a week now and have not experienced any problems. I am very impressed and pleased with the excellent build quality. Lenovo has another winner in their hands with this laptop. The spill-proof keyboard is the best feature this laptop has in my opinion. The resolution is 1600x900 which is great but it's not 1080p.Pros:-Spill-proof keyboard-Amazing touchpad surface-Light and sleek-Well built-Good overall performanceCons:-1600x900 is okay but it's not 1080p-Gets pretty hot-No Ethernet port","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2KRFTCTFUUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WJ6FQO#wasThisHelpful","R1X2KRFTCTFUUU","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bios in this motherboard is easy to work with thanks to the UEFI bios which makes it easy to change any settings or overclock. Overclocking with this motherboard is super easy. You can go from 3.2Ghz to 3.8Ghz with no trouble at all. The M5A99X keeps the VRMs nice and cool so you can probably overclock your CPU even higher than normal motherboards can do. It comes with AI suite that can auto-tune your settings for your optimal performance.The motherboard is extremely well designed and it's awesome to look at. Everything is spread out enough that it's easy to install the other components. Updating the bios for this motherboard is a piece of cake. You simply go into the bios and it will automatically load the file from your hard-drive and you are done. ASUS has done a fantastic job of creating an amazing motherboard and the new 9-Series AMD chipsets is crazy fast.Pros:-AM3+-USB 3.0-UEFI Bios-8 SATA ports-Easy to Overclock-SLI/Crossfire capabilitiesCons:-No PCIe 3.0xI recommend this motherboard to anyone who is looking to get a high end motherboard with AM3+.

"This has been my PSU for the last 8+ months and I haven't had any problems with it(knock on wood). Antec is known for making reliable and high quality PSUs so you can expect something that will last you a long time. The Antec EA-650 has a long CPU power cable which is useful if you have to mount the power supply in the bottom of your case. This saved me a lot of trouble because my old PSU had a short CPU power cable that wouldn't have worked otherwise. If you are looking for something like that, then you have nothing to worry abut.The installation was a piece of cake. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it is very quiet. My old PSU used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible. The cables on this PSU are long and the connectors are spaced about 3 inches apart rather than 2 as on most others.I only have only two small issues with this PSU. First, it doesn't have sleeves on the cords which can add some extra insurance. This is not really an issue but I think it would have been awesome if Antec did this. Another issue is about the connectors which are nice but it's not modular so cable routing is a bit of a challengeI can't complain because I got it for less then $60 when it was on sale. :DPros:-Quite-Power Efficient-Power Cord Included-Runs CoolCons:-No Sleeves-It's not modularOverall, this is a great power supply and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something reliable and high quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZZRXM1TDMDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NBZAES#wasThisHelpful","R2AZZRXM1TDMDN","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know where to begin with this one because I have so many bad things to say about this game. First let me just tell you that I am a huge fan of Crysis and Crysis Warhead and I was expecting Crysis 2 to live up to the expectations just like the first two games but it obviously did not. This game is a complete disaster and it's a slap in the face to the PC community.This game was developed for consoles in mind and then later ported to PC. I have never seen a console port this worse in my life. I know that there are quite a few ports out there for PC but never this bad. When you play the game, you can clearly see that the game was made for consoles in mind because the controls make no sense. The developers were so lazy that they didn't even make the controls work like it should on the PC. If you are going to port a game that a lot of people are going to play, then why not go all the way? The graphics and gameplay are dumbed down for consoles. You can just image how terrible it is on the PC just because it is ported.EA has made a BIG mistake with Crysis 2 that has disappointed many loyal PC gamers. The AI in this game is stupid and doesn't even try to kill you. They just stand there watching you kill them one by one. I don't know what EA was thinking when making this game but the story line is laughable. It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm truly disappointed at EA for ruining such a great franchise. I absolutely DO NOT recommend this game to anyone, especially hardcore PC gamers! Bye bye EA because you won't get any more of my money!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GX2HNDY0NKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BS47YE#wasThisHelpful","R16GX2HNDY0NKI","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this laptop two years ago and it has been running great ever since. The Lenovo R400 is designed for durability, and performance. It is a great choice for programmers, and professionals who need an affordable laptop to get their work done. I mostly use my laptop for school work, writing, editing and this laptop goes above and beyond.The touchpad is large, responsive and comfortable to use. I have also used it for CPU resource-intensive programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Dreamweaver. The sound quality is excellent and I haven't had any problems with it. The most amazing thing about this laptop is its spill-proof keyboard which drains liquids away from the internal components. I have twice accidentally spilled coca-cola and the laptop has survived beautifully. My Thinkpad R400 has endured its fair share of knocks and rough treatment without coming to any harm so for that I give this laptop a 5/5.The only thing that I can consider a disadvantage of the Thinkpad R400 is that it's quite heavy and can get annoying to cary in places. It has a nice CPU (Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz) which can handle pretty much everything you throw at it including some light games. It also has enough ram (4GB) which is more than enough these days for intensive applications. My laptop came with a 160GB HDD but I have upgraded it to a Samsung 830 128GB SSD and it flies like the wind. It also has a nice DVD burner which I use quite a lot. The battery is decent, not the best but it gets the job done. For me it lasts around 2hrs with half brightness. I'm still using this laptop and it has never slowed down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128OCJT7H6JC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M700PO#wasThisHelpful","R128OCJT7H6JC6","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been an iPhone fan for a long time and let me tell you that the Galaxy S3 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water. I was skeptical at first about the Galaxy S3 because I was not sure how it would compare against the iPhone 5 but there's no competition because the Galaxy S3 wins hands down. I was blown away by this phone and I can't stop using it everywhere I go. It easily lasts a full day with a single charge and there's always around 20% left at the end of the day which is nice.Even my family who has been using an iPhone since they first came out is blown away by this phone. I have even caught them using my phone when they thought I was sleeping because they just love the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I chose this phone over the iPhone 5 but the main reason is the screen size and the battery. It got to the point where the iPhone was too small for my hands and I'd have to charge it at least four times a day.These are some things that the Galaxy S3 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S3 has a nice 4.8 inch Super AMOLED screen that makes everything stand out when you see it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 720 x 1280 which makes every look sharp. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5(640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way to small for most people.-Android OS: This phone now ships with Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. The phone feels way faster than Android 4.0.4 (ICS) thanks to project butter which makes the CPU work at a high frequency as soon as you touch the screen to reduce lag and slow downs.-Design: I was getting tired of the same design with the iPhone and the Galaxy S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold it.-Camera: The camera on this phone is super awesome and takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. Even the front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: The battery wasn't that good with Android 4.0.4 (ICS) but with the release of Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), the phone lasts me now 2x as long as before. I can get through a day with a single charge and I can still have 20% left at the end of the day.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never be full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures and videos and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play games that require a minimum of 1GB space.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing GTA Vice City that was just released on the highest settings and there was no slow downs whatsoever. I was very impressed.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this? I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone.Cons:-S Voice: Doesn't really work most of the time for me. I have to constantly repeat the same thing so it hears it correctly.-Fingerprint magnet: While this may bother some, this can easily be fixed by buying a case.Overall it's a great phone and doesn't disappoint. With the amazing high resolution and screen size, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S3 is the best phone of 2012.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CMCRJS7XR9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00891PTQM#wasThisHelpful","R17CMCRJS7XR9T","A3223W5IROMYTY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3223W5IROMYTY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been searching forever for a truly sulfate free shampoo and I believe I have found the one. I have tried MANY shampoos in the past and never found one that works for hair.

Burt's Bees Pomegranate & Soy Shampoo has made a difference in the volume of my hair. My hair has never looked this good before. I love how natural the product is. The shampoo foams a little, but it takes a little work to get it throughout the hair. It took me about twice the amount of a sulfate shampoo to fully clean my hair. My hair feels soft and shiny. It has a very pleasant scent and is quite fragrant.

"Released in 1996, Wes Craven's ""Scream"" chronicles the murders of various people linked to a high school in a California town by someone dressed in a ghost-face Halloween costume. Neve Campbell plays the protagonist, Rose McGowan her best friend, Skeet Ulrich her boyfriend, Matthew Lillard his best friend, David Arquette the deputy, Courteney Cox an annoying reporter, Joseph Whipp the sheriff and Jamie Kennedy a dude that works at a video store.People keep hailing ""Scream"" as some kind of stand-out slasher flick, but it's not IMHO. It tries to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which creates an odd vibe throughout. At no time was I able to buy what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming ""This is all a joke,"" like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, the movie's never scary despite some shocking elements and gore.Another negative is the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters. Campbell is serviceable as the heroine and McGowan is awesome just because she's so alluring. Drew Barrymore is also good, but her presence is limited to a glorified cameo in the prologue. I realize that the rest of the characters are so distasteful because this is a whodunit and most of them are potential suspects, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Before you say, ""But this is a horror flick and therefore it's supposed to be unpleasant,"" I get that; I'm talking about how most of the main characters are so repugnant it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I care, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which is so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood you'll just roll your eyes in disbelief. All this is compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose makes sense when you later discover who the killer is.Thankfully, there's some good beyond the three girls noted above (especially McGowan, who's a pleasure to watch), like the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor, but none of these redeem it from being a joke of a slasher. It's worth seeing if you like slasher movies, if for no other reason than to see if it matches the over-hype, but you'll probably be disappointed because of the disagreeable characters and the odd horror/parody fusion, not to mention the cartooniness and contrivances.The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in Santa Rosa, Tomales, Glen Ellen, Healdsburg and Sonoma, California.GRADE: C-","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQRGRBP3E0LZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SIP9MY#wasThisHelpful","RQRGRBP3E0LZB","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1968, Sergio Leone’s “Once Upon a Time in the West” is an epic story of a mysterious stranger known as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who joins forces with a desperado named Cheyanne (Jason Robards) to protect a newly widowed ex-prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin, Frank (Henry Fonda), who works for a railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti).As my title blurb amusingly suggests, this movie is really slow. It’s basically an hour and 25 minute movie stuffed with filler to make it twice as long. For example, a man merely getting off his horse and approaching someone to talk is made out to be an epic blow-your-mind event. Absurd. I'm not saying it's not a good movie; it is and it has numerous attributes, like the great cinematography, outstanding cast and hypnotic score. So it’s definitely worth watching, but you have to be prepped for an epic, slow movie that’s more of a piece of art than a piece of entertainment.Fans of the film defend its slowness on the grounds that it’s an allegory of death. They suggest that the movie’s always revealing and expanding itself until the last act, where it becomes clear how everything’s connected. At this point the film becomes a catharsis as the plot points converge, ending with a duel. Then the picture loudly reveals it theme: The death of the west, the death of gunslingers and the death of the myth. My response: The death of the West and the gunslinger via the encroachment of civilization (here represented by the advent of the railroad) is a constant theme in Westerns, before and since this film. While it’s a great theme for any Western, it was nothing novel in 1968. Speaking of 1968, that was the year “2001: A Space Odyssey” came out, which is sort of the Sci-Fi counterpart to this film. Let me put it this way, if you loathe “2001” you’ll probably hate this one too.Some say that “Once Upon A Time In the West” is very different from Leone’s previous film, the iconic “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” from 1966, but I see a lot of similarities: The epic (overlong) length; the three main characters consisting of good (Bronson), bad (Fonda) and ugly (Robards); a fitting score by Ennio Morricone; and Leone’s unmistakably mesmerizing style.Despite my honest criticisms, this is a notable Western and a one-of-a-kind film, highlighted by Bronson’s laconic hero, Fonda’s villainy and Claudia’s curvy beauty. I can see why some hail it as an artistic masterpiece, but I can also see why others think it’s repetitive and boring. My appraisal falls in between these two extremes, albeit closer to the former.The version I saw runs 165 minutes and was shot in Arizona; Moab, Utah; Sonora, Mexico; and Andalucía, Spain.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLJ8E7IATVO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFYSEA#wasThisHelpful","R1NLJ8E7IATVO7","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL youReleased in 1997, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting.

"Released in 2006, “I’ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer” is about a teen prank gone wrong in a Colorado ski resort town. The youths swear themselves to silence, but problems mount the next summer when it becomes clear that someone knows their secret. Then the bodies start piling up. The teens are played by Brooke Nevin, David Paetkau, Torrey DeVitto, Ben Easter and Seth Packard while Michael Flynn and K.C. Clyde play the sheriff and deputy.This third installment in the series was straight-to-video and therefore lacks the polish of the first two movies. You’ll particularly notice this with the weak pacing and the lesser acting talents of the youthful cast. Despite these flaws, it’s a worthwhile addition to the series because, like the first sequel, they completely switch the location, this time to a ski resort in the mountains of Colorado (albeit shot in Utah). I can’t think of any other film that takes place in this environment so it makes it stand out.I also like how one of the teens, Zoe, plays in a grunge rock band and quite a bit of the runtime involves her band’s practice pad in a barn or them playing out. Nevin is also a plus; she makes for a strong heroine and has a striking face. I further appreciate how the writers actually tied this film to the previous two, which you wouldn’t think they’d be able to do since it’s an entirely different cast of characters in a completely different environment, not to mention it being almost ten years after the first movie.The film runs 92 minutes.GRADE: C+ (or a strong 3/5 Stars)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1321OJ0CLY9ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FSME9M#wasThisHelpful","R1321OJ0CLY9ZZ","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blond obsessed with mating (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).I saw “Species” years ago and, for some reason, developed an eye-rolling attitude toward it; maybe it was due to Roger Ebert’s negative review, I don’t know. In any case, I’m glad I gave it a fresh viewing because this is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin’ woman, she doesn’t do anything for me (I prefer shorter, rounder women) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film’s other attributes.For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there’s more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA (more on this below). Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as “always pointing out the obvious” when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don’t and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we’d see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.While snobby film critics love to hate “Species” it’s a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like “Alien,” “Aliens,” “Terminator,” “Terminator 2” and “Predator” you’ll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as “Aliens,” “Terminator” and “Terminator 2,” but it’s on par with “Alien” (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to “Predator.” Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I’m concerned, “Species” delivers the goods.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.GRADE: A-***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don’t read further unless you’ve seen the movie)The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a “weed killer” from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It’s a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OK237CTQNRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0792833244#wasThisHelpful","R26OK237CTQNRI","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2007, “Decoys 2: Alien Seduction” chronicles events at a Canadian campus where female aliens masquerade as hot blondes and seduce male students in order to perpetuate their dying species. Corey Sevier and Kim Poirier return from the first film, the former as a secondary protagonist and the latter is one of the key aliens. Michelle Molineux plays another notable alien, amongst others, all gorgeous. This time Tyler Johnston and Kailin See star as the student heroes assisted by a few others. Dina Meyer and Tobin Bell are on hand as a psychiatrist and professor respectively.Like the first movie, “Decoys 2” mixes elements of 1995’s “Species” with the campus environment of 1998’s “Urban Legend,” but also adds a subplot from 1999’s “The Rage: Carrie 2” in that the male students compete in a game to see who can bed more hotties. If you like any of those films then you’ll probably like this one, which is on par or better (except I prefer “The Rage” for reasons cited in my review). In any case, “Decoys 2” is cut from the same cloth as its predecessor and might even be a little better. It offers possibly even better women (e.g. Kailin See, Meyer and Molineux) and definitely has better F/X as the appearance of the creatures has noticeably improved. The cast is even better in that a group of students and someone else team-up against the aliens and their camaraderie is a pleasure.While many people hate the Decoys movies I give them a relatively high rating simply because they’re entertaining, which is my main criteria for the worthiness of any movie. Both “Decoys” and “Decoys 2” hit most of the mandatory checkboxes for an effective horror flick. I particularly like the campus-in-the-dead-of-winter locations, which no other slasher/monster flick has done to my knowledge. Speaking of the locations, “Decoys 2” was shot on an Edmonton campus, roughly 2000 miles west of the Ottawa locations of the first film.Maybe the reason horror aficionados dislike the Decoys films is because they add humor and camp. I usually don’t like horror films that mix-in comedy, like 2002’s crappy “Cabin Fever,” but the Decoys films mix them in a palatable way. Neither of these movies is scary, although there are a couple of “got ya” scenes and the aliens are hideous, but they’re satisfyingly amusing with good casts and superb women.The film runs 94 minutes.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VM9TMKOXCZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LXH0AO#wasThisHelpful","R17VM9TMKOXCZN","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Released in 2014, ""Unbroken"" chronicles the true-life story of Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) who ran the 5000 meter race in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later joined the US Army Air Corps for WWII. Upon crashing in the Pacific he and two others (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock) must survive on a raft for almost seven weeks. When found by the Japanese they’re placed in a POW camp and suffer the wrath of the commandant (Miyavi). Will they survive?Directed by Angelina Jolie and scripted (partly) by the Coen brothers and based on Zamperini’s biography by Laura Hillenbrand, this is a totally realistic account of Louie’s war-time trials and was a minor hit at the box office. What was it like being in the air on a bombing mission over Japan taking hits by nigh-suicidal Jap planes? What was it like to survive on a raft in the Pacific week after week? What was it like to live in a Japanese POW camp? “Unbroken” shows you without amping-up the melodramatics and action. This explains why some viewers call it “bland” and what have you. They’re so used to “Die Hard,” “GI JOE” and 007 that movies that aim for real-life bore them. That said, I don’t want to come off as a film snob because I DO understand their criticism. It just comes down to what you want out of a movie, real-life or blockbuster theatrics? So before watching this movie you have to psychologically prepare yourself for a film akin to other realistic war biographies, like 2002’s “The Pianist,” 2006' ""Rescue Dawn"" and 2014’s “American Sniper.” If you want “Spectre” you should skip “Unbroken.”The movie is long enough as it is and therefore doesn’t depict Louie’s later PTSD and alcoholism or his Billy Graham-inspired reconciliation to God, although it mentions these things in the postscript. In any case, “Unbroken” accomplishes precisely what it set out to do, put Louie’s story to film for the world to see, and it does it very well. It may not be exceptional like 1957’s “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” but – being a biography – it never set out to compete with that film.The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in eastern Australia.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWTQDLDNBKMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTDC9O#wasThisHelpful","R3BWTQDLDNBKMW","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Released in 2013, ""The Last Stand"" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as an aging sheriff of a small border town in Arizona. When a drug kingpin (Eduardo Noriega) escapes FBI custody and apprehends a suped-up corvette to make it to Mexico, the sheriff & Co. are the only ones who can stop the thug from freedom. The members of the sheriff’s cadre are played by Luis Guzmán, Jaimie Alexander, Rodrigo Santoro, Zach Gilford and Johnny Knoxville.At some point during the first act the movie struck me as a cinematic descendent of 1977’s “The Gauntlet” mixed with elements of the mythic Western. Later on, a car is blown full of holes in an overdone and amusing way followed by an aggressive bus sequence, both reminiscent of that Eastwood flick. While the tone is quasi-realistic, there’s an amusing edge. I also like the camaraderie of the deputies and the sub-themes of redemption and honor above filthy lucre.

"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, “Earth vs. the Spider” details the events of a small town in Southern California when a colossal spider living in a cave comes to town.While “Earth vs. the Spider” is great when you’re 8 years-old its flaws surface when viewed as an adult. For one, the spider’s size changes according to the sequence: In the cave it’s huge, but when it’s on display at the school it’s noticeably smaller; then when it traverses the town it’s gargantuan. Inconsistencies like this don’t make for great movies. It’s entertaining in some ways, like being a period piece of the late 50s, but it pales in comparison to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951) and the monumental “Forbidden Planet” (1956). It doesn’t help that colossal animal/monster movies made in the decades since are just all-around better, including being in color.

Still, “Earth vs. the Spider” is worth catching if you favor these kinds of flicks and want to go back in time to the late 50s, not to mention there are some effective elements, like the horrific sounds the spider makes and the drained remains of its victims.The film runs 73 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California, with additional footage from Carlsbad Caverns National Park.GRADE: C","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCY20GWO8YA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000092WA5#wasThisHelpful","R2UCY20GWO8YA0","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, “I Married a Monster from Outer Space” stars Gloria Talbott as a newlywed in Southern Cal who starts to suspect her husband is an alien from outer space (Tom Tryon).Despite the silly title, the tone is serious and the special effects regarding the aliens and the way they possess people (or whatever) are quite good for the era. Right from the get-go the viewer knows who’s being taken over and we then observe the protagonist slowly figure it out, which leads to a well-done confrontation between the wife and non-husband. The second half reveals why the aliens do what they do and it’s kinda melancholic. All this points to why it’s considered a minor cult classic. Movies like this are worthwhile simply as historical artifacts to view American society in the late 50s, but compared to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951) and the monumental “Forbidden Planet” (1956) “I Married a Monster from Outer Space” is second rate.The film runs 78 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California.GRADE: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF5FQIAEDSQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEDP6H0#wasThisHelpful","R2UF5FQIAEDSQI","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1959, “Teenagers from Outer Space” chronicles a small group of English-speaking humanoid aliens who investigate Earth as a possible breeding ground for their staple food-supply, Gargans, which are essentially giant lobsters that stand vertical. One of the aliens, Derek (David Love), rebels against the others on the grounds that Earth is inhabited by intelligent humanoid beings. Dawn Bender plays Derek’s possible romantic interest while Bryan Grant plays Thor, a particularly malevolent alien.If you can ignore the lameness of the non-special effects and overdone or underdone melodrama, the story is well done in ways and Derek & Dawn are likable protagonists. The movie’s also worthwhile simply as a historical artifact to observe American society in the late 50s. However, compared to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951) and the monumental “Forbidden Planet” (1956) “Teenagers from Outer Space” is dissatisfactory and cheesy, not to mention the title is dumb and disingenuous. It can’t even compare to 1958’s “I Married a Monster from Outer Space” (another dumb title, but at least it’s accurate).

"Released to2001, ""Wooly Boys"" stars Peter Fonda and Kris Kristofferson as two aging sheep ranchers in the Badlands of North Dakota. After the former pays a visit to his daughter (Robin Dearden) in Minneapolis, he brings back his city-bred 16 year-old grandson (Joseph Mazzello). Keith Carradine plays a country sheriff, Rosanna DeSoto a ranch hand and Michael Booth an FBI agent. Jad Mager and Adam Logan are on hand as troublemakers while T. Mychael Rambo plays a hearse driver.This dramedy focuses is on the conflict-habituated friendship of the two older ranchers and the visiting teen being a fish-out-water in the wilderness, which brings to mind 2003’s “Secondhand Lions.” At around the 30-minute mark there are several laugh-out-loud scenes, which are less frequent throughout the rest of the movie. The lines of the idiotic FBI agent are the best. Beyond this, the cast and authentic North Dakota locations are great, but the movie’s mediocre about half the time. For instance, the kid responds to Kristofferson’s character in one scene and it’s wholly unconvincing. A top-of-the-line movie would re-do the scene or ad lib; whatever it took to make it work. So it’s one of those part good/part meh movies, but I think the good makes it worthwhile, like the laughs, the birthing scene, the cast and the ND locations.The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in Fryburg, Beach & Medora, North Dakota, and Minneapolis.GRADE: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C8YSTLWB9P58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007N19XM#wasThisHelpful","R1C8YSTLWB9P58","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2012, ""Come Morning"" is a backwoods drama/mystery about a grandfather and grandson (Michael Ray Davis & Thor Wahlestedt) and their misadventures when taking a hunting trip in backwoods Arkansas. The screenplay focuses on the downside of masculinity, rural property disputes and death.The story evidently takes place in 1973, which I didn't know until after watching the movie because country folk today generally wear the same kinds of clothes as they did back then and drive similar old trucks, etc. In other words, there's no observable reason it couldn't take place in modern times. Another minor issue is the way the story switches to flashbacks without indicating it to the viewer. Of course I was able to gather that it was a flashback, but why not use an appropriate device to indicate this to the audience?Regardless, the movie has a great haunting ambiance with a quality score, excellent woodsy photography and good actors, all reminiscent of the haunting rural atmospherics of films like 2010's ""Winter's Bone,"" 2008's ""Frozen River"" and 2006' ""That Beautiful Somewhere."" It's the least of these, however, no doubt because of the $46,000 budget, which resulted in too many holes in an already ambiguous story. Moreover, while the plot's fine, the script is too mundane and fails to create a compelling experience.My wife and I watched the movie separately yesterday and neither of us could figure it out. The story provokes questions, but the ending fails to deliver the answers. We're not the types who need to be ""spoon fed"" answers. In fact, we enjoy figuring movies out and usually can; see my review of 2001's ""Wendigo"" for evidence. Unfortunately, too much of ""Come Morning"" remains a mystery; even after watching (most of) the director's commentary to find answers. We found some answers, like the identification of the character of Morrigan (Elise Rovinsky), whom we thought was simply the kid's mother, but that's not the case. ***MILD SPOILER*** The story ends with someone's ring found in someone else's possession and neither the movie nor the commentary reveal the significance of this. So this character has a certain person's ring on him, so what? Before you answer, ""The ring is supposed to incriminate so and so,"" I get that, but incriminate him for what? Hunting in a prohibited area? Whoopee. Don't tell me he'll be incriminated for murder because (1.) it doesn't apply to the dead person in question and (2.) just because someone has another person's ring in his/her hand doesn't mean much. No matter how you slice it it's a weak ending.***END SPOILER***The director and the other commentator reveal that they weren't able to include a lot of scenes from the original script, either because they didn't have the money/time to shoot them or they did and the footage was unusable for one reason or another. As such, there are just too many holes in the story and it leaves you unsatisfied. The director/writer makes the viewer work hard, but then fails to provide answers. Yet the story's not very compelling anyway; so even if they were able to include more revelatory material it still wouldn't help the mundane nature of the proceedings. That said, ""Come Morning"" is worth catching just for the mysterious backwoods cinematography and score, not to mention the quality actors; that is, if you appreciate the aforementioned similar films.I hope the director makes more films because he's got talent, but he's going to need bigger budgets to do so effectively, plus improve his script-writing skills.The film runs 80 minutes and was shot in Cleveland County, Arkansas.GRADE: C- (or a weak 3/5 Stars)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3PT8WAUV3VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIQ7YYU#wasThisHelpful","R3T3PT8WAUV3VG","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2013, THE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOOD is the seventh studio album by Death Angel. It’s a good release with quality production (comparable to their previous album RELENTLESS RETRIBUTION) and it’s definitely their thrashiest recording since their 1987 debut, THE ULTRA-VIOLENCE, but—overall—the songs simply aren’t as good as the songs on their four previous albums, ACT III (1990), THE ART OF DYING (2004), KILLING SEASON (2008) and RELENTLESS RETRIBUTION (2010). The good news, however, is that THE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOOD is a very kinetic album and it’s great to put on when your jogging or working out.While I appreciate Death Angel’s thrashier numbers, what’s always made Death Angel stand out, for me anyway, is the way they balance out the more speedy numbers with amazing acoustic/creative/experimental parts, and sometimes whole songs. While there are brief intros, outros and mid-sections like this on THE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOOD, they’re less significant in favor of an all-out thrash assault.  The exception would be the closing 80’s Metallica-like song “Territorial Instinct / Bloodlust,” which is arguably the best song on the album. “Detonate” is another one, but it gets pretty manic and could almost be categorized with the thrash tracks. Nevertheless, “Detonate” is a highlight, as are the title track, “Left for Dead” (with cool thrash attack in the middle of the song) and “Succubus.” “Fallen” isn’t far behind.Unfortunately, too many of these songs flash by without enough distinction and too much yelling, like “Caster of Shame” and “Empty,” which isn’t to say these are necessarily bad songs. It all comes down to what you want out of a Death Angel album. If you want blood, you’ve got it with THE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOOD. However, if you want more variety you’ll have to go back to ACT III, THE ART OF DYING, KILLING SEASON or 1988’s FROLIC THROUGH THE PARK (my least favorite). A friend of mine insists that THE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOOD is their best since their reunion in the early 2000s whereas I say it’s their least because there aren’t any songs that stand with greats like “Opponents at Sides,” “The Devil Incarnate,” “Words to the Wise,” “Dethroned,” “Soulless,” “God Vs. God,” “Volcanic” and practically every song on ACT III.While all of Death Angel’s seven albums are worth getting, this is how I rank them:ACT IIITHE ART OF DYING (rough production, but excellent & distinguishable songs)KILLING SEASONRELENTLESS RETRIBUTIONTHE DREAM CALLS FOR BLOODFROLIC THROUGH THE PARKTHE ULTRA-VIOLENCEGRADE: B-","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3T0MBGL6C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIEPP0O#wasThisHelpful","R3I3T0MBGL6C8","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2002, “The Pianist” is Roman Polanski’s account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they’re carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. He’s dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.Like 1993’s “Schindler’s List,” “The Pianist” is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. In any case, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you’ll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony “blockbusters.”Some have complained that Szpilman’s a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That’s why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that’s not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What’s he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would’ve been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman’s a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he’s the hero of the story.The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. “Schindler’s List” shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas “The Pianist” shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while “The Pianist” is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.The movie runs 2 hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6H8VHRM5JEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FVQLRA#wasThisHelpful","R2T6H8VHRM5JEP","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m just poking fun at the sounds the Zuni doll makes.Released to TV in 1975, ""Trilogy of Terror"" features three stories by Richard Matheson, the only memorable one being the last, “Amelia,” which involves a creepy Zuni doll. All three stories star Karen Black:1. “Julia” (25½  minutes): PLOT: A sinister college stud seeks to manipulate a mousy English teacher whom he thinks is hot underneath her drab demeanor. EVALUATION: This one’s not bad, but it’s nothing great either. GRADE: C+2. ""Millicent and Therese"" (20 minutes): PLOT: Two sisters, one puritanical and the other satanic, are evaluated by a doctor. EVALUATION: This is the dullest and most predictable of the three, but it’s so short it’s over before you know it. GRADE: C-3. “Amelia” (25½ minutes): PLOT: A woman living in a high rise apartment brings home a Zuni doll that she bought for her boyfriend, an anthropology teacher (the Zuni People, by the way, are a Native American tribe, most hailing from the Pueblo of Zuni in western New Mexico). The doll comes with a scroll claiming that it contains the spirit of a Zuni warrior named ""He Who Kills” and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. When the chain falls off horror ensues. EVALUATION: While I busted out laughing for several minutes when the doll initially goes on the rampage (more for personal reasons than because the film’s unintentionally humorous), this segment becomes legitimately harrowing and is quite creative, not to mention the F/X are effective for a TV movie from the mid-70s. The ending is memorable and Karen is outstanding.

"Wow, this album just blew me away. I've heard of Wretch for many years, but never heard them until recently. They're from NE Ohio with a history extending back to the mid-80s. They have several albums out and have played at European festivals, like in Greece, where they're more appreciated. I think I avoided them so long because of their name. Big mistake. I recently heard this album on Youtube and quickly picked up a CD. Every song has its distinct sound and is as good as the next. No kidding. If you like bands like early Fates Warning, Helstar, Maiden/Priest, Sanctuary, Queensyrche, Metal Church, the less thrashy side of Forbidden and SYMBOLIC-era Death (but with clean vocals) drop everything and purchase this album. The production is obviously low-budget, but you can make out every instrument and the mix is great.There's almost an hour worth of music; here are the songs with my comments on each:1. “Into Madness” (1:08): This is just an intro.2. “Sleepless Dreams” (6:24): Starts with a nice Priest-like intro (e.g. “Victim of Changes”), which is wisely re-visited later in the song. There’s a sweet acoustic interlude, albeit brief, and an even better classical epilogue.3. “The Ones” (3:25): Begins with a Steve Harris-like bass part that segues into a chipper Maiden-ish dittie.4. “Warriors” (4:26): Starts Helstar-ish and turns very Manowar-ish (e.g. the lyrics) with some battle-oriented sound effects thrown in.5. “Fallen from Grace” (4:01): Despite the metal riffing this is a melodic haunting song with hooky parts here and there.6. “Sacrifice” (4:52): Cool track that throws in some Maiden-gallop then morphs with a great course change.7. “All I See” (6:02): Metal parts switch to acoustic during the verses and back to metal for the chorus, but don’t think “Beyond the Realms of Death” or “Children of the Damned” because it’s not hackneyed.8. “Sword and Stone” (3:27): This is one of the best songs on WARRIORS—melodic non-hair metal at its finest with surrealistic guitar parts. These boys know how to play!9. “Death and Innocence” (5:27): One of the lesser songs on the album, but still good.10. “Never Alone” (5:51): Another standout track; see comments on “Sword and Stone” above. There’s a cool bass-led vocal melody later in the song.11. “Watching the World” (5:40): This is my favorite song on the disk. Everything works for an ultra-hooky traditional metal number. The stanzas are particularly memorable.12. “In Those Eyes” (3:40): An awesome ballad—beautiful, reverent and moving.13. “Rain” (3:58): Solid closing track of melodic heavy metal with a cool start/stop riff thrown in.This is metal of the highest caliber. You just put on the album and enjoy from beginning to end; there are no clunkers.GRADE: A(I'm going to have to pick up the rest of Wretch's discography because WARRIORS is the first and only album of theirs that I've heard).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLXI8YJZFWOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU861WO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLXI8YJZFWOU","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2013, SURRENDER TO NO ONE is Chastain’s ninth studio album and marks the return of original singer Leather Leone after being replaced by Kate French for three albums.I bought 1987’s THE 7TH OF NEVER when it came out and immediately became a fan of Chastain's high energy metal with elements of prog and sometimes classy goth. I suppose today it would be designated as power metal, but it’s not power metal in the sense of D&D-oriented European bands, which don’t appeal to me. I owned Chastain’s first four albums (and they were actually albums), but lost track of them after that because I assumed by the cover of 1990’s FOR THOSE WHO DARE that they had taken a commercial direction and I was always into the heavier side of metal; then they acquired a new singer in the mid-90s and I still assumed they had taken the pop approach. I’ve since learned the error of my ways and that Chastain never betrayed their ideals by becoming shallow hit-seekers. I’ve heard the Kate French albums and they’re just as good in their own way as the Leather ones, although I still feel THE 7TH OF NEVER is their best album with 1988’s THE VOICE OF THE CULT running a close second. I must confess, however, that I find the more recent stuff, like 1997’s IN DEMENTIA, just as good (I know, I’m being redundant).Led by main-man David T. Chastain, guitarist & composer, Chastain hails from Cincinnati and their form of metal is just timeless, like all great music. This explains why SURRENDER TO NO ONE sounds like late 80’s Chastain. The music was timeless then and it’s timeless now. This is such a dynamic album. You can tell David just wanted to go into the studio (his own, I’m sure) and knock out an album’s worth of songs without second guessing. It may be 23 years since Leather last sang on a Chastain recording, but she sounds the same. Speaking of which, I was never one of her biggest fans; at the same time, I didn’t dislike her either. In fact, I've always loved her palpable passion. My issue is that her vocals show little variation and sound the same from song to song, sorta like Dio. Regardless, she fits the band, just as Kate did for her three-album stint, and I accept her (and French) as a vital part of the Chastain equation.Anyway, this is a great album to put on when you’re working out or jogging. It’s just so high energy. The production is weak in the sense that there’s a samey-sounding quality to some of the songs, but the more you listen the more you’ll distinguish them. The opener “Stand and Fight” is a highlight. Like most of the songs it’s lively and compelling. “I Am Sin” is another standout just because it’s slows things down to nigh doom metal; it's the same with the closer ""Bleed Through Me."" The aggressive title song is another high point. Really, the entire album is worthy Chastain material and stands well with their other songs. For their next album, however, they need to tweak the production to differentiate between the songs better, like they did on THE 7TH OF NEVER, THE VOICE OF THE CULT and IN DEMENTIA.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LVS305796Y74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEDP67K#wasThisHelpful","R3LVS305796Y74","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1957, “Forty Guns” is a B&W Western that revolves around an authoritarian rancher, Jessica Drummond (Barbara Stanwyck), who rules an Arizona county with her private entourage of hired guns. When two marshal brothers arrive to set things aright (Barry Sullivan and Gene Barry), the cattle queen finds herself falling for the former. Both have young brothers who are problematic. Eve Brent plays a curvy gun-maker.The movie has a number of positives:-  The opening sequence is great with its apocalypse of thundering horses led by Jessica on a lone white horse (symbolically?).- The tornado sequence is well-done with Jessica getting dragged by her horse and her subsequent monologue after the storm, hooking up with Griff (Sullivan).- Eastwood's renowned “Unforgiven” (1992) was obviously influenced by “Forty Guns”: Both feature a remote town without justice or law and order, an existential wasteland. Crooked, murderous Sheriff Logan (Dean Jagger), embodying the breakdown of social order, is similar to Hackman in “Unforgiven”; and his suicide is very eerily done. A blind marshal (Worden) is a literal joke on ""blind justice"" and another symbol of the impotence of law & order.- The long shoot-up of the town by the “wet-nose” Brock is grand mayhem. In “Unforgiven” the attack on the prostitute by two young cowboys (also referred to as ""boys"") serves as the same type of initial, youthful, anarchic transgression which has to be set straight.- A gruesome, dressed-up corpse in a coffin, put on full display on the main street, with accompanying, hand-written vindictive placards, is also seen in “Unforgiven.” In each it’s a grotesque slap to decency and civilization.- The town ambush of Griff by Charlie Savage (fitting name) next to a row of empty coffins is effective, particularly the straight-up vertical shot of the window with the assassin's rifle sticking out.- While the ""Woman with a Whip"" song is dated, ill-fitting and corny, the score is otherwise suited to the content.- The stylish, irreverent way the movie strays from Western tradition reveals it to be the precursor to the (mostly lame) spaghetti Westerns of the 60s.- Other highlights include: The shot of Wes's widow in black against the sky; the leitmotifs of the foal and hearse, representing the extremes of birth and death; the comedy at the baths; the sexy female gunsmith seen through a rifle barrel, a jarring juxtaposition of the feminine and force, as is the case with Jessica.Because of these positives “Forty Guns” is often touted as a groundbreaking Western. While true, it's also a decidedly average 50’s Western filled with unbelievable dialogue/characterizations and deliberately contrived scenes, not to mention the story’s just dull and it’s shot in B&W.  Just because it strays from the mold of traditional Westerns doesn't make it a good movie.The film runs 79 minutes and was shot in Arizona.GRADE: C","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRP3CV99NY0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007PALOI#wasThisHelpful","RMRP3CV99NY0X","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2003, “Monte Walsh” chronicles the mundane adventures the title character (Tom Selleck) & Chet Rollins (Keith Carradine) and other itinerant cowhands in remote Wyoming in 1892-93, with an epilogue taking place in 1900. Times are a changing as Easterners with “capital” are making “conglomerates” of the big ranches and there’s not enough work for cowhands to go around. Can these old cowboys adapt to the new century? Isabella Rossellini plays Monte’s romantic interest while George Eads and William Devane play Shorty and Brennan respectively.Being made-for-cable (TNT), this newer version of Jack Schaefer’s novel lacks the sheen of, say, 2003’s “Open Range,” but it’s not far off in overall quality and shows that a superlative Western can be made on a TV-budget. I’ve seen the 1970 version, but it was so long ago that I can’t compare the two.The movie starts out dull as it shows the everyday life of the cowhands, but I caught a grip with the realistic vibe and was fully immersed into the story by the second half where the story perks up. Besides the realism, I liked the palpable love displayed between Monte and his babe, as well as the subplot of desperate men doing foolish things in desperate times. Monte makes a big mistake when he lets a certain character go when he’s caught rustling. He should’ve made sure he got his just deserts. The story is nigh elegiac in tone as we witness the limited opportunities for these tough Westerners as their way of life is stifled by progress. “Monte Walsh” is akin to similar Westerns like 1967’s “Will Penny,” which was hampered by its subplot of cartoony villains. “Monte Walsh” has no such flaw.The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBA9N8ZE35C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B187NO#wasThisHelpful","R3BBA9N8ZE35C6","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2000, “The Virginian” was the fifth movie version of the 1902 novel by Owen Wister. Bill Pullman directs and plays the titular character, a cowboy promoted to foreman on a remote Wyoming ranch. He falls for a schoolmarm newly-arrived from back East (Diane Lane) who’s shocked by the “uncivilized” violence and justice she observes. John Savage plays the best friend while Colm Feore plays the main villain. Harris Yulin and Dennis Weaver are on hand as the big ranch owners.This is the only film version of the story I’ve seen and, I’ll be honest, it’s a hard movie to catch a grip with. To appreciate it you have to bear with the first half, paying close attention to the mumbling dialogue, which paves the way for a worthwhile second half. Also keep in mind that this isn’t a rollicking shoot-‘em-up Western; it’s more of a realistic drama in the Old West with flashes of Western staples, like hanging rustlers and saloon confrontations.  It has the look and tone of 2003’ “Open Range,” but lacks the budget, since it was made-for-cable (TNT). While I love rousing Westerns when they’re done right, like 2002’s “American Outlaws,” I prefer the more realistic approach, like 1990’s “Dances With Wolves” or 1992’s “Unforgiven.” “The Virginian” is similar in tone and locale to these movies, but is hampered by its TV-budget.The good news is that the locations, cast, cinematography, score and plot are all top caliber; unfortunately, the low-budget is glaring at times. For instance, there’s a scene where the cowboys are forced to bring some horses down a steep hill and the entire sequence comes off awkward. I’m sure director Pullman felt the same way and tried his best to make it make sense in the editing room. With a higher budget he could’ve taken more time shooting that particular scene or done reshoots, but with the limited funds he had to make do with what he had. There are other scenes where I had to stop and think, “Okay, what’s really going on here” and was eventually able to figure it out. This occasional lack of clarity was probably the result of cramming a 300-page book into a 95-minute movie.The above explains my relatively low rating (6/10), but I’m still giving it a marginal thumbs-up because the movie’s very worthwhile if you’re willing to put in the time and effort. Somewhere during the second half I stopped TRYING to like it and was involved with the story and appreciated the filmmaking (photography, music, actors, etc.); I was just focusing on understanding the dialogue.The schoolmarm and the government agents represent the encroachment of civilization to tame the West and men like the Virginian. The former succeeds while the latter can’t handle the sometimes savage environment and suffer accordingly. While the protagonist understandably falls to the charms of the former the failure of the latter leaves him no recourse but to carry out justice, Western style.The film was shot in Alberta, Canada.GRADE: B- (or a weak 4/5 Stars)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HRCD0R1411C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A92ME5S#wasThisHelpful","R8HRCD0R1411C","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1993, “The Beverly Hillbillies” is a cinematic version of the hit TV series that ran for a decade from 1962-1971. The story details the family of hillbillies from the Ozarks striking it rich and moving to Beverly Hills where they’re strangers in a strange land.I’ve never really watched the TV series, although I’ve of course seen clips here and there. Unlike 1994’s “The Flintstones” and 1995’s “The Brady Bunch Movie” and their sequels, “The Beverly Hillbillies” isn’t nearly as effective, not even close. The cast is good and there are amusing moments, but once the family moves to Southern California the story is uninvolving and you find yourself biding time waiting for the next gag. Sometimes it’s downright bad, but there’s enough good to glean for a mildly fun time.

"Released in 2002, “The Count of Monte Cristo” chronicles Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) betrayal by his best friend (Guy Pearce) and a magistrate (James Frain) in 1815 and his ignominious exile to a prison isle for the next 13 years where he discovers a mentor (Richard Harris). His misfortune causes him to forsake God and fuels his thirst for vengeance. Will he get it? Will he reunite with his beloved (Dagmara Dominczyk)? Alex Norton has a small role as Napoleon Bonaparte.While the first half follows Dumas’ long 1844 novel, the second half deviates. The screenwriter said he purposely wasn't making it like the book because he wasn't trying to recreate it. He wanted to do his own thing and there’s nothing wrong with this, particularly since it’d take a miniseries to do justice to the novel.The movie is entertaining because it throws in everything but the kitchen sink – pirates, Napoleon, secret messages, romance, friendship, envy, betrayal, dungeons, escape plots, swashbuckling, comedic elements, a treasure map, French high society, revenge, redemption and family; and does this in just over two hours. I’d give it a higher grade, but the story is sometimes unrealistic in a melodramatic way, sorta like the miniseries North and South if it were put on the big screen.The film runs 131 minutes and was shot in Hollywood/Burbank/Los Angeles.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IQJX36LG04H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006ADFM#wasThisHelpful","R37IQJX36LG04H","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As of this writing (2015), Meliah Rage has 8 studio albums and 9 if you count 2002’s “Unfinished Business.” Released in 2009, MASQUERADE marked their reunion with original singer Mike Munro after Paul Souza took over the mic for two albums – 2004’s BARELY HUMAN and 2006’ THE DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP. The reunion would only last one album, as Munro had other obligations, and Souza would return for one more album, 2011’s DEAD TO THE WORLD. After that the band enlisted Marc Lopes for their 2014 album WARRIOR.The problem with MASQUERADE is that it’s the follow-up to the band’s best two albums – the aforementioned BARELY HUMAN and THE DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP – where they just knocked it out of the ball park with great songs like  “Barely Human,” “Ungodly,” “Wrong Place, Right Time,” “Man and God,” “Twisted Wreck,” “The Last of the Wanted” and several others. While MASQUERADE is a solid American power/thrash album it simply suffers by comparison.Another problem is that Souza was an overall improvement over Mike Munro. He has a more unique sound whereas Munro comes off as James Hetfield with a slight southern twang. Don’t get me wrong, I like Munro, but Souza has a way of making the songs come alive and soar.An additional issue is that MASQUERADE takes the opposite approach to Munro’s previous album with the band, 1996’ DEATH VALLEY DREAM, where the entire album consisted of short, catchy songs. MASQUERADE, by contrast, focuses on longer songs with only three of nine clocking in at around five minutes. The rest are all between 6-8 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind long songs and was once in a band that composed tracks that typically ran 6-8 minutes, but the length of the first three songs on MASQUERADE hinders one’s appreciation of the album. The first three songs comprise 21 minutes of the album! As such, I always have a hard time distinguishing between these songs, although “Chosen” is nice and thrashy in an 80’s Metallica way and “History Will Tell” possesses a nice groove.It’s not until the fourth track, “Dreamer,” that I really start getting into the album, which is a catchy thrasher, as is the closing “Whatever it Takes.” “Seeker” is a haunting slower tune that morphs into groove metal in the second half and then returns. “Hour Glass” is solid metal while the title song takes a more experimental path, which is refreshing. “Last Rites,” interestingly, is sung by Metal Church’s former singer Ronny Monroe and it’s cool to hear his voice and high screams.At the end of the day, however, the songs -- while solid -- aren’t exceptional. Something prevents them from soaring and, for me, I think it’s Mike Munro’s vocals. Either Souza or Lopes would’ve made these songs soar one way or another. Also, while I appreciate Munro’s overtly spiritual lyrics they come off one-dimensional here and there. There are ways to incorporate biblical themes into this style of music, but you have to be careful not to be redundant. You know how the proverb goes: “If you find honey, eat just enough -- too much of it, and you will vomit” (25:16). THE DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP and DEATH VALLEY DREAM took the more intriguing route and are the better for it.Despite my criticisms, this is a solid power/thrash album in the mold of 80’s Metallica, Metal Church and Bathory’s Viking era. It’s definitely worth getting if you’re a Meliah fan, it’s just that IMHO it’s the least of their last six albums as of this writing (2015).GRADE: B-","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8JI1VFZ8SME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ME4NBS#wasThisHelpful","R1J8JI1VFZ8SME","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1988, “Elvira, Mistress of the Dark” stars Cassandra Peterson as the zany title character who moves from Hollywood to Falwell, Massachusetts, where she inherits an old, creepy mansion. Elvira is a hit with the youths in town and makes a couple friends, but the majority find her offensive and want her out. Meanwhile her uncle is obsessed with getting a “recipe book” from the mansion for some diabolical purpose.Cassandra was 36 during filming and looks great throughout (as do her stunt doubles). Ellen Dunning (Robin) gets an honorable mention on the female front. While only half the humor works (the other half being groan-inducing) there are several laugh-out-loud sequences, like the parodying of The Price Is Right and “Flashdance.”Christians might find the portrayal of the intolerant townsfolk offensive, but (1.) the movie’s a comedy/parody, not a depiction of real-life; anyone who takes this seriously needs to visit the psych ward; (2.) the movie amusingly denounces counterfeit religiosity, i.e. sterile legalism, and not Christendom itself; and (3.) the ending pretty much makes up for the negative portrayal.What I find somewhat annoying is the continual wisecracking that pegs Elvira as a loose woman, to put it nicely. While her long black dress reveals mega-cleavage and the upper part of one leg, it’s not exactly prostitute attire; plus the story shows Elvira interested in only ONE guy, which hardly constitutes a loose woman.BOTTOM LINE: This is a worthwhile turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-good-time flick with Elvira. Fans of cartoony horror comedies like 2006’ “Monster Night” and Scooby Doo should appreciate it.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Hollywood/Burbank/Los Angeles.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30HOJWMJ1DB7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053TWV5K#wasThisHelpful","R30HOJWMJ1DB7G","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2000, “Unbreakable” was M. Night Shyamalan’s follow-up to his most successful movie, 1999’s “The Sixth Sense.” The plot revolves around a man (Bruce Willis) who becomes increasingly aware that he possesses superhuman abilities, including invulnerability. This attracts a man on the opposite end of the spectrum who can barely go a week without injuring himself (Samuel L. Jackson). The latter is seriously into superhero-type comics and begins to see the truth about the former. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play the wife & son of the protagonist while Leslie Stefanson has a glorified cameo.The movie scores high points for originality as the idea that superheroes are based on real-life people adorned with extraordinary powers is intriguing. The tone of the movie is akin to the slow drama with spiritual undertones of Shyamalan’s other films, like 2002’s “Signs.” Unfortunately, the ending feels arbitrarily tacked-on and leaves a sour taste.

"Released in 2007, “Live Free or Die Hard” is the fourth installment in the Die Hard series. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a youth hacker (Justin Long) who’s targeted by cyber-terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel and Mai Linh (Timothy Olyphant & Maggie Q). Their goal is to create chaos by taking over the USA’s transportation grids and stock market. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane’s cute and feisty daughter while Kevin Smith has a small role as a computer geek.Some people complain that this sequel is “Die Hard in name only” for various reasons, which I can’t verify because I’ve only seen the first one and that was many moons ago. As a stand-alone action flick with Bruce Willis it delivers. The story holds your attention while the action scenes are out of this world. They’re so over-the-top that some write the movie off as absurd, but everything’s done with a quasi-realistic tone so it helps the viewer go along with the ridiculous things that happen rather than tune out. “Live Free or Die Hard” is the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977’s “The Gauntlet” where the action scenes are so overdone they’re cartoony, but entertaining. There’s a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001’s “The Mummy Returns,” but “Live Free or Die Hard” evades that ditch by giving us fairly interesting characters and a compelling story. It may not be great but it certainly fills the bill if you’re in the mood for a wild action flick.The movie runs 128 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2ZLD503C9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VNMMR0#wasThisHelpful","RM2ZLD503C9X","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2000, “Rules of Engagement” is about two Marine officers, Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hodge (Tommy Lee Jones), who have a relationship going back to Vietnam. Childers is charged with murder after leading a team to the Yemen embassy to save the Ambassador and his family during a  violent “demonstration” (more like an all-out attack) and calls on Hodge to defend him. To save face, the National Security Advisor (Bruce Greenwood) wants Childers to be the scapegoat at all costs, disregarding blatant evidence to the contrary. Can Hodge, an alcoholic and mediocre lawyer at best, save his buddy who once saved his life? Guy Pierce plays the prosecutor while Ben Kingsley & Anne Archer play the Ambassador and his wife.This is a war-drama by the maker of 1973’s “The Exorcist” and 1977’s “Sorcerer” similar in tone/plot to 1992’s “A Few Good Men.” I like “Rules” better, despite some flaws (like being contrived). It may not have an iconic line like “You can’t handle the truth!” but it has quality combat action (which “A Few” didn’t have) and the story of the protagonists is just more compelling IMHO. The movie’s effectiveness hinges on Jackson and Jones convincing us of their characters, their relationship and their crisis, which they easily do. Some critics have decried the film as “racist” (naturally), but it’s more like telling the awful truth with 2012’s infamous Benghazigate scandal lending support.  Director Friedkin said the movie’s not anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and certainly not anti-Yemen, it’s anti-terrorist. Bear in mind that the King of Morocco had to read and approve the script before the filmmakers could use Morocco for locations and nobody participating from the Arab side of things felt the film was anti-Arab.One critic complained about a peripheral character not resurfacing at the end, but why pan a story for NOT being predictable?The blurb at the end makes it seem like the movie was based on a true story, but it's not. It simply reveals what happens to the characters after the story ends so the viewers aren’t left in the air.The movie runs 128 minutes and was shot in Morocco (substituting for Yemen), South Carolina (Vietnam), Virginia and Washington DC.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFFPEADG72J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00003CXGV#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFFPEADG72J6","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1973, “The Legend of Hell House” details the experiences of four investigators of a haunted mansion in England over the course of five days. It’s a risky endeavor because there was only one survivor of past investigators (20 years earlier), the character played by Roddy McDowall. In other words, the house killed ’em all! The other cast members are Pamela Franklin, Clive Revill and Gayle Hunnicutt.I saw 1959’s “House on Haunted Hill” earlier this summer and was struck by its lameness. “The Legend of Hell House” came out a mere 14 years later and it’s a significant improvement, as far as creepy ambiance and realism go. If you appreciate movies with spooky atmospherics you’ll want to check it out. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Richard Matheson (from his book), turns the story into a series of disjointed vignettes over the course of five days in the mysterious house, which prevents the movie from creating momentum. You might be wondering how this is a flaw because, after all, how else would you chronicle such a story? But there’s a way to do it where there’s a sense of cohesion, like 1971’s “The Devil Walks at Midnight” (aka “The Devil’s Nightmare”). Nevertheless, the movie has undeniable positive elements and is worth checking out if you like haunted house movies or the cast.The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in England.GRADE: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQSIPUY3NNHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LIRD#wasThisHelpful","RHQSIPUY3NNHC","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 2011’s “A Warrior’s Heart” Lutz plays a skilled lacrosse player who’s not much of a team-player. His family moves from California to the East Coast where he learns to deal with his hotheadedness. Ashley plays his girlfriend and Beach his Native mentor while Gabrielle Anwar and Chris Potter play his parents.To be honest, I didn’t know much about lacrosse until viewing this movie. Turns out it originated with the Iroquois, inhabiting what is now New York, Pennsylvania, and other parts of the NE America. In some aboriginal traditions the games lasted all day for 2-3 days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, to give thanks to the Creator or Master.This was a small production, only costing $2.5 million, but it’s generally well made with a likable cast and quality soundtrack. Some people have criticized it as predictable, but this is only true in the sense of the sports film maverick who must be broken in order to be a team-player, which ultimately ushers in victory. Beyond this, I wasn’t able to predict where the story was going, like a certain person’s sudden meltdown and the arduous wilderness lacrosse camp.The cast is great, but it felt like the story needed something more to hook the viewer, such as edgier drama or deeper subtext, but something. Another flaw is the final game where it’s clear there aren’t that many people in the audience (or maybe lacrosse doesn’t draw that many spectators, but this was a NATIONAL championship). Another glaring flaw is that the wilderness camp is supposed to be in the Northeast when it’s clear that it’s Southern California. A superior sports movie of this low-budget sort is 2010’s “Cutback” (see my review). Nevertheless, “A Warrior’s Heart” is a must for fans of lacrosse or sports movies in general, not to mention fans of Lutz, Greene and Beach.The movie runs 86 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita (College of the Canyons) and Pasadena, California.GRADE: C+ (almost B-)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBMAJGDN5XAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G6GU9M#wasThisHelpful","R2GBMAJGDN5XAG","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That pretty much sums up 2011’s heralded “The Help,” which stars Emma Stone as an aspiring journalist who encourages black maids (Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer) to chronicle their experiences for an article as the Civil Rights Movement kicks into full gear in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. Bryce Dallas Howard is on hand as the uppity biyatch and Jessica Chastain plays an amiable Marilyn Monroe-ish housewife.I like films that involve rural blacks, like “Mississippi Burning” (1988) and “Waterproof” (2000), and “The Help” falls into this category. The movie provides a window into early 60’s Southern culture and the plight of black women. Despite being snooty, Bryce looks great and Jessica looks even better, nice and curvy (she reportedly gained 15 lbs. for the role, which I wish she’d keep). Emma is effective as the protagonist, but she’s too good-looking to for the role since it calls for an early 20s woman who’s never been asked out on a date. Why sure!

"This 1997 TV movie by Andrey Konchalovskiy is an almost-three-hour rendition of Homer’s Odyssey, the epic Greek poem that details Odysseus’ decade of wandering from one adventure to another after his victory in the long Trojan War, trying to make it back to Ithaca, Greece, and his beloved Penelope. Armand Assante plays Odysseus, Greta Scacchi his wife and Alan Stenson their son. Some of the numerous guest stars include Isabella Rossellini, Bernadette Peters, Eric Roberts, Christopher Lee, Vanessa Williams and Michael J. Pollard.While the cast, locations and score are excellent, the story is conveyed in a relatively dull manner in the first half and is hampered by the manifestations of “the gods.” Yes, I realize the filmmakers’ were only trying to be true to Homer’s epic, but some of these manifestations are eye-rolling and take the viewer out of the story. This explains why 1954’s “Ulysses” and 2004’s “Troy” played down this element or cut it out altogether. However, after the first half you start to accept it as part of the adventure/fantasy and roll with it, particularly because the second half is nigh exceptional, starting with the crew’s confrontation with the three-headed Scylla, which is a truly horrific sequence, and then the entire final act, especially the action-packed fight between Odysseus & his son and the brutish suitors of Penelope.Assante isn’t larger-than-life as Douglas was in “Ulysses,” but he evokes Odysseus’ intelligence, guile, and versatility, as shown in the poem. Once you catch a grip there are some potent scenes/acting, like the initial revelation of Odysseus with various Ithacans. Furthermore, some parts have a palpable spiritual quality. Unfortunately, it does take a while to get into the groove, but the second half is more than worth it (not to mention the score and the magnificent Mediterranean locations).Lastly, some people have erroneously summed up the moral of the film as “Don’t anger the gods.” While this is true on the surface, the subtext is way more than this and totally applicable to reality. It’s revealed in the second half: *** SPOILER ALERT*** Odysseus was condemned to wandering from crisis to crisis for a decade because of his arrogance after his victory at Troy. Before finally returning to Ithaca we observe a humbled and enlightened man. This is the core theme. Once Odysseus is humbled a potent nugget of wisdom is revealed: Sometimes it's necessary to temporarily kowtow to the arrogant in order to assess the situation and bide your time for an effective strike.The film runs 176 minutes (the VHS 165 minutes) and was shot in Turkey and Malta.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UADBBVTJDF1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005N913#wasThisHelpful","R3UADBBVTJDF1T","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in late 2014, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is the third part in the franchise based on Suzanne Collins' popular books. A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and others (Natalie Dormer) from the obliterated District 12 go to the supposedly destroyed District 13 to hook up with President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her associates (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Mahershala Ali) where Katniss becomes the ""Mockingjay,” the symbol of revolution for the oppressed districts of Panem.  Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson are also on hand.I’m not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I’ll watch ‘em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This second sequel is a natural extension, but there isn’t a lot of action and the drama isn’t very compelling, but it’s okay. It comes across as drama for teenage girls, which shouldn’t be surprising since that’s the target audience of the books. Nevertheless, Jennifer’s a likable protagonist and I appreciate the realistic air and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept. It just needs more oomph, which I hope we’ll get with the final film.Lorde's song during the credits is a highlight(""Yellow Flicker Beat"").The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Georgia, Germany and Utah (the lake where Katniss sings).GRADE: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7OLMKJ6DHXPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYLT0OW#wasThisHelpful","R7OLMKJ6DHXPM","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released to TV and video in 2001, “Sea Creature” is about a couple of carnies (Rufus Sewell & Carla Gugino) in the early 20th century who come across a real mermaid in Ireland (Rya Kihlstedt), which they apprehend and intend to transport to America as a freakshow attraction. Horror ensues. Reno Wilson and Gil Bellows are also on hand.Originally called simply “Sea Creature” the movie was unnecessarily burdened with the overlong title of “Mermaid Chronicles Part 1: She Creature,” which doesn’t make sense since there’s no “Part 2,” although the ending leaves room for that possibility.The movie plays like a modern-day Hammer flick with elements of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” “Species” and “Alien/Aliens.” While it lacks the budget of those three films, the production is comparable to those Victorian era Hammer movies. “Sea Creature” also shares similarities to 1961’s haunting “Night Tide” with Dennis Hopper, which also was about a (possible) mermaid.There are three basic settings in the movie: The opening carnival sequence that segues into a (sorta) castle sequence and, lastly, the long ship sequence that takes up the bulk of the story. That last one reveals the greatest weakness of the movie in that sailing in a ship is a limited setting, which makes for a little dullness here and there, but the flick makes up for it with an over-the-top horrific last act. The renowned Stan Winston was on hand as producer and you can tell with the excellent F/X of something revealed at the end, which is on par with the Aliens, Predator, and Pumpkinhead movies. No kidding.While a TV movie, “Sea Creature” is adult-oriented in that the mermaid is top-nude the entire movie (the horror, the horror!) and there’s at least one overt simulated sex scene. Don’t fret, however, as the movie was shooting for realism and not raunch. Moreover, redemption and comeuppance factor into the equation.BOTTOM LINE: Despite a couple of dull or dubious scenes, “Sea Creature” delivers the goods for those who appreciate Hammer’s haunting Victorian-era films, as well as movies like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” although understandably no where near as lavish as Coppola’s film. Carla shines in both beauty and acting chops, as does Rya (who’s been married to Bellows since 1994); and Sewell plays a superlative protagonist. “Sea Creature” shows that a quality product can be made on a TV budget.The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in California.GRADE: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTUUZUERI05P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005YUNQ#wasThisHelpful","RPTUUZUERI05P","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1999, “Mickey Blue Eyes” is a romcom starring Hugh Grant as, Michael, a New Yorker Brit working as an art-house auctioneer. He's in love with a woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who’s family is Mafia. Michael thinks he can marry her and not get entangled with organized crime. Think again.I’m not big on romcoms, but this one kept my interest throughout, even though some jokes fall flat and the story sort of fumbles in the last act. While it’s only occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, it’s consistently amusing. Grant is a likable protagonist and James Caan is amiable and entertaining as the mobster father.

"I was interested in seeing “Jurassic World” (2015) because (1.) I love dinosaurs, (2.) I love island adventure and (3.) it’s the third top-grossing film in cinematic history, as of this writing. I thought that it would be at least be as good as the first movie (1993), which – contrary to popular opinion -- I never felt was great because the story and characters were never that compelling. Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective. Despite my criticisms, I gave the film a solid grade of “B” or 7/10 Stars.The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up?While “Jurassic World” is better than the two previous movies it’s not as good as the first one. In fact, the plot’s pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that it’s 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boy’s hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but she’s not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.Actually, that’s the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so it’s not just me. The writers should’ve worked-in the older brother’s girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.GRADE: B-","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0KJ57GNVJ3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC5II0#wasThisHelpful","R3J0KJ57GNVJ3Z","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Terminator Genisys” (2015) is the fifth movie in the Terminator franchise. The plot is an amalgam of the first three movies with cyborgs traveling back in time to kill or save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) before she gives birth to the leader of the formidable Resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Like the first film, the “future” father of John, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), also goes back in time to inevitably meet and fall in love with Sarah. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the series as an aging, but not obsolete, Terminator.The fourth film, 2009’s “Terminator Salvation,” distinguished itself by taking place completely in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, The Resistance.  While different, this installment failed to be compelling because it sacrificed characters for wall-to-wall action and CGI, which resulted in dull overkill.“Terminator Genisys,” by contrast, tries to mix quality character bits in with the action. Unfortunately, while reminiscent of the first three films, it fails to stack up, copping a “been there, done that” vibe. It’s like a slick-yet-pale rendition of the first two installments. People criticized the third one (2003) for this very reason, but at least it came within sighting distance of the first two. “Terminator Genisys” doesn’t even come that close. Still, it’s a decently entertaining popcorn flick with some highlights and amusing moments. As for me, I say just watch the first three, particularly the first two. Why waste time with a wannabe? Unless, of course, you’re a fan of the series, like me; in that case you basically HAVE to see it.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot in California and New Orleans.Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings:T1: A+T2: A+T3: B+T4: CT5: C+","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEMHLC2TR0M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013I9DU#wasThisHelpful","R1LEMHLC2TR0M1","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fantasy-adventure based on Homer's epic poem The Odyssey, Kirk Douglas is larger than life in the title role and Silvana Mangano is spellbindingly beautiful in the dual role of Penelope/Circe. Most importantly, the story & script are compelling. The Cyclops sequence is a highlight and the F/X are surprisingly good for 1954. Moreover, the climax when Ulysses is revealed after posing as a beggar is dynamic. Sometimes it's necessary to temporarily kowtow to the arrogant in order to assess the situation and bide your time for an effective strike.In my humble opinion this version is better than the 1997 rendition with Armand Assante, ""The Odyssey,"" because it's more streamlined, lacks the eye-rolling manifestations of the gods and it's hard to beat Douglas' imposing portrayal. However, ""The Odyssey"" is still worth checking out since the effects are more modern and there are some quality cast members and effective sequences, particularly the crew's horrific confrontation with the three-headed monster, Scylla, and the entire final act.The movie runs 117 minutes and was shot in Italy, the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa.GRADE: A","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFZ2C4NLEC5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DZOCY6#wasThisHelpful","R1OFZ2C4NLEC5X","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While The Black Panther first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 in 1966, he didn't get his first solo comic until Jungle Action #6 in 1973. Written by Don McGregor, the issue was the first in a multi-part storyline called ""Panther's Rage,"" which detailed the Panther's return to his native kingdom of Wakanda, Africa, after superheroing in the USA for a few years. In Wakanda he discovers revolution afoot led by the merciless Killmonger and his various cronies (Venomm, Malice, Baron Macabre, King Cadaver, Lord Karnaj, etc.) and does his best to quell it.While there were other multi-part storylines in Marvel Comics at the time, such as the excellent Spider-Man/Jackal/Gwen Stacy clone storyline, the Captain America outlaw/Secret Empire series and the Daredevil/Black Spectre storyline, ""Panther's Rage"" was different. It was the first storyline created as a complete novel. It ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages. The story arc has been referred to as Marvel's first graphic novel.Yet that wasn't the only thing that made ""Panther's Rage"" different. While it was Marvel with its typical superhero/villain melodramatics, it was somehow deeper, more sophisticated. Regardless of the jungle antics (the panther vs. this or that villain/animal) McGregor's accompanying prose provoked wonder, like ""What was this REALLY about?"" ""Did I understand this?"" ""Maybe I should read it again?"" These comics made you really think. While you were tempted to skim through the mag quickly you couldn't. McGregor's writing demanded attention as every word had to be read and savored, every panel scrutinized and appreciated.Speaking of which, the art is fabulous throughout ""Panther's Rage,"" as well as the ensuing ""Clan in the USA"" issues, an unfinished storyline. The pencils are by Rich Buckler, Gil Kane (one issue) and Billy Graham with inks by Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod.One last important thing that differentiated The Black Panther from other Marvel Comics at the time -- it was the first to feature a black superhero with a predominantly black cast of characters, plus set entirely in Africa (until Jungle Action #19, that is, when the Panther returned to America to face the Clan). Yes, Luke Cage debuted the year before, but it had several white characters and was set in New York City.While expensive, I encourage you to pick up this Marvel Masterworks edition that features ""Panther's Rage"" in one volume, plus the other issues and extras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZGV21C7YMEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785141987#wasThisHelpful","R1WZGV21C7YMEL","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015) is a quality superhero team movie. The first movie (2012) was so overhyped that it was almost impossible NOT to be let down a little. It started good, but the set-up went on & on and wasn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time was spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which created a somewhat one-dimensional vibe; lastly, although Loki was a worthy villain, his army of Chitauri were stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who were basically just canon-fodder for the Avengers.I like this one better because the “origin” element is out of the way and the setting isn’t one-dimensional. There are numerous locations (England, Seoul, Bangladesh, South Africa and Italy), and additional characters like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Ultron (voiced by James Spader) makes a worthy villain and the over-the-top action sequences are balanced out by quality character bits, like the Black Widow/Hulk/Banner relationship. Furthermore, the third act delivers with the requisite earth-threatening crisis.When I heard Olsen was going to play Scarlet Witch a couple of years ago I was disappointed because she definitely didn’t have the curves to pull-off a woman like Scarlet Witch, but she obviously gained weight for the role and looks great. She has a striking face and is quite a convincing actress. Taylor-Johnson is fine as Quicksilver, but I can’t help wondering why they didn’t use Evan Peters, who played the character in 2014’s “X-Men: Days of Future Past.”There are so many quality superhero movies at this point that a new one is pretty much just more of the same. So “Avengers 2” creates a bit of a “been-there-done-that” vibe, but it’s well done for what it is. What makes me grant it a fairly high rating, besides the positives already noted, are a couple of moving parts, the subplot about Thor’s hammer and the revelation of another character in the third act that I wasn’t expecting, which elicits a “Wow” reaction if you’re familiar with the comic and even more so when you observe the tie-in to the aforementioned hammer.Lastly, there’s a lot to take in with “Avengers 2,” which makes it worthy of repeat viewings.The film runs 141 minutes.GRADE: A-","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193NQG3AIM039/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8QXC#wasThisHelpful","R193NQG3AIM039","A3O536E2YOKK4Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O536E2YOKK4Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Released in 1962, “Carnival of Souls” stars Candace Hilligoss as a young woman who survives a vehicle accident in Lawrence, Kansas, and then is troubled by a specter (director Herk Harvey) and other strange occurrences as she moves to the Great Salt Lake area for a gig as a church organist.This is an eerie, moody  cult flick, but not scary at all. It’s similar in vibe to 1961’s “Night Tide” with Dennis Hopper. The creepiest part is the girl’s lecherous neighbor in Utah (Sidney Berger). Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension can’t be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm.

"Have any Celtic blood in you? Then this is a sweater you want! It looks like my grandmother's tartan, in fact.

It is worth it!I'm about a perfect man's medium but I've taken to buying sweaters and even some jackets in SMALL to get a good fit. So, buy the small if you are a medium and buy the medium if you are a men's large (but not fat). Sweaters stretch. Sweaters keep you warm from October to April in North America.The small crew neck, waist, and arm cuffs are about tight enough although I like a tighter and more substantial neck but this is how it should be for this type of sweater..Wear this over a dress shirt with a wool sport coat (or at least your North Face jacket or parka) and you will be comfortable. And classy. This is preppy wear. And that's good. Dressing like a rapper is so last decade.Despite the high cost of this Polo Ralph Lauren Men's Lambswool Suede Crewneck, I may order another just in case this gets stolen (yes, even your brother might do that!) or it gets stained with spilled coffee as you write your great American novel, stained with grease as you fix your '63 Corvette, or eventually eaten by moths (search Amazon for moth balls).Wool (lamb's wool in this case) sweaters aren't to be thrown in the washing machine. Hand wash cold with Woolite, press dry carefully on a towel, dry flat. This isn't a sweatshirt imitating  a sweater - it is a real sweater that requires some care.

"My FIVE star rating means ""I love it!"" The back story is that I am an unashamed Amazon fanboy. The only thing I look for in an Amazon produced product (or any other) is will it suit my needs.The new Fire 10 HD is most certainly what I hoped it would be. The setup (it downloads updates) can take an hour or so (while you explore its features - while plugged in to its included small power brick). Mine had about a 60% charge right out of the box.I had pre-ordered mine a few weeks earlier. It came on the day promised. To prevent moisture damage it arrived with the actual unit in a shrinkwrap plastic which I left in place until my screen cover arrives (just punched a hole in it for the power cable and the earphone jack).Just like a Windows installation, it will give you the chance to select the level of privacy you want. Amazon, to help it sell you more stuff, hopes you grant it the ability to hoover up details of your photos, browsing, etc. I declined most of that. You can change your selections later.If, like me, you have bought music on Amazon the Fire 10 will list all selections available for you to hear online or download. BTW I bought the 32GB version. I would have bought a larger capacity if it had been available. But I suppose Amazon will bring out a more advanced version of this product in a year or so.Background on my tablets/phones: my first Fire was the original with (I think) just 8GB of memory. It's now obsolete and has a date with the crusher. Within this past year I bought the Fire Phone (the one Amazon just discontinued selling). Shame - it love it, too. Best phone I ever had. Flawless operation.I wanted a new tablet to replace the aforementioned original Fire tablet as well as an original Apple 64GB tablet, also obsolete. I have the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 also bought within the last year. I like that a lot, too. But I still wanted a tablet of 10"" to 12"" which would work well for reading the books, music, and videos I buy on Amazon.Unlike many of the earlier reviewers (which I haven't read since they include fanboys of other devices as well as the usual suspects who have a wishlist of features a mile long which no material device can satisfy), I have taken a few days to try the features the Fire 10 Tablet ACTUALLY has.Since the technical features are shown extensively on the Amazon page for the Fire 10, I'll just say it does everything rather well. I just watched a PRIME download of the film ""Transformers: Extinction"" which played flawlessly using my 130Mbps router download speeds. Your WiFi service should take the blame if video or any other aspect of the online performance is lacking.Speaking of internet performance, the Amazon browser and general performance of Amazon's OS is extraordinarily improved from my original Fire. It keeps track of what you are doing but dumps memory on inactive processes (as it should), and dims and shuts off the screen  promptly to conserve power. Viewing a long movie (Transformers) the power on battery only went down hardly 40%. So, you could get at least two long movies on a flight, in the car with kids, etc.The main screen not only has the specialized screens shown as tabs at the upper part, but all you have to do to move along the screen selections is swipe the large screen right or left like most cell phones will do. The latest Fire OS is excellent. Take a few days of exploring the SETTINGS button features. If you think you have a problem, go there. You can adjust all sorts of operating parameters - no need to get upset and call Amazon for help. You are in charge of this talented machine! Learn how to use it to its fullest.And nobody uses printed manuals anymore for devices like this. Just play around with it. You won't break anything. Have fun exploring it!For those who say it won't do everything an iPad or other Android device (Fire OS is based on Android but produces it's own flavor) I have news: It's not supposed to! It will do many similar things (including running Google apps if you are willing to take the trouble to learn how to do that - it's technique is online). But this is the Soul Of A New Machine, like that book by Tracy Kidder from the MiniComputer era, Remember that?The Fire 10 HD is designed to get and keep you in the Amazon ecosystem. THAT'S IT! Anything more than that, from Amazon's viewpoint, is just icing on the cake. As an Amazon fanboy I'm content with that. I've already shopped using the Fire 10 and have placed my first order (for a screen protector film).BTW, I bought the non-sponsored version. Pay no attention to the complainers who didn't and are now complaining about pop-up ads. Tough! Spend a little more. If you can't, don't buy a device like this. The competing tablets don't have a sponsored version for cheapskates. They just charge up to a 50% premium on the cost of their tablets.As mentioned earlier, my ability to read my extensive purchases of books, and listen to my extensive purchases of music flawlessly in a larger format than previously was a major reason I unhesitatingly ordered this. I have enjoyed trying its features with perfect results every time.The 128GB microSD card I ordered at the same time just arrived a few days after the Fire 10 HD. It's a little fiddly to insert it in the jack on the right side at the top. Just goose the tiny plastic cover and it swings down. Insert the card with the contacts facing back and press firmly (maybe a few times to make sure). Do this while the Fire 10 is OFF. Cards don't like to be put into ""hot"" circuits. Turn the Fire 10 on and press the SETTINGS button, go to STORAGE, select the card and you will see that the default is to allow the unit to download videos, music, books, apps, etc. to the card. That takes a load off the core memory of the unit and it should run better in the long term. A category 10 card is recommended. Earlier card specs might not be optimum.Also, I tried pairing the bluetooth in the unit to my bluetooth enabled table radio and it works well. I stream my Amazon music purchases to the Fire 10 and listen on my good quality radio. Even so, the tiny speakers in the Fire 10 aren't too shoddy. But a modern film deserves top sound reproduction to enjoy those roars, thumps, booms, shots, yells, and background music.The unit is twice the surface area of my original Fire tablet and it's about half as thin. It is FAST, FAST, FAST. The Fire 10 internet browser brings up pages just as fast as my quad core CPU powered desktop computer which is on high speed Ethernet, not the 5GHz WiFi that the Fire uses (2.4GHz also available). Use 5GHz internet WiFi if you have it available through your router. There is lots less interference from other neighborhood users slowing the speed.You can find an adapter available to plug an HMDI cable into  the Fire through its micro USB jack to put the screen to your TV. It does have mirroring, too, but I haven't tried that.Batteries used in devices like the Fire 10 are not user replaceable so it's best not to run it flat but instead recharge when it's no less than 40% or so. Keep the total discharges to a minimum. These types of batteries are designed to accept only a certain number of charges. If you can, use it mostly in one place and keep it on the charger cord most of the time. Save the mobile uses for special occasions.You may get years of use from this. The battery in my original Fire tablet still works. The batteries in my older iPods still work. At the pace of technology today, obsolescence is what kills devices. But remember that Amazon builds these Fire 10s to a price point. Drop it, a kid pounds the screen with his fist, it gets left in a wet place ... All bets are off.These are not military spec devices. They have a Planned Obsolescence factor which may just allow it to survive until a new model arrives. Some won't. The truth is: No one NEEDS a Fire 10. It's just built to keep us amused until something else comes along.RECOMMENDED","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXA4HNGMY79S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAR8FSC#wasThisHelpful","R2JXA4HNGMY79S","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Chocolate Fudge flavor is my favorite in the think Thin High Protein bars.

But for what they are, keeping you on a diet of limited calories for at least one meal a day, they are worthwhile.High protein foods, avoid carbs, eat salads and other low calorie vegetables and you might start regaining your optimum weight. I think these can help. Just don't eat ten of these a day! They are listed as having around 230 calories. They are coated in chocolate flavor but are not anything like a chocolate bar, for sure.

"Alright, I admit I am a sweater freak - is my fifteenth (sob!). Though one dates back decades and most of the others I have bought in the last ten years or so. But I didn't have a Nordic style sweater until I saw this on Amazon and ordered it straightaway.Although the expected delivery date was still three weeks in the future, I got it today - from England, no less - shipped with signature required. Better be home when this is delivered by the USPS or you'll have to make a trip to your post office to fetch it.I'm pretty much a perfect man's medium. Since I wised up about how men's medium sweaters, jackets, and other garments that fit around the torso are cut for fat men, not for slim men like me, I ordered the SMALL size.Bingo! great fit. This is a European sweater (also called a pullover or jumper) and as such it has a longer back length and longer arm length than is typical for men's sweaters sold for the United States market. The wool/cotton 50/50 blend yarn makes this less itchy and less likely to inflict an allergy reaction on one.The white on black design is likely to be unique in your local neighborhood if not the entire city or county you live in. Nordic designs are hard to find in a sweater (it was hard enough to find my latest ski-design sweater) and you will have the distinction men seldom encounter of being uniquely dressed, not to put too fine a point on it.I would call this a medium thickness simply because I have a couple of Aran knit sweaters which I would call very thick. Some might call this a very thick sweater but I found today, with temperatures of 50F it was just right for a walk of a few miles with a brisk wind as well.It was sold at full list price of 90 euros or US$136. Expensive but worth it. Shipped double bagged and it arrived undamaged and unopened from England to New England in only ten days. This may be my last sweater - really! at least until next winter ...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC4RCKWNZXUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGLHLMW#wasThisHelpful","R3VC4RCKWNZXUM","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The excellent photos of this Rothco camouflage show what you will get: a very practical bit of poly fleece which will fit over the neck but also can be pulled up to cover the nose, lower face, and ears. So, all you need is a warm hood or hat to deal with extreme cold in your camouflage outfit.Frankly, it doesn't look to be such a radical camo design and coloring that you wouldn't wear it around town. I have a headband of about the same design that I've used for years. These artificial fleece items last a long time and stand up to regular washing.You can also pull this up over the head, showing only the face. But covering the face is an important task for this item. It does, from my actual use with my camouflage parka, an excellent job of covering up that white flag, your face, which keeps you from being seen by game or in wild animal photography. Just get a camo hat or use your camo hood as well.The camo pattern is muted, not extreme like my camo parka, but it blends in well. You can breath through it when it is over the nose and mouth, but in extreme cold, ice will form on it. Still, in hunting season temperatures, this should do well. It is well made, fits, and is a necessary bit of kit for winter.

"A little schadenfreude on the price of this beautiful nordic style scarf: I ordered two of them and paid only US $8.00 for each. Not made of wool or cashmere but of an attractive and comfortable synthetic fiber.This well-designed scarf is about 55 inches long and about 6 inches wide. It is thicker than many scarf fabrics. Each end has a tapered, knitted end in white. One side of the scarf is white on blue and the other the reverse.Frankly, I didn't know what to expect from this purchase. It arrived after about 20 days from Hong Kong via New York. I can imagine getting it a little sooner from a major retailer in the U.S., like Orvis or Eddie Bauer, but paying about five times as much.I think this is a quality item. It's a sleeper.

"I got these to go along with my Sessions white snowboarding parka which I bought a few years ago. That parka has become my favorite winter parka because of its breatheability, roominess, sealing, and good looks. I find I can wear it over a wider temperature range than parkas with goose down or dacron filler. It's the parka I grab the most when heading out around town even, but it has serious snow sports potential.So to these Sessions Serenity Snowboard White pants. Same quality construction, roomy, long hem length, generous pockets including on on the lower left leg. The pockets have snap, zipper, and velcro fasteners to keep stuff in, and to keep snow or rain out. These are not cream colour, but a bright white. This combination of Sessions white parka and pants is literally a survival outfit on the slopes or anywhere outdoors in winter in northern climates. Put it on over your street clothes and you are ready for any vigorous outdoor activity in winter conditions. Got to shovel a long driveway, this is what to wear.Like the parka, these pants have interior hems to keep out snow at the pant hem area and to wrap around your boot. Then, too, I just like the contra-intuitive bright white colour of these in winter snow conditions. Want to be visible? wear a black hat. Much of the time in winter we are dealing with having to be outdoors at twilight or after-dark conditions in which a white colour will be a distinct advantage in respect to visibility by vehicles, for example. I think dark coloured outer clothing for winter use is a mistake. And, since men seem to dislike wearing light colours in outer clothing, you can always find gear like this at a discount - like I did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JP3ZSOA5MJE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VG58CC#wasThisHelpful","R1JP3ZSOA5MJE5","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not much of a stretch to suggest the gourmet label for this. This freeze dried beef stew is quite tasty; In the interest of rapidly rendering a review for Amazon shoppers on this Mountain House beef stew I removed the oxygen absorber packet, poured in two cups of boiling water, closed the package, and waited about ten minutes.That's all you have to do; boil water. The result after giving it five or ten minutes to cool is a surprisingly palatable stew. It isn't watery, but it has a sauce that adds to the eating enjoyment.The components, as is sometimes the case with freeze dried foods, are very slightly crunchy on being eaten. That's OK with me. I'd rather have that than the meal being mushy.This entire packet (I ate it all), nominally 2.5 servings, supplies about half your daily protein, about 150% of vitamin A, about 50% vitamin C, and about 500 calories. You might want to boil some rice or pasta or eat some bread with this to supply more calories in your lunch if you were active. Otherwise, eating just two of these and some Mountain House Granola breakfast would be a diet regimen.Mountain House Granola with Blueberries, Milk with Probiotics(1 pack)After you add the pint of boiling water (be careful) you need a long handled spoon to stir the mixture. A long handled titanium is one I can recommend based on my use.Vargo Titanium Long Handle SpoonOther than that there's not much more to say except that the expiration date on the package I tried was OCTOBER 2018! How's that for storage life?

"I bought two brands of these LED emergency lights after a brief power outage at my home. That, I felt, was a reminder of what can happen a couple of times a year in my community. So, I looked in Amazon for something to keep me from taking a fall or getting some other injury in the dark.Two seemed like good prospects:Hunter 45180 IllumiNite 4-LED Emergency Light - 2 PackandGreenlite NL/WH/3/1/CD/1 - LED 3-in-1 Night Light, Emergency Light, & FlashlightWith the Hunter 4 LED model, you get lots of light and not so much longevity as a nightlight unplugged or W/O power. It has a flashlight mode also. By actual torture test in my home, the Hunter lasted unplugged less than 11 hours, not the ""up to 20 hours"" on the package. I had charged it in the outlet for 24 hours. But you get two of them for the same price as the Greenlight (but only half the number of hours). The Hunter is an attractive product and should get you through a night W/O power more safely by avoiding falls, etc.The Greenlight in actual torture testing so far shows no sign of the light going out after a good 18 hours of unplugged light after 24 hours in the outlet charging. The Greenlight has only 2 LED. That's why it lasts longer. Two LED is quite enough for a nightlight. It also has a flashlight mode.So, there is a little compare and contrast on these two products I bought at Amazon. My preference based on this testing, not on the product durability over the long time, is to go for the one that last the longest even if it costs more. When you need emergency light, you need it bad and you want it available for as long as possible. Lasting a couple of nights at least. You pays your money and you takes your chances. Less isn't always more. In this case, fewer LED in the product means longer life - that's the Greenlight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XXD9GPJCOML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QDEJN6#wasThisHelpful","R32XXD9GPJCOML","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Easy enough, that's for sure. Just boil (directions say 2 cups/16oz of water, but I say 1 3/4 cups) the water, add to the package after you remove the oxygen packet, and reseal the package and wait about fifteen minutes after stirring. You might have to wait another fifteen minutes or so when you open the package since it will be way too hot to consume.The full package will give you about 32 grams of protein (about half of a man's MDR) and about 450 calories (about 25% or less of a mans MDR). It also gives you nearly 50% of your sodium MDR.Taste: well, you have to chew this well. It's not like mom used to make when she had a hand meat grinder and used fresh potatoes. There are some spices added that contribute to the generally good taste. I ate the entire package (nominally 2 servings) to try it out.It's about what I expected. Well worth the price if you want some stick-to-the-ribs food for the trail or for emergency use after storms, floods, power failure, etc. I intend to buy more to keep for emergency use.Mine came with a 12/2016 date which I assume is the expiration date suggested. So, not bad to have some food available that will store for the next four years, maybe longer. Camping is more fun if you don't have to spend too much over a hot stove.

"This meal is easy to take. That's it! In a nutshell, it gives a good caloric count, a decent amount of protein, no indigestion, sticks to your ribs so you don't feel hungry again in just a couple of hours, and doesn't weigh much or take up too much space in your backpack. As freeze dried food, they last a long time with no refrigeration required.You can easily carry enough of these, along with my favorite granola Mountain House for breakfast, for a few days.

"I prefer air mattresses or sleeping pads. Comfort is the main reason with light carrying weight a very important consideration for me when I backpack. Light and it packs small. A winning combination. Love it!Blow it up until it is rigid, stuff it under your sleeping bag in your bivvy sack (you should always have one of those - tents leak), and you will not bottom out if you are a normal weight. Just a few minutes of blowing into the metal valve at the head (unscrew first) will do it, then tighten the valve. Voilà!I suggest the long size. I am about six feet tall but was glad for the extra inches. Suggestion: get an air PILLOW too.

"I'm always looking for the perfect backpack. I have several. One I have had for about seven years was priced about half of the price for this one and it is still giving good service although some of the strap seams are finally loosening a little. The reason I like it is that it has just one large interior - lots of stuff can fit in there.This item is different. Even the large sections of the body (there are two - one has a laptop section - why don't makers have the strap that holds the lappie in place made long enough to fit over the top of a 15 inch device, huh?). But the lappie it could hold might only be a 13 inch at most if the strap were to velcro over the top of it. The other section is not very deep front to back either.The unit is not very wide - not as wide as my seven year old bag. Wide means you can carry bulkier stuff. So, this unit has limitations.The color of the BURNISH color selection is not white, not gray, it is a light green - not obvious from the photo. OK with me. I opt for visibility in a backpack. Getting run down by the hockey mom from Hell ruins my day.So, if you can deal with not having one large space in the body of the bag, you will love this. I count six accessory pouches along the sides, bottom, and top - plus there are two inside compartments with a laptop sleeve in the rearmost one. So you don't need to get frustrated trying to dig into the cavernous body of the  bag to find stuff. Just remember where you packed a certain category of gear, and you are fine - saves time.I put grooming items in one side, small tools in the other, first aid stuff in the top pouch, compact (ie, aluminized mylar) cold survival stuff in the middle pouch, and in the moderately spacious bottom I have a small poncho, rain pants, dry skivvies, and a small towel. Bivvy bag and sleeping bag and air mattress and folding fabric water bucket in the big sections. Just weighed it with all the gear I want to carry in it for light camping and it comes to just over 18 Lbs.The shoulder straps are comfortable with straps to hold them together for greater stability. The bag has no hip straps which, on a bag that is not huge, is a net plus for me since I don't like them unless they are really needed for carrying heavy loads.The Marmot Granite Backpack is well designed and manufactured in Vietnam which, in many products I have bought in the last five years or so, produces a high quality of manufacture. I think most people would find this suitable for an intermediate level of backpack use. Perhaps overkill for hauling books to class; perhaps insufficient for climbing the Alps. But handy? Yes. I think I'll like using this a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9YDME4KVFFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JYFP3S#wasThisHelpful","R3G9YDME4KVFFZ","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stayed away from Leatherman for years. The cause was a multitool years ago that had an unsteady, if that's the word, blade. And it just lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, the quality you notice instantly.Fortunately, the Style CS is a quality item with no defects that I can see. The tweezers are perfectly aligned and easy enough to pull out (mind you, strong short fingernails help with any use of this item). Got a splinter or bit of glass chip under the skin? This might help. Or handle a really tiny part (if you are into emergency watch repair, let's say). Nice feature I never had on a small tool before.The blade is where you need a strong fingernail even more than the tweezers but it is beveled on one side only and is decently sharp but it never hurts to strop it a little with emery paper or fine diamond file. As everyone knows, it's hell to open purchased items with super strong plastic container or wrapping. Slice through them in confidence with this. There are a couple of tiny holes near the back edge of the blade.The scissors are sharp enough out of the box and they have a small spring lever that keeps tension on them in rapid use. Open packages, emergency garment repair, strip insulated wire with careful use; lots of uses.The tiny flat head screwdriver/file might work on a small phillips screw as well. The file is far better than any such I've ever seen in gear like this. It could almost be a diamond surface because of its abrasive ability (but I'm sure it isn't). A nice touch.By the way, the illustration on the Amazon page is slightly smaller than the actual item. So, it's bigger than a Swiss Army small nail file and scissors device. It's just the size I wanted. I may look into the larger Leatherman tools later on.The carabiner clips to pant belt loops and opens bottles.

"Unless you have really strong fingernails, having a device like this will enable you to dig, dig, dig (just like your terrier does) whenever necessary. It doesn't take much space in your bugout bag or weigh too much but it is made of a common grade of stainless steel which should be durable enough.They get dirty in use and you don't want this item abrading your other gear so the sturdy case is a bonus.

"Preparing this chicken and mashed potato freeze-dried meal from Mountain House is a little more complicated than most of their meals that involve no more than adding boiling water, closing the package, and waiting a few minutes. My blueberries and cereal meal just needed cold milk. I've tried several of their meal packages and they are all a credit to the freeze-dried process. Very tasty and plenty of calories for the tired hiker.This meal provides a more hearty helping of protein than the other meals. But it isn't that stuffed with calories; you might want to mix up some additional potato flakes or rice or pasta to provide them. What this meal does right is provide a couple of fair sized chicken cutlets along with just enough flavored mashed potato to go along with it.After removing the oxygen reducing packet, setting aside the mashed potato flakes enclosed, you just add 1.5 cups of boiling water, wait three minutes or so, remove the chicken cutlets (pincers would be handy here), add the enclosed mashed potato flakes to the remaining water which you were careful not to lose, wait another few minutes and you have a meal you wouldn't expect to have available on the trail. Or, heck! if you can afford it, this is easier than cooking the same thing at home - student, retiree, handicapped: go for it!The chicken cutlet doesn't taste exactly as a cutlet bought at the supermarket fresh. Mom used to make a chicken frickasee where the chicken was tastier and more tender than this. But don't despair - this is a pretty good meal. Take some of this along just for your morale boosting. It's a little bit of civilization on the trail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BGQOGGJ4LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054P3GIO#wasThisHelpful","R4BGQOGGJ4LP","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second Deuter backpack. The first was the Deuter 28 which had a somewhat different design for keeping the load away from the surface of your back with mesh and spring steel panels which really work to promote less back sweat and more load carrying capacity. The Deuter is a German design (in business since the late 19th Century according to the excellent printed features guide enclosed). They are made in Vietnam to a very high standard. High quality materials and workmanship.Mine shipped from an outfitter called Moosejaw in Michigan. Got it by standard shipping near Boston in about five days, well packed. Got their last one at ninety-five dollars - good luck on beating that price!Back to Deuter: google some of their backpack model reviews and it seems everybody who writes them up likes them a lot. This is the first pack I've had with the waist buckle; it really does contribute to comfort and stability. Chest buckle included, too. Built-in pack rain cover. handy front mesh holder for jacket, helmet, etc. Loops along bottom and sides to hold skis! Mid back front quick entrance U-shaped zipper. Top main entrance has a drawstring. Weatherproof cover goes over that.Well padded back with large channels for airflow. Special foam allows airflow on the two vertical contact panels. Closed compartment on one side (left) and open mesh bottle carry area on the right. Right waist pad has a small pouch for cell or money or energy bar. Opening and hanger inside for hydration pack. Small zippered compartment on top inside for valuables. Removable pad on inside back - when not hiking, sit on it!It don't get no better than this as backpacks go.

"Your Baedeker, as in those wonderful guidebooks to Europe, for Harvard Square has arrived. It is coffee table size so there the analogy ends. But as a unique resource to this fascinating place, it has no equal. Mo Lotman loves Harvard Square. In fact, of the estimated two million visitors yearly, many must form the same attachment he did.You will find this to be a highly graphic and well organized work notwithstanding the very informative text and captions. It is arranged by time and by streets. It is populated by photos of the people who have passed through it for nearly six decades. Retail stores have come and gone. Events, sometimes violent such as the 1970 riots of Vietnam War protesters, have flared and burnt out.Do you remember the movie, The Time Machine, where the past flashed by as the time traveller went way, way back? If this book were a film, that's what it would do: illuminate a past in which many people have lit a torch. But it isn't much about celebrities, although some Hasty Pudding parades are featured. No, it's about you and me. About the acts, buskers, booksellers, con-men, design research, folk, fops, girls, guys, hotels, jazz, kitsch, menus, musicians, performers, preachers, queens, students, x-rated, youth and more.Many talented professionals, as well as myriad amateur photographers, contributed to the core attraction: the photographs. If you were here years ago, this will bring back memories. If you have never been here, when you visit you will know far more than the average tourist. Incidentally, Harvard University is not the focus, but rather incidental to the story. This is best since Harvard is a multiverse virtually incapable of being confined in a print publication. But Harvard graduates and their families will treasure the reading experience this provides.Each of us on reading it will find so much he knew and so much more he might have known but missed. It is a valuable resource for travel professionals, libraries, historians, but most of all for you and me. We were there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB58W60HPURY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584797479#wasThisHelpful","R2OB58W60HPURY","A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTZ4O5E2W4DK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Phillip Kerr's latest Bernie Gunther novel, Prague Fatale, is a very much welcome addition to the Bernie Gunther series.  For those new to the series, Bernie Gunther is a cop, a detective.  But he isn't just any detective. He's a Berliner and he has been working the streets from the days of the Weimar Republic on through to the regime of Adolf Hitler.  Like most `hard-boiled' detectives, Gunther likes to toe his own line and has a fierce independent streak.  Of course independence is not a prized attribute in Nazi Germany if you want to make it until your next birthday.  As a result, he has made his own comprises, compromises that render him at time close to suicidally depressed.  But he carries on.Prague Fatale is mostly set, no surprise, in Prague.  Gunther has been called to Prague by none other then Reinhard Heydrich, one of the architects of the Holocaust, serving in Prague as the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.  He was a butcher to be sure but, unlike the Eichmanns of the regime who may rightfully fall under Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"" umbrella, Heydrich was in many respects cultured and sophisticated.  Heydrich, getting ready to celebrate his arrival in Prague commands Gunther, who he has run into in previous books in the series, to serve as a bodyguard and general house detective.  No sooner does Gunther arrive than the murder of a high-ranking adjutant takes place.  It is an old-fashioned locked-door scenario.  The book follows Gunther as he walks through the maze of intrigue and deceit surrounding the murder.Although the book is very well-plotted and suspenseful, I think Kerr exceeds in the characterization of Gunther and the players in these dramas.  Kerr acknowledges Gunther's complicity in the system but manages to leave the reader with no small amount of sympathy for the choices Gunther has had to make.  Clearly one could argue that Gunther suffers from the guilt of surviving and Kerr makes good use of it.Prague Fatale was one of the more enjoyable books in the series.  I think it stands up on its own, but I think the new reader will be well-served by picking up some of the earlier books in the series first.  Either way, I can only say: highly recommended.L.

"I was very much looking forward to Herge, Son of Tintin.  I was a Tintin fan growing up and thought this could really help flesh out the back-story of the man who created such a delightful cast of characters.Althought I enjoyed the book, I have to say that that it did not (and probably could not) live up to my expectations.  Unlike Tintin and his 'gang' there was no enchantment in the book.  What I found was an informative, detailed, straight-line narrative of Herge's life.There was nothing wrong with the narrative, and given the fact that Herge lived a pretty interesting life, the book was worth reading.  I enjoyed the narrative that described the evolution of Tintin: Herge's creative thinking and art work really did transform how people viewed 'comics' (for lack of a better word).  I found the description of Herge's action during the German occuptaion to be the highlight of the book.  Herge, and many of his friends, made some choices that put him in some water after the war and Peeters is pretty even-handed in his treatment of Herge.All-in-all I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the man behind Tintin.  This book won't set the world on fire and the reader will not go on the type of wild ride that he/she may enjoy while reading a Tintin story, but Herge's 'back-story' is interesting, if told in a dry fashion, and will put much of Tintin's adventures into a fuller context.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBP97L8T8HD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421404540#wasThisHelpful","R1XBP97L8T8HD5","A28PRU8FTMCT8J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28PRU8FTMCT8J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his heyday the former Premier of France bestrode France and Europe like a colossus.  A larger than-life figure he was at once feared, respected, admired, and often hated.  It seemed that whenever the French Republic had a crisis, be it monetary, labor, social strife, or war the President of France would call on him to save the republic one more time.  Now, at age 82 he is sick and living in relative seclusion in a house off the Normandy coast. He is watched over by a personal secretary, a cook, physician and chauffer.  His days are spent in isolation and he spends much of his waking hours quietly contemplating his life.  His stillness is that of the aging lion. He sits in his study and barely moves, as if conserving what little energy and time he has left.  As the story opens France is facing yet another crisis.  The government has fallen and the President is seeking desperately to find a Premier to step in to save France one more time.  As the country's eyes turn to the most likely prospect, Chalmont, the retired Premier asks himself whether he should go public with the damaging information that he has about the man who was once his most trusted assistant.Loosely based on the latter years of Georges Clemenceau (""Le Tigre"") George Simenon's ""The President"" is one more reason why I will pick up and read a book by Simenon anywhere I can find it.  Perhaps best known for his Inspector Maigret stories such as The Hotel Majestic (Penguin Mysteries), I think his finest work can be found in what he called his ""romans durs"" or hard stories such as The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics).  These were not police procedurals but, rather, stories that looked at the dark side of our nature.  The Simenons I have read have all been fine examples of the art of writing and ""The President"" is no exception.  Simenon takes the reader into the mind of this aging leader as he contemplates the world around him, from the political crisis to the randy behavior of his young kitchen girl, you get lost in his own thoughts and musings.  The premiere's decision as to whether to pull the rug from under Chalmont's pending ascension to power is handled with skill.If you already know and admire Simenon this book should be added to you collection.  If you have not read Simenon yet this is as good a place to start as any.  Highly recommended.  L.

"Kostya is a young Russian whose face was burned recognition while serving with the Russian army in its ongoing campaign against the Chechnya insurgents.  As Andrei Gelasimov's ""Thirst"" opens, Kostya is back at home he sits in his apartment, sometimes for weeks at a time, drinking vodka. It seems the only time he leaves his apartment in when his downstairs neighbor asks him to come to her apartment to scare her young child into behaving, doing his homework or going to bed.  Kostya's life is as void of form as his face.  Then, without much notice, Kostya's army buddies, other survivors of the attack that left Kostya scarred, arrive to tell them they are going on a road trip: to find out what happened to another buddy who has gone missing.More a novella than a novel, ""Thirst"" takes us on the road trip.  Narrated by Kostya we get a glimpse of Kostya's life before and after the attack.  Although something of a road trip story this is really the story of Kostya's life.  As he embarks on his journey the reader embarks on a journey that takes us into Kostya's early life and mostly dysfunctional family relationships, the attack that left Kostya scarred and drowning in vodka.""Thirst"" is not a groundbreaking story. It is very well written and the translation does seem to highlight the staccato-tempo of Kostya's journey. I did like how Gelasimov ended the story. It seemed fitting and realistic. I would recommend reading ""Thirst"" even if I won't suggest dropping everything on your to-be-read pile to run out and start this.  It is, however, worth reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZB82SAAAOS7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090695#wasThisHelpful","R2ZB82SAAAOS7P","A28PRU8FTMCT8J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28PRU8FTMCT8J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So sang Dinah Washington.  And much like Dinah Washington, Walter Mosley's ""All I Did Was Shoot my Man"" is filled with the blues, the type of blues that makes for a great story.Leonid McGill, who made his first appearance in The Long Fall, isn't as much a private eye as he is a `fixer'.  Named after Leonid Breshnev by his long-absent revolutionary Marxist father, McGill's career involves taking other people's problems and finding a way out.  Leonid's problem, and one that he is painfully aware of, is that the people whose problems he fixes are generally pretty unsavory and the fixes often have had the sometimes intentional, sometimes unintentional effect of getting innocent people drawn into messes that are not of their own making.  Generally, this would not make Leonid an appealing character to wrap a series of stories around.  However, in the hands of Mosley, McGill is drawn as one of those irresistible characters that draw you in and, against your better judgment, make you want to root for him to succeed.  Leonid's saving grace is his painful self-awareness. He knows how flawed he is. In fact he is tormented by his past. His self-awareness and his strength in trying to steer a new course make him all the more human and it was impossible not to pull for him as the story progressed.As noted, there's a lot of blues in this story. Leonid's wife Katrina is going off the deep end for reasons set out in the story.  His eldest son, who he knows is not really his, is moving in with his Russian girl-friend, a woman with a checkered past that would make the Mayflower Madam blush.  And, at the center of the story is one Zella Grisham.  Recently released from prison for shooting her boyfriend after finding him in a `delicate' situation with her girlfriend, she is also the victim of one of Leonid's fixes.  Leonid's job is to find some way to assist Zella, and find some redemption in doing so.  The story line is complicated but involves the theft of $58 million dollars from an insurance company's vault in lower Manhattan.As the story plays out we see the threads of each separate story line blend together.  I won't speak of the plot as it is impossible to do so without spoilers.  Let's just say that the story line is well plotted, well-paced, and sufficiently entertaining that it kept me up late as I decided to read `just one more chapter' and then another and then another before calling it a night.The highlight of the story for me, though, was not the plotting but the characterization. I think Mosley has always had a fine eye for character development. His major characters such as Easy Rawlins, Fearless Jones, Socrates Fortlow and, now, Leonid McGill all seem fully realized. They are not heroes on white horses to save the day but real flesh and blood characters with all their flaws and painful back stories.  His minor characters are similarly drawn and remind me, in this instance, of the type of New York characters set out by Damon Runyon, but with a harder New York edge.I very much liked ""All I did Was Shoot My Man"" and have no hesitation about recommending to anyone who likes a hard-boiled story with some pretty well thought out characters.

"for nine filterless Camels and eight red-tipped matches.""Walter Mosley's newest novel, ""The Long Fall"", is full of this sort of short, terse nuggets that should assure any fan that while Easy Rawlins may be gone, Leonid McGill will fill that void very nicely.Set in New York City, Leonid McGill is not as much a P.I. as he is an old-school fixer.  You have a problem; Leonid's your go-to guy.  The problem is that Leonid's client base has been historically filled with unsavory characters and the fixes made by Leonid have had some tragic consequences.  Leonid is a man quite capable of self-reflection and he is haunted by his past.  As a result, as the story opens, he has tried to walk away from that part of his work and decided to concentrate on cases that do not torture his newly invigorated sense of right and wrong.  But, to paraphrase the only memorable line from the turgid Godfather 3 ""just when he thought he was out... they pull him back in.""  The result is an excellent, fast-paced story.There are three parallel plot lines in ""The Long Fall"".  Leonid, named by his radical union-organizing father after Leonid Brezhnev), is asked by a shady P.I. from Albany to identify four men whose only connection is a decades old tragic event from their teenage years.  As soon as their identities are revealed they start to die.  At the same time, Leonid's step-son seems to have gotten himself mixed up in some bad business and Leonid tries to help his son out before the young teen digs himself a hole he can't crawl out of. Last, one of Leonid's former mob connections tries to get Leonid to locate a former mob-accountant. Leonid knows that finding this man will lead to his death.  The story tracks each plot line until each one find some sort of resolution.Two things stand out about ""The Long Fall"".  First is the character of Leonid McGill.  He's not a hero on a white horse. He's a flawed man, and some may say he's a bad man living in a bad world.  But his saving grace is Leonid's self-awareness. He knows how flawed he is. In fact he is tormented by his past. His self-awareness and his strength in trying to steer a new course make him all the more human and it was impossible not to pull for him as the story progressed. Second is the quality of Mosley's writing.  Since the genre came of age I think it fair to say that Chandler and Hammett are without peers.  I'd put those two in a class by themselves.  But Mosley has a terrific way with words and has the hard, sparse style that I've come to associate with the best `noir' writing.  So while Mosley may not be Chandler or Hammett (who is?) I think he is one of the very few writers today who can be mentioned with them in the same sentence without embarrassment.""The Long Fall"" is an excellent piece of writing and will be enjoyed by fans of Mosley or for anyone looking for the next terrific `hard-boiled detective'.

"In stray gifts to be claimed by whoever shall find.""The opening line of William Wordsworth's ""Stray Pleasures"" captures accurately Patrick Leigh Fermor's ""A Time of Gifts"". Fermor's story of his walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople is filled with tales of the stray gifts he found along the way. Fermor's story, one that was an absolute treat to come upon and read, was a gift to this reader.Fermor was a child of what could be called the British colonial diaspora. Born in London in 1915, Fermor's mother left Patrick in England while she went to join her husband, a geologist, in India. Patrick was left to board with another family and, when old enough, was packed off to a series of boarding schools. Perhaps not surprisingly, Fermor's childhood was marked by a series of schoolboy rebellions and just shy of his 18th birthday found himself expelled from his school. With nothing much to do he decided to take a ferry from England to the Hook of Holland and from there to proceed on foot across Europe until he reached Constantinople. He left England in December 1933.""A Time of Gifts"" covers Fermor's travels from England to the Danube River. Partly a recreation from the journals he kept during his walk (his earlier journals were lost early on in his trip) and from memory when he set down to write of his travels in the 1970s, ""A Time of Gifts"" is a remarkable piece of writing. As the reader walks along with Fermor he/she is treated not just to description of Europe as seen from ground-level but of a Europe and its people that would soon be transfigured in another world war. This is a study in time and of place and is captured in prose that captured me from the start.It is hard in a brief review to capture the flavor of Fermor's writings but I am hopeful one example will entice the prospective readers. After finding an Inn in a town busy celebrating Hitler's ascension to the Chancellery of the Germany, Fermor is touched and transformed by the folk music he heard sung in that tavern:--Later on the volume dwindled and the thumping died away as the singing became softer and harmonies and descants began to weave more complex patterns. Germany has a rich anthology of regional songs, and these, I think were dreamy celebrations of the forests and plains of Westphalia, long sighs of homesickness musically transposed. It was charming. And the charm made it impossible, at the moment, to connect the singers with organized bullying and the smashing of Jewish shop windows and nocturnal bonfires of books.--Fermor's journey is filled with interesting detours and diversions and those just added to the pleasure. He seemed to have a gift for languages (as his later career as an undercover operative during WWII evidences), a gift for people as he managed to always find some way to befriend and be befriended by people he met along the way, and a gift for telling a story. ""A Time of Gifts"" is an apt title indeed.L.

"In any rational list of the 20th-century's top song-stylists, Ella Fitzgerald would have to rank in the Top 5. Ella had a wonderful, distinct voice and style. Many singers have great skills. Many have perfect pitch and great intonation. But very few singers can use their voice like a fine instrument. Ella was one of those select few.Apart from having a wonderful voice, Ella was next to incomparable when it came to interpreting lyrics. It is no wonder that lyricists loved her and were ecstatic when she covered one of their songs. It is also no wonder that during the course of her career Ella recorded various ""Song Books"" in which she took the work of a great composer/lyricist and dedicated an album or two to their work. Ella did Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, Rodgers & Hart, the Gershwins', and Jerome Kern song books among others. They are all wonderful to listen to, all 5-star performances (with the possible exception of the Gershwin song book) but my favorite of all her song books is this one: ""Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book"".Although the first half of the 20th century had a surplus of great songwriters (see the above) there was something about Cole Porter's work that has kept his lyrics fresh and even edgy in the 21st-century. The pairing of Fitzgerald and Porter then is the equivalent of the perfect storm: A lyricist whose lyrics are funny, witty, charming and, yes, poetic; and a singer capable of doing justice to those great lyrics makes for a memorable CD.This is a 2-CD set. It contains an awful lot of Porter's great songs. Anything Goes, Too Darn Hot, Let's Do it, and I'm Always True to You in My Fashion are my highlights for CD-1. Night and Day, I've Got You Under My Skin, Love for Sale, and You're the Top, top off CD-2. Ella recorded these in 1956 under the auspices of the wonderful producer Norman Granz. Verve Records has restored the masters and the sound quality is excellent for a re-mastered recording.Cole Porter once said that ""In olden days a glimpse of stockings, was looked on as something shocking, Now heaven knows, anything goes."" Well, all these decades later these songs go great with anything. You can enjoy them ""in the still of the night"" or ""all through the night"". These songs ""do something to me"" and I can say nothing more than this CD is the tops, it's the Tower of Pisa, it's the smile on the Mona Lisa.If you can find this available, do yourself a favor and buy it, then sit back and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TC4ASYNMFH97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034JKYZK#wasThisHelpful","R2TC4ASYNMFH97","A28PRU8FTMCT8J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28PRU8FTMCT8J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I walk mid shamble smear and stench, The dead I mourn."" John Finley.The Soviet journalist and author Vasily Grossman did more than kneel behind the soldier's trench. He lived with the Red Army from the catastrophic summer of 1941, through the defense of Moscow, the apocalyptic carnage of Stalingrad, the hard-won liberation of Soviet territory, the horrible discoveries of Nazi genocide in Madjanek and Treblinka, and the final bloody, triumphant march into Berlin. Anthony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova's ""A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army 1941-1945"" is a marvelous examination of both ""Grossman's war"" and the war itself.Vasily Grossman is something of a forgotten, unsung giant of Soviet literature. Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Although never a member of the Communist Party, Grossman was, for most of his life, a strong supporter of the Soviet Union. Grossman's reporting was realistic (despite editing by Party censors) and was enormously popular among both high ranking officers and foot soldiers. After the war, Grossman returned to writing. His magnum opus, Life and Fate was not published in the USSR until 1988. When it was originally submitted for publication the Soviet authorities `arrested' the book and told Grossman that it would not be published for 200 years. Fortunately, a copy of the manuscript survived, was smuggled to Switzerland and published in Europe in 1980, fifteen years after Grossman's death. Life and Fate was based, in good part, on Grossman's wartime experiences. Consequently, Beevor's work provides both an historical, ground-level examination of the war generally and a great deal of insight into the life experiences that formed the moral foundation of Grossman's novels.Beevor (and his translator and collaborator Vinogradova) have taken Grossman's notebooks, war diaries, personal correspondence and his Red Star articles and set them out as part of their narrative. The transition from Grossman's text to the commentary is well thought out and seamless. Beevor is no stranger to the Eastern Front, (he has written two well received books""Stalingrad"" and ""The Fall of Berlin"") and he does an excellent job of putting Grossman's writings into the context of his times.Grossman is swept into the war as a reporter for Red Star immediately after the German invasion in June, 1941. Grossman's writing (and Beevor's commentary) takes us through that first disastrous summer of defeat, despair, death, and retreat. The magnificent and bloody defense of Stalingrad follows and the success of Operation Uranus in November, 1942 that resulted in the encirclement and destruction of General Paulus' Sixth Army follows. The next portion of the book has Grossman writing about the Red Army on the offensive, from the Battle of Kursk through the liberation of the Ukraine and then Poland. It is here that Grossman first learns of the horror that was the holocaust.Grossman's reports from Treblinka were the first, first-hand accounts of the Nazi death camps and what Grossman saw changed his life. Although Jewish, Grossman had always considered himself a secular citizen of the USSR. The death camps and the murder of his mother at the hands of Nazis and Ukrainian collaborators reawakened his sense of a Jewish identity even though he remained totally secular. Grossman's experience of the camps and the evidence he saw there of man's innate inhumanity to man stunned him even after almost 4 years of living with brutality on an unfathomable scale. In ending one of his reports Grossman writes: ""It is infinitely hard even to read this. The reader must believe me, it is as hard to write it. Someone might ask: ""Why write about all this, why remember all that?"" It is the writer's duty to tell this terrible truth, and it is the civilian duty of the reader to learn it.""It is clear from reading A Writer at War and two of Grossman's novels, Life and Fate (New York Review Books Classics) and Everything Flows (New York Review Books Classics) that Grossman took his duty to tell his terrible truth seriously. Beevor has done Grossman a good service by letting Grossman's voice be heard again. I hope this book creates renewed interest in Grossman's life and writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUW91N38CME1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NX6Y24#wasThisHelpful","RYUW91N38CME1","A28PRU8FTMCT8J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28PRU8FTMCT8J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. Luke 6:19There is a tendency in the U.S. today that when we think of William Jennings Bryan, if we think about him at all, we think of the aging demagogue defending Creationism at the ""Scopes Monkey Trial"". Bryan's image seems coextensive with the actor Frederic March's characterization of a preening, self-righteous zealot in the movie ""Inherit the Wind"". Michael Kazin's ""A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan"" does a wonderful job of capturing the political life of a man who captured the ears and hearts of millions of Americans from 1896 until his death in 1925 at the age of 65. Millions of American farmers and laborers saw virtue in Bryan and sought to touch him. Kazin goes a long way towards explaining the social and political phenomenon that was William Jennings Bryan.Kazin's ""A Godly Hero"" is both well-written and meticulously researched. Bryan, known to friends and foes alike as the ""Great Commoner"" was the Democratic Party's candidate for President in 1896, 1900, and 1908. Kazin does an excellent job of presenting Bryan as more than a cartoon-like caricature. Although always a devout, fervent Christian Bryan rose to national acclaim not on the basis of his religious world view but on a populist platform that was more than a bit radical for his time. Kazin points out, of course, that Bryan's political views were informed by his Christian beliefs, but notes that those beliefs led him to fight as a populist for social justice. Bryan's three presidential campaigns called for support for the rights of small farmers and factory workers as they did battle against the big railroads and factory owners. He sought to nationalize the railroads, legalize the right to strike, and to be among the earliest campaigners for women's suffrage. Those beliefs led him to strike out against the incipient imperialism of the United States as it launched its first overseas military adventures in Cuba and the Philippines. Bryan's religious beliefs may also be linked to the antiwar stance he took as Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State in 1913-1914. He opposed the government's perceived movement towards war even as it stressed its ongoing neutrality.Kazin takes pains to point out that Bryan's stern religious beliefs placed him on the side of social progress and not on the side of reaction. This is an important consideration in any historical examination undertaken in an era when strong religious convictions are often invariably linked (and often unfairly) to social and political conservatism. Kazin does an excellent job of putting Bryan's religious beliefs into the context of an era in which the progressive and populist movements grew throughout the country's urban areas and farm lands.Bryan's meteoric rise to fame was facilitated in no small part by his oratorical skills. Both supporters and foes marveled at Bryan's ability to keep a crowd transfixed during his speeches. Kazin's description of Bryan's stunning Cross of Gold speech at the 1896 Democratic Convention brings that convention to life.This is not a warts-free biography. Kazin notes the inherent conflict between Bryan's egalitarian instincts and his kow-towing to his southern Democratic supporters who spent most of the years from 1896-1908 disenfranchising (and lynching when necessary) black American voters in the south. This ""Great Commoner"" chafed at U.S. policies denying the Philippines the right of self determination while condoning the segregationist policies of the Wilson administration that resulted in eliminating blacks from all but menial federal jobs. It is here, on the great American altar of race relations that Kazin's resurrection of Bryan becomes a bit problematic. It is clear that Bryan's populist beliefs were sincere and from the heart. However, it is far from clear whether Bryan's acquiescence to the forces of racism in his party was based on a fundamental belief in the inferiority of another race or a necessary political accommodation to a powerful element of his popular base. If the former is the case one must question Bryan's judgment. If the latter is the case one must question whether this accommodation with the evil that was Jim Crow ruins his reputation for integrity.""A Godly Hero"" closes with Bryan's last moments in the public eye, at the trial of John Scopes. Called to the witness stand by famous defense attorney Clarence Darrow (who once called Bryan the ""idol of morondom""), Bryan was eviscerated by a series of questions about a literal interpretation of the book of Genesis. It is interesting to note that Bryan managed to avoid answering Darrow's questions directly. It seems (to me at least) that Bryan was not prepared to testify under oath than Jonah was swallowed by a while and other similar questions. This does tend to support Kazin's thesis that Bryan was not as much concerned with the teaching of evolution as with the growing line of thought by `social Darwinists' who used Darwin's teachings to espouse wars of conquest and the physical elimination of the weak by the strong.Taken as a whole, Bryan's life is a study in contradictions. He fought for social justice while accommodating segregation. He fought for women's suffrage at the same time he led the fight for prohibition. He campaigned unsuccessfully on platforms (workers' rights and federal insurance for bank deposits for example) that helped elect liberal Democrats from FDR through LBJ but will go down in history for his assault on the teaching of evolution. Michael Kazin's ""A Godly Hero"" does an excellent job of sorting through these contradictions and giving us a picture of Bryan as a ""man-in-full"". ""A Godly Hero"" is a worthy addition to the history of the populist era.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCXF6IT54SAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035Q4AR0#wasThisHelpful","R1HCXF6IT54SAJ","A28PRU8FTMCT8J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28PRU8FTMCT8J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never been to Detroit but its rise and fall fortunes through the decades is fascinating. Of course, so much of the history is tied to the automobile industry and though the author attempts to balance this fact, it easily overwhelms. The content was sound but quite dry as if we are reading city council transcripts or aggregated news stories. What is missing entirely are real human narratives. Still, bits were intriguing. While Ford and others produced cars I had not thought that the automobile industry would not have been a success without innovation in street paving. As well, the current solution for the city is mind boggling. It calls for concentrating its citizens while knocking down whole derelict neighbourhoods and returning them to nature.

"This was my first book on the Leopold and Loeb case having been overly influenced by Hitchcock's Rope. It straightened out misperceptions and illuminated whole new areas. What first struck me was just how young the two were and just how warped their relationship. The crime itself also shocks given how cold and horrific the act. Baatz lets all of this out in a detailed historic narrative.I was struck by the media and celebrity aspects that foreshadows our own times. The lawyers and accused's every word ran on the front pages and captured the interest of America. There are parallels to Columbine, OJ, and too many others. Yet, it is here that the book bogs down a bit. Baatz spends a great deal of time covering Darrow and Crowe. He builds the book around their respective personalities and courtroom strategies. This approach succeeds only in taking the spotlight off the accused and completely losing the victims in the process.The case is constantly referenced in popular culture but mostly inaccurately. I, like most others, did not know Leopold and Loeb's ultimate fate.

"Author Katz has written a fine book. Well researched, reasoned, and told. Unfortunately, no one will pay heed. History not only repeats it shows a direct and line between cause and effect. In the case of every financial crisis it comes down to debt. Katz's history lesson begins in FDR's administration when debt, specifically, housing debt went mainstream and socially acceptable.Credit and debt arguably propelled us forward but imagine if you were only allowed to buy what you could afford. Would the richest class be even less than 1% and would life today be more like 1935 or 2015? I know, I am getting a ""little out there"" but it is worthy of exploration. This book was written shortly after our latest financial crisis and the dust had not yet really cleared. All we know is a bunch of instruments in the form of securitization of really bad debt will not pay.The book looks at the human cost of such actions which tries to make it personal but the macro and micro never really meet. I credit Katz with attempting to warn us of future calamity but human nature abhors a vacuum and that vacuum is made of up conflicting wants and needs, risks and rewards, foibles and facts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWYSG9HEL4YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WOD93C#wasThisHelpful","ROWYSG9HEL4YG","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise, pace and execution in the first half of the novel deserves a five star rating. The intrigue and action kicks off right away and really takes hold. Two Brit pilots find themselves down behind enemy lines during WW2. While evading their pursuers they make it onto an SS hospital train where they assume the role of wounded officers. Eventually they end up in a psychiatric clinic...how this works with the language and other issues is inventively thought out. And their stay there is harrowing for many reasons. It was positively gripping.The latter half of the novel moves us forward in time to the early 1970's. This covers the fate of many from the clinic. Unfortunately, it went on too long and was overly treated. It felt somehow defensive and aspired to be more complex than it needed to be. The resolution works but your patience will be tested to reach it. This is why the three star rarting. The novel had its impact though, I still think about the equal amounts of bravery and fear needed to pull off the initial deception in order to survive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPJVF4ZNEBQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9AXWKK#wasThisHelpful","R2CPJVF4ZNEBQ4","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bernie Gunther leads one interesting life. In this tenth book in the series, author Kerr once again places Bernie in incredible circumstances within real historical events. This plot involves Goebbels, Yugoslavia, the Swiss, and a beautiful movie actress. If that seems original, it is not in 'Philip Kerr' terms. He has created a formula for the series. Goebbels is used much like Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler have been in the past novels. Bernie often gets flung to weird geographies to investigate both civilian and military crimes. The scenes in Yugoslavia employed in The Lady from Zagreb are vivid and disturbing (a foreshadowing of that country's disintegration decades later). The Swiss provide enigmatic twists and Bernie's love interest, well, is a love interest.One aspect is growing tiresome and that is Bernie's constant morose, tired explanation of how much he loathes the Nazis. Yet, he continues to work for them, aiding and abetting their doctrine and actions. His Berlin humour and cop demeanour only gets him so far. Kerr does explore moral issues and the evil of man but there must be a reckoning at some point. The series has not been chronological. Earlier novels explored post-war Bernie but it will be fascinating to see how Kerr eventually winds up the man's life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW8GV7NBUSCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167641#wasThisHelpful","RIW8GV7NBUSCV","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this in paperback when it first came out. My memory of that turn through the pages was favourable. In this second pass, it did not hold up as well. Since the original publication there have been an overwhelming number of post-apocalyptic and dystopian novels written. What first appealed in The Culled was the premise even if the execution was rough and a little off-putting. This time the cults and factions in a much changed world came across as absurd rather than threatening. Readers should know that this became a series so may choose to tough it out to see if it improves.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19AJZ18ZZIZO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U7FCSY#wasThisHelpful","R19AJZ18ZZIZO2","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young adult time travel novel you say. No doubt it will be simplistic even juvenile. It is bound to tread familiar ground. These statements could not be farther from the truth. In fact, the only clue to this being written for a younger audience is the complete lack of expletives. I actually found this refreshing and not for prudish reasons but for the author's need to be more selective in word choice.So many aspects of this book work. The plotting is fresh, intriguing and entertaining throughout. There are layers of decent complexity and surprises that run to the very last page. We follow teenager Jack Lund back in time. Jack is on a mission to right a horrible wrong. There is such grit behind this premise that, once again, the YA classification does not seem accurate. I must admit that I rushed the book. It felt as if I was flipping pages like I did in my youth when when a new comic arrived on the stands. Hautman gives the reader, regardless of age, credit for their intellect. This was fun, fast and entertaining. I look forward to rereading it in time. By the way, after finishing it I read more about the author and love his quirky biographies on Amazon and his website.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJXWCH4DF8F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XGIC54#wasThisHelpful","R1QJXWCH4DF8F0","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fellow reviewers have pointed out that Valhalla reads like a Clive Cussler novel. It also reminded me of Matthew Reilly adventures. It is unquestionably formula but well done formula. All of the required components are present:- an ancient artifact that could change the world- an evil man with means- a highly capable military man- the love interest who is often a scientist- globe trotting locales- plenty of gunfire- a race against timeYou get the idea. It is also helpful to throw in some references to the Nazis and feature special forces units. Valhalla treads familiar ground but does it in a capable, entertaining and pleasing way. It is a fun escape best suited for a rainy afternoon or as an airplane read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G45FAQFOLZCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEF6BS#wasThisHelpful","R3G45FAQFOLZCY","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"J.L. Bourne is to blame. He is a major contributor to the explosion of all things zombie this past decade. His series of Day by Day novels follows a military man in a much changed world. The proliferation of similar plots and situations has been staggering since he reinvigorated the 'last man on earth' premise. Now we have the Arisen series by Glynn James and Michael Stephen Fuchs, The Remaining series by D.J. Molles and many, many more.So it was with some hesitation that I invested time in Lundy's series. After all, how new and fresh could it be? The genre is now largely a furious plagiarism of the same characters and stories. This thesis held true once I had read the exploits of cut-off military personnel in Afghanistan. They are truly caught behind enemy lines. So it is really nothing new and no more than serviceable in style, substance and plot. However, my big learning is that I love the premise so will forgive the repetition and so-so quality. In this regard, I am a pliable sucker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZPL6AUK3OQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPT0H9I#wasThisHelpful","R2CZPL6AUK3OQL","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is definitely curious value in this thriller. As it was published pre 911, in early 2001, the disgruntled militia-type villains seem almost quaint now. It is fascinating to read about such nostalgic threats. The author also keeps the plot going...and going. Just when you think (or hope) it's over, it finds another incredulous thread to pull. These include the most laborious inter-agency wrangling between the FBI, CIA and ATF. Then there is vague back story that prompts a CIA assassin to romp around. A tightening up by a rigorous editor would have been great.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4BRYZZRXHRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003G83UKK#wasThisHelpful","R3A4BRYZZRXHRS","A3BVQHM1C6B9UW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVQHM1C6B9UW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely an interesting premise for an anthology. The editors and contributors cover the centuries with various tales of military horror. Like most collections there is a range of quality but still overall value. Out of the sixteen, I enjoyed:- Blackwater that conjured up creepy sea creatures (not the private military contractor)- Maberry contributes a Joe Ledger story that is one of the best written and paced- Special Operations Interview was creative and the setting on a Pacific island during WW2 compelling- Making Waves also takes place during WW2 but in an interesting alternative reality where magic and sorcery are weapons- A Tide Of Flesh has the Brits fighting zombies (of all kinds) in India- Snipers save the day in Afghanistan against zombie-vampires in Death at 900 Meters- Eric S. Brown pits reservists against rampaging Bigfoots in Hold the Line- an Austrian tank crew barely escapes a long buried terror during the invasion of The Soviet Union in The ShrineMilitary and horror make for a solid mashup.

"The novel is cool that is undeniable. It is set in a coming New York that reels from terrorism. The resilient and the designer-drugged have stayed on. It features an anti-hero who dispatches folks for a fee and with a box cutter (a bit of a curious terrorist link right there). The characters are post-apocalyptic noir and their language is clipped, staccato-like as some sort of ode to texting and tweeting.I loved the first third. It was incredibly paced and highly compelling. I resigned myself to buying the next in the series. That is until I read the rest. What began so well become repetitive and ho-hum. In other words the sets and the costumes could not save the play. The drug angle was all too familiar and none of the characters including the main elicited much empathy or sustained interest. Yet, I must conclude it was still cool and perhaps the second will be all the cooler.

"It took me a few months to summon the courage to buy and read Dead Bait. Outside of a tiny bit of claustrophobia, my biggest fear are creatures below the surface. I blame my brother for taking me to see Jaws when I was ten. The book is a scary guilty pleasure that is uneven but in a good way like the Creepy and Eerie comic books from days gone by. In fact, this would have made a great graphic short story collection.The standouts for me were: Chum Bucket as it featured a leviathan and those always 'get me'; The Test Drive had a Stephen King vibe and surprise; and Lobster Stew that was by far the best written and imagined.

"This is a book rich in the detail of youth, innocence, fun and the love of family.  An adventurous girl and her younger brother find a suitcase, and decide to use a part of their summer vacation on the farm in Canada where they live to find out where it came from.  The mystery itself is delicious, satisfying and unexpected.  The journey along the way took me back, in a powerful way, to the days of my own youth in the 50s and 60s when we played outside with our brothers and sisters all day as long as there was sunlight.  The children are real: smart and full of energy, but not clever in an unbelievable way as I sometimes see in other books for young readers.  Their days on the farm include wandering through the fields, family suppers, the presence of farm machinery, visits to town and the local library, swims in the dugout and trips to other landmarks familiar to anyone who grew up on a farm.  Norma Jean and her brother Howard often have to complete daily chores before play, and a watch dog is their frequent companion.  It was a joy to spend time with Norma Jean and her extended family, which included grandparents and an uncle.  Their Dutch heritage is also an interesting aspect of the story.This was so much a visit to my own days of innocence--even though different in many of the details--that I didn't want it to end.  It was sweet and funny, poignant and full of family love as it was back then. I became immersed in the mystery and wanted to see how it would end. If you grew up then, take a visit back.  If you're younger, take a trip through time to see what it was like.  It's a very good story for children of any age, and adults will find the writing refreshing, assured and full of love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8YAM9OYHY5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FM4FNUG#wasThisHelpful","RP8YAM9OYHY5T","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to think about heaven and wonder what it will be like, so I was attracted to this book.First of all, there is a problem with the Kindle edition, which seems to affect the first chapter only.  In the first chapter there are some embedded fonts.  At the very beginning the font is very black and rather big, and you can't adjust it, then, at location 40, it switches into something that looks very much like a typewriter font.  But by the second chapter, you can fix this by going to the TOC and then choosing Chapter 2.  Then it becomes customizable.As to the content of the book, it was very sweet.  There are many lovely anecdotes of common people that he uses to help us understand his points.  However, I didn't really learn anything new.  If you know the Bible reasonably well, you already know that heaven is a place, people you know will be there, we'll have bodies, there is a book with your name on it, etc. Is there an actual book?  D.L. Moody says there is. He is very literal.  But I have to say, he does make those things seem wondrous.  You can feel the heat in his passion.  At the end of many sections, he ends with poetry, or lyrics to hymns that are simple and rhyming.All of his arguments are based on scripture, and in most cases, he gives you the verses.  He does little if any extrapolating, although he does say that we are with Christ the moment we die, and are not unconscious waiting until the end of the age, as some believe.Remember, this book is old.  Victoria was still Queen, as he mentions. But really, that's a part of its charm!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWTS740QEURF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PPCTZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1SWTS740QEURF","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be careful!  Many of the reviews of this book contain spoilers.  This review doesn't.This book I would call an amusing trifle.  I downloaded it from the Project Gutenberg website and I found few errors apart from occasional blocks of space in the middle of a chapter.  The story moves at a fast clip. There is a lot of ""woe is me"" from one character that gets a little much, but in the middle of the book there is a plot twist that creates a great deal of suspense.  It was a fun ride, a good beach read.  I read a lot of Victorian literature, including Dickens and Wilkie Collins, George Eliot, and others, and while this is not even close to that level of writing, it's still a good, light distraction.It contains some author intrusion in the form of moralizing, but that is typical of the time, and I didn't mind.  The story revolves around a young woman whose father dies, leaving her penniless.  An earnest young man offers for her and she marries him.  It could have turned out well, but then temptation arises in the form of a handsome rascal.  After that are many twists and turns.

"I've read three of the Jack Reacher books and I thought I'd write a review for those who are new to the series.Is Jack Reacher a man you can root for or is he a cold blooded killer?  Is there a lot of graphic sex and gratuitous violence?Jack Reacher is a tough guy and a little bit of a loner and a drifter.  But he doesn't have an attitude and he is capable of having feelings and relationships.  So he's not a cartoon or a stereotype--he's fully fleshed out, a ""real"" person.  I do like him.  He does a lot of violent things, but he has a moral code.  His moral code is that he stands up for the good people and the bad people are disposable.  And there are some really, really bad people in the Jack Reacher novels.  The situations can be quite disturbing if you're sensitive to that kind of thing.  However, I find it is pretty easy to skip over the violent parts without losing the thread of the story.There is usually a romance that heightens the stakes, and the stakes are always very high, creating a lot of suspense.  But the suspense isn't unrelenting.  There are areas where Reacher has to do research and interview people, and there are conversations and ruminations.  The romances are sweet and sexy, and there is nothing graphic, gross or crude.  The bad guys sometimes act out sexually, and those scenes are disturbing without being crude. I skipped over them.As for language, I really don't remember there being much.  As tough as Jack Reacher is, and as evil as his opponents are, Lee Child somehow gets by creating realistically violent and even evil situations without reverting to profanity or obscenity.The books are gripping and I get very involved in the stories and find them hard to put down.  Good writing, well-formed characters, solid plotting, suspense and a little romance keep me wanting to read more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EE3V5MO7FIQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OZ0NXA#wasThisHelpful","R1EE3V5MO7FIQJ","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved ""It's A Dilly"" and still have some, even though they stopped making it quite a few years ago.  This product is close, but does not quite make it.  Compare ingredients:McCormick It's A Dilly:Onion, garlic, dill weed, lemon peel, dill seed and jalapeno pepper.Engage Organics It's a Dilly:Garlic, sesame seed, dill, lemon peel, jalapeno pepper and STEVIA.That's right.  No onion, and they added sesame seed and STEVIA!  Ugh.  I can always taste the sugar substitutes in everything.  This may be all right with you if you use it in recipes that call for a bit of sweetness, but if you're looking for a more savory taste, this might not do it for you.  I use the McCormicks mainly in otherwise bland canned soups, and it really jazzes them up!  But now, I've got to taste STEVIA.  Bleech.  Not even sure it's safe.This is a nice company though, and I got a sample packet of several of their other spices when I received my order, along with a welcoming note.

"I wouldn't compare this to Harry Potter, which is filled with angst.  It is more like Narnia, which is lighter in tone, while still teaching important life lessons in a non-didactic, entertaining way.  It is filled with realistic child characters, figures from mythology, and battles between good and evil.  Our heroes are teenager Kendra who is a gentle goodie-two-shoes type, and her younger brother Seth who is brave and mischievous.  Their bickering is very realistic (although a little more funny and clever than I remember being) and entertaining.  I thought the author was good at creating situations that were genuinely difficult and which required love, discernment, courage and a growing maturity.  I could never guess what was coming next, and though the books are very suspenseful, the author did a great job of interweaving action with quieter moments of wisdom and strategy.  The creatures and the world he creates are very compelling and intricate.  I grew very fond of them.I read all five books through in a row, and though it's been a few days since I put them down, I still think about the characters, the world they lived in (which was beautiful), and the dilemmas they faced.  Very good, full of wisdom, fun and action.  Children (both boys and girls) and adults alike will love this story.Each of the five books was equally good.

"I heard the author interviewed on the Evidence 4 Faith podcast.  This is a podcast that is very committed  to the idea that the best reason for believing Christianity is because it's true--that there is evidence for it, that it's rational to believe it.  This book does a good job of illustrating exactly that.  It is very, very logical, but also straightforward, and while the laws of thermodynamics are not simple concepts, he does a good job of making them accessible as part of his argument.I think this would be a good book to read for anyone who wants to be able to answer challenges by agnostics, or just to help friends who are searching.  It is also a good read if you want to love God with your mind.  It's entertaining, intelligent, and amusing.As a fan of graphic novels, I don't find the illustrations as artistic as they could be, but they are workman-like and do the job.

"I ran across this book while I was browsing on Amazon one day, and was struck that one reviewer called it one of his favorite books of all times.  When the trilogy came up as the Amazon Daily Deal, I bought it, and while I can't call it one of my favorites of all times--that accolade would go to a book by Dickens or Trollope, or perhaps ""Middlemarch,"" but weeks after I read it, I'm still thinking about it.  Images from the book, particularly the parts that took place in Persia (in the eleventh century!) still are with me.This is a stand out novel, one that captures the imagination and is full of adventures and interesting characters and amazing settings.  There is danger and risk and lots of suspense, but the protagonist is equal to them all, and I found that highly satisfying.  Love, loss, passion, exotic settings, and also you will learn a bit about being a physician way back when before antibiotics and cat scans.Read it and enjoy the ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXX6ZRLWZT0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00840CY8Y#wasThisHelpful","RGXX6ZRLWZT0X","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite stylus is a free one my husband picked up at a trade show.  It has some heft to it, whereas these styli are lightweight.  But they seem solid, the colors are nice, and they work well for what I need them for--to doodle in Draw Something on the iPhone.  They come with a microfiber cloth and a couple of lanyards so you can attach the stylus to your phone.I also really appreciate that the seller--The Friendly Swede--really stands by his products.

"I read Peri Taichert's first novel, The Clovis Incident, for my book group and it was a fun read.  It was fresh as first novels often are, partly due to the author's lack of polish.  Still, it was good enough that I looked for another.  This one is better, with a tighter plot and a more confident writing style.  Her books remind me a little of those of Janet Evanovich--with less sex and romance.  Her protagonist, Sasha Solomon, is spunky and amusing, and the books are grounded in the culture and people of New Mexico.  The writing style is breezy and the book is a quick read, appropriate for beach, airplane or bedtime.The Kindle edition has a few problems.  The term ""m-dash"" actually appears in the text (that's an proofreader's word for the dash longer than a hyphen), and one chapter has the opening paragraph printed twice.  Another chapter, Chapter 52, left out paragraph breaks, so the whole chapter is one long paragraph. And there are some scattered typos (""one"" instead of ""on,"" for instance.)  I'm hoping the publisher or author will see these comments and see that the Kindle edition is corrected.I'm giving it four stars because it was very likeable.  It does not compare with the depth and intricacy of Tony Hillerman's novels, but it was a good read, entertaining and relatable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSG277K95OEQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EYTACW#wasThisHelpful","RSG277K95OEQG","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading the Amazon community reviews, I can see there is a wide divide, and while I appreciate some of the criticisms, my advice is to just jump into this novel and enjoy it.  If you're a woman, like I am, and a casual sports fan who knows enough about baseball to be able to visualize what the author is describing, you will like this novel because it will give you a deeper appreciation about baseball and sports, and because you'll have the opportunity to spend a large amount of time with some very interesting men.  As a woman, I always wonder what it would be like to be a man, and wonder how they think and feel and how they talk when no women are around, and this was a very satisfying way to experience that.Another reviewer said that the book had a 1950s vibe, and I think that's because there isn't a lot of vulgarity or swear words.  There is some frank sexuality (both homo- and hetero-sexuality) but it's not too prolonged, isn't gratuitous, and is easy to skim over if you want to.I loved the novel.  My niece is a professional athlete, and the challenges, practices and training these athletes went through seemed authentic to me.  I didn't think it was pretentious.  I didn't think the author was showing off his vocabulary, and when I was in college, we tended to refer to mythology or history or whatever it was we were studying, which is what these students do.  Maybe some of the things he described were a stretch, but when you're reading a novel, you have to accept the reality the author creates--if he's skilled at creating it, which this author is.When I got near to finishing the novel, I set it aside for half a day, because I didn't want it to end.  I didn't want to leave these characters behind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UABDG8WPJE0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QZ9PE2#wasThisHelpful","R1UABDG8WPJE0B","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Infectious disease physician Mark Crislip keeps a blog and this Kindle book is a collection of his first year's posts.  I enjoy medical writing for the inherent drama and the opportunity for learning, and I happened upon this book and decided to give it a try based on the five good reviews and the price of 99 cents.  I thought it would be good for desultory reading in between my more serious reads.  But I found myself reading it straight through.  I was a little disappointed at first, because I was hoping for more case histories, and the first 40% of blog posts are more didactic, but Dr. Crislip's personality won me over.  He's a self-admitted smart ass and a terrible punster, but that's the kind of humor I like.  I also learned a lot about what it's like to work in a hospital, as Dr. Crislip covers topics such as hand washing, MRSA, how to pronounce ""debride,"" and the controversy over vaccines (dumb-asses don't get them).At about 40% through, he really hits his stride and the blog becomes funnier and the stories are mostly about patients.  The case histories aren't thorough--you don't get names or nationalities (unless that is related to the disease in question),and you don't hear the patients talk.  You get their salient symptoms, and if you are a medical student, you might be able to guess at a diagnosis, and you will learn some of the questions that may appear in your boards.  If you're not a medical student, some of it will be over your head.  There are quite a few acronyms--some I was able to figure out (CXR = Chest X-Ray), some I couldn't.  But it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the posts.Also, as the author freely admits in his description, there are quite a few typos, and almost all of the apostrophes are wrong, wrong, wrong.  But the personality that seeps through the writing is winning enough that you forgive it all.I recommend this collection for anyone who enjoys medical writing or would like to get an idea of what it is like to be an infectious disease doctor working in a hospital environment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B7K4JZP2GFPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HB1Y8U#wasThisHelpful","R2B7K4JZP2GFPA","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that Winston Churchill referred to his depression as a ""black dog.""  So I understand the idea of using an actual black dog to explore the idea of depression.  But my very visual brain could not stop trying to understand how a dog could continuously and comfortably stand and talk and hold a tea cup.  Yes, he drinks tea, somehow holding the cup with his paw.  The tea spills out of his mouth, of course.  So was this a literal dog or a figurative dog?  Both, it seems, and that's where I lost interest.I hate the genre of magical realism.  I like fantasy and I like literature, but the magical realism hybrid is a beast best handled by an experienced and gifted writer, and this first time novelist was not that.  I did not find the characters interesting, and had to keep re-reading; my mind would drift off as I lost interest.  I stopped reading about a third of the way through.  It wasn't worth it.  I agree with some of the nay-sayers as well that her writing had a forced feeling to it.  Some of the metaphors were very awkward.I gave it three stars because I didn't finish reading it.

"This app is an excellent app on the iPhone, so I know that the software developers know what they're doing.  However, the Kindle Fire platform does not work as well.  I don't have the problem other users do with not having a SAVE button.  Just type in your note, hit the collapse keyboard button and the back button and your note will be saved.  Databases have always worked this way.  However, it should be one step, not two, so maybe a DONE button (like there is on the iPhone) is called for.  I'm guessing that can't be done on this platform.  Also, on the iPhone, you can collapse your notes so that you are looking at categories titles only.  If you limit yourself to 11 categories, you can see them all on the screen without scrolling.  On the Fire, it's just all your Note titles listed with the category names to the right. Anything more than 20 notes will be off the screen.  They are in category order, though, and you can select to view by category, but again, that's two steps when it should be one.The app is good for saving bits of information.  I use it to store all the little bits of information I don't want to forget:  restaurants I like; quotes I want to remember; codes, numbers and passwords; hours of operation of various businesses; dates to remember (like when I moved to my present home, when my piano teacher died, when I got the eaves painted); movies I want to watch; and books I have read.  You press the plus button to add a note, type in or select your category, type in a title, type in your content, press collapse keyboard, press the back button and you're done.  That's all there is to it.  (Of course, on the iPhone you can dictate your note--if you have the latest version phone).It's a simple, unfussy app without a lot of options, which is what I wanted to store my notes.  4 stars for the Fire.  5 stars for the iPhone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LNIX7LIKEJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CWO63W#wasThisHelpful","R27LNIX7LIKEJ1","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an adult, I occasionally read YA books because I find them fresh and largely free of cynicism, graphic sex and needless violence.  Also, it's fun to relive those days without actually, well, reliving them.  This book was no exception.  The book was fun; written in a breezy first-person narrative.  I won't describe the plot, as others have already done so.  I have read the preceding reviews, and I don't have a quibble with them.However.  The paranormal aspect of the novel feels tacked on.  Kelsee is suffering from classic anxiety attacks, but about a third of the way through the book, she realizes they're not anxiety attacks, they're the ability to manipulate time.  I had downloaded this book to my Kindle weeks before and had forgotten it was supposed to be paranormal.  The shift took me completely by surprise, mainly because the author had not prepared me for it.  It was as if she got bored with her own writing and wanted to pump it up.At the beginning of the book, Kelsee's mother is portrayed in a very negative light.  She is almost a caricature:  overbearing, egotistical, annoying.  After Kelsee's realization of her power, the mother is more realistically drawn--she is now seen to be hurting by Kelsee's preference for her father, and still smarting from the divorce.  This also feels like a weird change.  I'd almost bet the author put the book down for a while, then came back, and instead of starting over, wrote a different kind of novel (a better one) for the last two-thirds of the book.  Then, at the end of the novel another twist is added in which seems like another tacked on bit, probably suggested by the publisher in case they wanted to add sequels.The characters of the mother (in the last 2/3 of the novel), and the best friend, as well as of Kelsee herself, are pretty well drawn and their situations are realistic.  I think girls will like it because of this.  But for adults, it falls short.  The plotting is haphazard, some character lines are developed but not seen through, the dialogue sometimes a little glib.  But it's cheerful, earnest and does not drag.  Definitely worth the $2.99 price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OSOTLX7VUQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WE7F7G#wasThisHelpful","R15OSOTLX7VUQF","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just so you know, the year he's describing is the year that he was hired for several months to work as a staff writer for the show.  He didn't work there the entire year, so the actual ""on the set of Seinfeld"" is only a part of this autobiographical narrative.  That being said, we do get tiny snatches of conversation with and insight into the actors who play Elaine, George, and Kramer, along with a couple of glimpses of Jerry and Larry David.  Having been a fan of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" I enjoyed the Larry David scenes.  There are also some tidbits of interest about specific episodes.  The writers each worked in their individual offices, so there is no table time where the writers bounce ideas off one another.  What is the more interesting thing about this story is the peek into the life of a struggling actor.Fred Stoller is an engaging writer.  His story moves along at a nice clip and there are many chuckles to enjoy. The descriptions of his mother are really funny, and some of his friends are amusingly weird.  I felt that I was hanging around with a friend who was catching me up with his life:  we sat at a coffee shop and I was content to just listen and laugh.As an aside, just in case he reads this, he describes a funny use of words by his mother as a malapropos.  The word he really wanted was ""malapropism.""  I didn't even know malapropos was a word.  I thought he was committing his own malapropism by using it.  So thanks for teaching me a new word, Fred Stoller!

"I bought this novel looking for something that would bring me the same pleasure and stimulation I got from the BBC series ""Downton Abbey.""  I was disappointed.  Although the writing is not bad, and quite good in spots, the characters are not well fleshed out and it comes off as a romance novel, with a feisty and misbehaving young woman as its hero.  It does take you back to a time and place, but without the sense of urgency I should have felt for the protagonist whose parents are stuck in Austria at the time of the Nazi occupation and who is forced to enter service at a country manor house in England after having lived a privileged life.The premise sounds good, doesn't it?  I gave it a chance, reading about 30% of the book, but it just did not hold my interest.  It had aspirations, as another writer noted, to be another ""Rebecca"" or even ""Atonement"" in its plotting, but it is a shallow book.  The characters are not well formed--I don't get a sense of who these people are.  Not much happens.  However, if you are looking for a romance novel that is a quick read, you might enjoy this.  If you don't like the romance genre, give it a pass or wait until it's available at the library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FAYLT2TAW5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSZIYY#wasThisHelpful","R3FAYLT2TAW5X","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Watch out for a five-star review entitled ""A beautiful story"" by Iman, a young woman from the Netherlands.  The review gives away a major plot point.  Do not read that review if you have not yet read the book.Jamaica Inn is a very well written gothic novel.  Our heroine finds herself in a situation that is really terrible, and for me the book would have been intolerable if it were not for the fact that the main character, Mary Yellen, is a plucky, courageous and smart woman. The situation she finds herself in is terrible to think about, and makes the stakes very high. The characters are are well formed and interesting, and the setting is Cornwall, which becomes a character in itself; a brooding presence.Although sometimes referred to as a romance, Jamaica Inn has very little of the usual romance novel trappings.  It's more about how women can be strong and intelligent and not give in to their situations, written at a time when women were still being looked down upon as helpless beings who were not very smart.Spooky, thought-provoking and sometimes infuriating, this book seems like the spunky younger sister of the novel Rebecca.  If you haven't read Rebecca, you'll definitely want to after reading Jamaica Inn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8FLTQ2643JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380725398#wasThisHelpful","R1R8FLTQ2643JN","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a collection of 20-30 minute yoga videos.  Our host is Chaz, who is fun, engaging and humble. He tailors his videos according to email requests, so you'll find yoga for headaches, yoga for anxiety, yoga for skiers and snowboarders, along with some generic workouts and flows.  Chas describes himself as a real person-- not a ""rubber band""--in other words, he has tight hamstrings (although not as tight as mine).  He does a good job of guiding you through the practice in a quick and efficient way.  The sessions include warm up poses and an ending shivasana.  Drawbacks are the opening pitches for show sponsors (by Chaz), and the reading of the emails, but it's done quickly so I usually spend that time getting my mat set up and tying back my hair.  Also, there's a feature to star your favorite routines, but it doesn't work on the Kindle Fire.  The stars disappear.  And Chaz stops to explain things once in a while which could get tiresome if you used that video a lot.  And the volume on the Fire is so low that I had to buy an external speaker so that I could get it loud enough to hear over a little bit of household noise.

"First of all, this was written for the Wii Fit before the Wii Fit Plus was available, so it doesn't address any of the Plus exercises and games.  In fact, some of the exercise names were different back then.Secondly, this book is very short: about 81 page turns on a Kindle.I have been using the Wii Fit Plus program for about eight months now, and am frustrated with a few exercises (snowboard slalom and the balance bubble) and was hoping this book might help me advance in these exercises.  It did not.  Most of the descriptions are minimal; many just reiterate the game's initial instructions or what the trainer tells you.  Cheats include putting something heavy on the balance board for the Lotus Focus. (He doesn't recommend this, but this is juat an example of one of his cheats, and there aren't very many of them--perhaps as few as three.)  His very short hints for the yoga poses are things that yoga beginners already know, and include instructions the trainer gives you.  Perhaps there was no trainer back then?By Googling, I found a hint for the skateboard game.  The suggestion was to hang your toes off the board, which really helped me advance through several levels.  This is the type of hint I was hoping for, but there was nothing that helpful.I am also sick to death of the Wii Fit trainer telling me I'm ""very shaky.""  My balance is good, and I have a theory that my low weight might have something to do with the shakiness, so I was hoping to find more information about the way the balance board works, so that I could stop this from happening.  I did not.The author does put together an exercise routine for you, grouping the exercises into body areas exercised. But the Wii Fit Plus will create an exercise routine for you automatically, so I didn't find his suggestions helpful.I gave the book two stars instead of one because I appreciated the author's helpful tone and clear writing.  He did suggest putting your foot in the center of the balance board when doing the one-legged exercises, and I will try that. And possibly this was more helpful for Wii Fit users before the Wii Fit Plus was available.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CE3TU30LRUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PTH13O#wasThisHelpful","R33CE3TU30LRUK","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked my Kindle 2.  I only had one problem with it.  The 5-way controller broke.  I read a lot and use the controller quite frequently to make notes and look up words.  Amazon sent me a new Kindle immediately on my extended warranty.The Kindle 3 is a worthy upgrade, particularly if you use the CONTROLLER a lot.  The new controller is better and seems more durable.  It's very intuitive to use, very simple.  There was no adjustment period for me.Other changes:KEYBOARD.  The keyboard has been simplified to include letters and a few other buttons, such as menu, home, back etc. with the numbers now relegated to the SYM box.  The keyboard itself is tacky where the other one was smooth, making it easier to type on.  The keys are closer together, but that doesn't affect the ease of typing.  The Home, Menu and Back buttons have been moved to the keyboard area, and are rectangular in shape, to distinguish them from the letter keys.PAGE TURNS.  The only controls at the side are now the page turns, so there is a next page and a previous page on both sides of the Kindle, which I had often longed for.  These page turn buttons are much smaller, and it might take you a few page turns to get used to where they are.  It's easy to turn pages, and much quieter. You don't have to push the buttons inward anymore, and I doubt you'll ever pick up the Kindle by the page turn buttons, inadvertently turning the pages, which was the main trouble with the first generation Kindle.  The page turns are also noticeably quicker.SIZE.  It is smaller and thinner, but no so much that it feels fragile or insubstantial, especially if you buy a cover for it (which I recommend).INK.  The e-ink really is quite a bit darker.  It was dark enough for me in the Kindle 2, but I suppose it's a little easier to read in low light, and the words of Jesus in the red letter bibles are easier to read as well.WIFI.  I bought the wifi only version, and it was incredibly easy to set up.  You only need the name of the wifi network and the network password.COLOR.  If you have a choice, I would recommend the white if you use the keyboard a lot.  It's hard to see the keyboard at night with the darker color, even if you have one of those covers with the built-in light. You can't get the wifi-only version in white, unfortunately.TYPE FACES, etc.  You can now choose from a regular, condensed or sans serif font, and line spacing of small, medium or large.  It doesn't look to me like there are any larger or smaller sized typefaces.  There is nothing different for Text-to-Speech.That's about it.  I am very happy with all the changes. I recommend upgrading if you use the controller a lot because it will break eventually.  Also if you need faster page turns and darker text, these changes are noticeable, and would justify an upgrade.  Otherwise, continue to enjoy your Kindle 2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKPH2UXM6JIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Y27P3M#wasThisHelpful","RAKPH2UXM6JIX","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The recommendations are for mostly fiction, but there are some non-fiction picks as well, such as Why We Can't Wait by Martin Luther King, Jr.  There are even a few collections of poetry--Lawrence Ferlinghetti and T.S. Eliot are among the poets included.I'm not sure why it's arranged as a devotional--with one title to each day of the year, but no matter.  For each day you will find the title of a book, the opening sentence of the book, a synopsis of the book which includes a summary and a musing on the reasons for the book's popularity or significance, and an ending quote from either the author of the book, a reviewer or a fellow writer.My only complaint is that the date the book was published should have been prominently displayed.  You can usually find it in the summary, but it takes a bit of scanning.  Also, in the introduction there was no explanation for the basis on which the books were chosen or the thought behind the organization of the book.That being said, I do like the picks.  Most of my favorites were included (The Once and Future King, Bonfire of the Vanities, The Woman in White, Middlemarch, Bleak House, To Kill A Mockingbird). If you're very well read, you have probably read about half of these or more.  But I think everyone will find reminders of books they wanted to read, suggestions for books they had never heard of, and a way to find out if you've already read the book.  Also, it's a godsend for book clubs who struggle to chose the next book.I bought the hardback and it's a very handsome book in green and red, nicely bound.  The pages are not of particularly high quality (not slick and shiny), but it looks like the book should hold up for many years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTA53779P7RS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605501050#wasThisHelpful","RVTA53779P7RS","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read about two or three books by Sue Miller and I really like her writing.  However, I didn't like this book.  I listened to the audio version that was read by Blair Brown.  I like her rendition.  She has a good voice for reading--smooth and intelligent.  She doesn't do men's voices well, but that's my only complaint.I didn't find the story compelling.  I can see that others did, but it felt to me as if nothing happened, which is usually not a complaint of mine.  (I loved ""Gilead."")  I listened to most of the book, but took it back to the library after I had finished listening to about 90% of the story.  I just didn't care enough to finish it.  Also, I read some of the reviews on Amazon and saw that it had a bad (sad?) ending, so I decided not to finish it.One quibble abot the audio.  It did not inform the listener of the ending of the CD.  I appreciate it when they tell me ""end of CD number one.""

"This is my first Robert B. Parker novel, and I'm listening to it in the car.  My attention has been spotty, as I get distracted by my driving and thoughts, so I won't review the story.  I will say that the reading is very well done.  Joe Montegna handles both men's and women's voices well and attempts to give each character a distinctive voice.  He's not always completely successful at this as there are many characters, but he brings out the subtleties of the dialogue nicely.  I thought his characterization of Hawk was especially well done.  The only thing I didn't like was all the ""he said"" ""I said"" and ""she saids.""  This is easy to filter out when you are reading; a little harder when listening.  But if you like audio books, this is definitely good quality.One quibble:  I wish all audio books would add a statement like ""end of CD number 1.""

"I read this book for my mystery book club and I was not disappointed.  I found the book compelling, intelligent, and full of interesting situations and characters. It was a long book, but I didn't want it to end!  It's refreshing to read a book that's modern but doesn't contain graphic depictions of sex or loads of profanity.  The book is written in first person by a Christian man, and his protagonist, Talcott Garland, is a Christian man who struggles to follow his faith the best that he can, often failing yet never giving up.  The story includes conversations with a preacher that are serious discussions about what it means to be a follower of Christ.  There are also confrontations (a lot of them!) with colleagues and family members who have their own reasons for objecting to some of Professor Garland's behavior.  I found him sympathetic and frustrating, just like people in real life.Reading this book also affords the reader the opportunity to crawl inside the mind of a black man in America.  How does he view white people?  How does he perceive that white people view him?  Along the way, you might be surprised to find you have some prejudices of your own (I was).The language is erudite but not ostentatious--the author is not showing off (as I often felt William Styron was); both the author and his main character are educated and intelligent men who work at a university.  I learned a few new words (apercu and kilim), but it's not one of those books where you have to look up every third word.It's good to read a book that is concerned with ethics and morals and that is really about something.  The mystery was good too--expertly crafted so that I could guess part of it but be mystified by other parts.  The solution was satisfying, but left a few loose ends, again, just like real life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18AUJD2D7N0K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375712925#wasThisHelpful","R18AUJD2D7N0K5","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read quite a few Victorian novels, including the works of Trollope, Dickens, Eliot and Wilkie Collins.  This isn't Collins' best or most compelling work (those honors belonging to The Moonstone and The Woman in White, of course), but it is still entertaining, well written and a pretty quick read.  The story revolves around an adopted deaf and dumb girl, her adoptive parents and the mystery of her biological parentage.  The characters are well drawn, but there is no grand love story as there usually is in Victorian novels.The Kindle version I read was just fine.  The dictionary worked, the font was fine, there were very few typos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53ZK025ONER6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001405ZOG#wasThisHelpful","R53ZK025ONER6","A1ZST491WTFMO9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZST491WTFMO9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SoundTouch 130 was a breeze to setup, and that is a plus.  Compared to clunky wired surround sound systems, this literally just had one wire from the base module that runs to the sound bar and high speed HDMI master out that runs to the TV.  All of your components, cable/satellite, game consoles etc.  plug into the Bose base unit and pass-through  to the TV through the single high speed HDMI out.  The base unit allows for 4k pass-through to the TV so you are future proof on any new 4K equipment you may decide to add in the futureAs far as sound, this unit is not going to beat your wired 5 or 7 point surround sound systems, it just physically impossible.  This is a single bar that sits in front of your TV and a wireless rear sub.  That being said, the sound this produces is LIGHT YEARS better than anything your TV speakers alone could pull off.  It does a good job of simulating right and left channel speakers that really do at times give you the sense the action is happening just to the left or right of you.  This action however all still feels INFRONT of you and you won’t get that bullets whizzing by and hearing them behind you sense you do with a formal rear speaker surround sound setup.The wireless sub produces some decent bass but I was bit disappointed given the price of this unit.  I expected a much deeper, shake the floors sub for a unit in this price range.  It does produce some great lows and is pretty compact and easy to place but for me anyway, I feel it is a bit lacking.  A big plus for the sub though is its wireless signal does not interfere with my home wifi router like some cheaper brand wireless units have been known to do.  Nothing is worse than turning on your surround sound only to find you can’t stream the movie because the signal is jammed by the wireless speakers!Another nitpicky complaint from me is the display on the front of the unit is small and hard to read from a distance.  There has been more than one occasion where I’ve had to get up and walk towards the TV in order to read the display to adjust sound settings.  It would be nice if the display could travel through the pass through and give me a display on the TV itself.This unit does have the Bose SoundTouch unit which syncs with a separate smart phone app which allows you to stream your streaming music services, music  from your phone or internet radio services.  It does a solid job at this and setup was as easy as plugging the SoundTouch unit into the base unit and downloading the app.  Had it up and running in less than 5 min.  Nice feature for music during  parties.All in all it does a solid job for a sound bar but don’t be mistaken in thinking this is a 1 for 1 replacement for a proper 5 or 7 speaker surround sound.  If you are new to surround sound or looking for a minimal install, small footprint sound solution this Bose unit is going to impress you.  If you are looking for a true cinematic experience, you will find this unit lacking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRC186Z8AHXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MPU#wasThisHelpful","RYRC186Z8AHXO","A31AVXMESQRQAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31AVXMESQRQAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have to say I think I enjoyed doing one and lighing it up as much as my granddaughter did! This is just really cool.

"=============================Comment added on 31 October 2013-AmazonBasics lists three different antennas under one sales entry point but there are major differences in antenna size and reception.  Selecting the right antenna will make a difference in the broadcast [OTA] signals your television set receives.  My advice is begin by using this site[...]  [antennaweb dot org]and follow the steps using the ZIP code for your location, and then choose which of these three antennas might work best for your local area.======================================I considered the Mohu Leaf products but decided on this AmazonBasics model because prior buys of AmazonBasics cables has proved their worth as a product line to me, saving 15 dollars over a similar Leaf was a plus.  I used a zip code based search service to see how many channels are available in my geographic area, 18 in total.  With the AmazonBasics amped antenna 16 is exactly what I receive after removing some duplicate non-HD repeater signals and learning two listed stations are private and coded.  Excellent reception as I'm approximately 10 to 30 miles away from the originating signals.Unpacking was easy as was connecting the cable to my television set, selecting channel signal type to ""Antenna"", and running ""Auto Program"".  Bingo!, bright and clear picture and sound on the first try placing the antenna on an inside wall about six feet up.I choose the amplified antenna because of my location and signal reception concerns, in hindsight I might have been able to use the AmazonBasics standard non-amplified antenna, but I went for the possible boost in reception performance for my location and distance from signals.Very satisfied with antenna and results.Konrad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHLPLD5XBL60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIFIP06#wasThisHelpful","R1LHLPLD5XBL60","A250EBBMPAEAN5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250EBBMPAEAN5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have long been a fan of Walter Mosley, especially his Easy Rawlins series of mysteries.  Mosley's fiction is sufficiently insightful and grounded in intuition born of real-world experience that, at its best, it can change the way we view the world.  The revised vision is unlikely to be uplifting, but it's certainly more accurate, truer to the way things really work.One of the reasons that Mosley's work is so compelling is that, in contrast to any other author of noir-like fiction known to me, Mosley is Black.  Thus Easy Rawlins is a rare character, indeed: a Black noir protagonist in stories usually set in the '50's or '60'a, before or in the midst of the mid-Twentieth Century civil rights movement.  Rawlins understands what it means to be Black in a deeply racist society dominated by Whites, enabling him to teach us lessons that many of us otherwise would never learn.To his credit, however, Mosley's protagonist, Easy Rawlins. is no social and cultural one-trick pony, beating us over the head, however skillfully, with race-related wisdom, insights, and abominations.  Rawlins is an astute and sensitive observer who recognizes that poor Whites are nearly as powerless and generally disadvantaged as poor Blacks. Not infrequently, he comes close to making the observation that social class, as manifest in the development of the capitalist system,  is the fundamental phenomenon that determines who does well and who does poorly even more decisively than race.In Mosley's non-fiction book Workin' on the Chain Gang he takes the leap intimated in his Easy Rawlins series, and invokes class as more fundamental than race in determining who we are, what opportunities are available to us, and what we become.  Though he doesn't put it in just this way, Mosley's position might best be captured by paraphrasing the Black sociologist O. C. Cox in his book Caste, Class, and Race:  the primary difference between Blacks and Whites in our capitalist society is that Blacks have been more thoroughly proletarianized.  Blacks are, in other words, more effectively divorced from ownership and control of the means of production and finance, and they have less control over their lives.  Cox's book, however, was published in 1950, and writing fifty years later Mosley sees that the difference between Blacks and Whites has dramatically diminished.Mosley has never been shy about putting things directly and without a political coward's equivocation.  Thus, having acknowledged the place of slavery in the development of the United States and much of the rest of the world, his judgment that capitalism reduces both Blacks and Whites to the status of slaves may be unexpected, but it's not shocking.  Mosley's controversial, even inflammatory, point is that profit is the only fundamental value, and markets are the only sacred institutions in a capitalist context.  In a way that is obviously suggestive of Marx, Mosley maintains that the capitalist world reduces human beings to the status of commodities, things that can be rendered in dollar terms, depending on the value of the labor that went into producing them.Mosley, however, rejects the idea that he is a Marxist or that he can be neatly subsumed by any other political-economic label.  I think he prefers to see himself in the role of a non-violent humanist, one who wants to promote freedom in a world that already has the technological wherewithal to provide material abundance for everyone.  We miss this chance, however, because, for the capitalist system with its small set of shakers and movers, this is not the most nakedly profitable way to proceed.Whether we agree with him or not, Mosley's analysis is an act of courage, given that he may very well alienate prospective readers of his fiction, perhaps sharply diminishing his royalties.  Even if he's already wealthy, by taking this risk Mosley makes it a good deal less likely that he will be judged a hypocrite.While Mosley's analysis of capitalism, complete with the devolution of people of all races to slave status, is interesting and unanticipated, it is also thoroughly derivative.  The bulk of the book, however, is devoted to discussion of five ways in which individuals and nascent groups can transform our world such that freedom, abundance, and the chance to fully develop our innate potential characterizes everyone's life.  Each reader can make his or her own judgment, but I found the transformative tools proposed by Mosley to be hopelessly lame.  In fairness to the author, however, Workin' on the Chain Gang takes on the pattern of countless other social commentaries and proposals for reform:  an incisive, even original and compelling analysis, followed by obviously ineffective proposals for remediation.  We're pretty good at diagnosing social ills, but curing them is beyond our capabilities.I've benefited from everything I've ever read by Walter Mosley.  In spite of my serious doubts as to his sometimes utopian proposals for thoroughgoing and beneficial reform, Workin' on the Chain Gang is a book that merits a broad readership.  It's a book in which Mosley can justifiably take pride for its embodiment of cultivated intelligence and a forthright stance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAINLU1ESD8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4IKA5A#wasThisHelpful","R2PAINLU1ESD8B","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terry Eagleton is one of my favorite authors of the exposition of ideas and theoretical developments in social and cultural theory from the point of view of a student of the humanities.  I've read more of Eagleton's books than those by any other author of comparable material, and I've always found him insightful, informative, and challenging but accessible.Eagleton's prose style is uniquely sophisticated, neither trendy nor distorted by the constraints of a particular persepective, and he's written knowledgeably about every influential social and cultural theory that comes to mind.  Whether writing about modernism, post-modernism, psychoanalysis, structuralism, post-structuralism, the close reading of the Leavasites, or any other distinctive body of literature, Eagleton's style has remained largely unaltered, avoiding surrender to locutions, affectations, and fantastically elaborate conceptual frameworks that may be peculiar to the body of work he's discussing.  Eagleton understands that writing about Marx doesn't oblige him to adopt Marx's often turgidly Hegelian prose style, and the same applies to the distinctive modes of written expression peculiar to other authors.  This is all to the good.It seems, however, that all of us, whatever our lines of endeavor, are subject to youthful indiscretions, especially when we get caught up in the most fashionable and ostensibly powerful manifestations of our work at a particular time.  I suppose this is as good an explanation as any for Eagleton's 1976 book Criticism and Ideology, better, I think, than the account offered by Eagleton himself in this edition. In this early volume Eagleton adopts the concepts, approach to theory, set of pertinent issues, and mode of presentation of Louis Althusser and his Structural Marxist acolytes, and he endeavors to make them his theoretical foundation.  Sadly, a really bad call!In truth, Structural Marxism was an influential project that was not totally without value.  Its unapologetic denial of simple-minded notions of free will, while retaining the illusory reality of individual freedom, was exemplary.  Much the same is true of the notion that material experience precedes and takes precedence over consciousness, and that individuals may be construed as unself-conscious props that maintain the multifaceted social structures that create them.While Althusser pushed the ideas of relative autonomy and determinant in the last instance too far, he disabused us of over-simplifying the still instructive base/superstructure configuration.  Commonsense instrumentalism, moreover, was eliminated once and for all by Althusser's Structural Marxism, and he invoked the concept production in a way that lent itself to application to literary studies.Nevertheless, I can't see much in what I've just attributed to Althusser that was not explicitly stated, or at least clearly implicit, in Marx's own work. In addition, to glean even this much from Althusser forces the reader to try to come to terms with a maddeningly unreadable convoluted exercise in literary self-indulgence masquerading as theoretical rigor.  Anyone who has Read Althusser's best known book, Reading Capital, will immediately understand my point.Althusser's strained efforts to write theory with meticulous precision rendered his prose, for all practical purposes, unreadable.  Much as with Althusser's work, a good deal of Eagleton's Criticism and Ideology is needlessly difficult and pointlessly obscure.  While Criticism and Ideology is not without merit, too much of it is an extraordinarily tedious exercise in conceptually excessive sleight-of-hand that, when all is said and done, presents us mainly with a rigid framework of static ideas whose interrelationships are as numerous and slippery as they are hopelessly obscure.  Is Literary Mode of Production (LMP) a useful concept?  You tell me.  After a while, I get sick of being told ""you may think <this>, but I really mean <that>,"" with qualifications, of course.Remarkably, however, the first thirty pages of Eagleton's third chapter approach intelligibility, and may have some genuinely interesting things to say.  It's as if Eagleton had tamed Structural Marxism and made it work.  The discussion explaining the simple causal models at the bottom of page 68 is especially interesting.Abruptly, however, the material that showed promise and prompted me to briefly second-guess my thoroughly unfavorable assessment of Structual Marxism as a monstrously clumsy joke, a parody of needlessly dense and proudly inelegant theoretical work, gave way to the same old Althusserianism.There's more to Criticism and Ideology than Eagleton's uncharacteristic surrender to Structural Marxism, but the cryptically annoying Althusserianism seems to have spoiled it for me, and I'm afraid I failed to do it justice.  However, elsewhere Eagleton has written so much that is so good that it's easy to forgive him the sins of Criticism and Ideology.  After all, any of us can get caught up in a fashionable mode of discourse and theorizing, especially when we've struggled mightily to use it in the way of its master, and find that, whether or not we're making sense, we get favorable responses from others who have taken the same route.  I had a very similar experience using Harold Garfinkel's ethnomethodology in the '70's and early '80'.In any case, I don't know why Criticism and Ideology is back in print, perhaps for historical interest.  I suspect that Eagleton would just as soon forget that he wrote it.  I spent more time than I like to admit with this relatively short book and found it to be a source of enormous frustration, with little of intelligibility or interest to say about either criticism or ideology.  Eagleton's references to Raymond Williams seem oddly out of synch with -- even unrelated to -- my reading of Willaims' Marxism and Literature.  Perhaps this is because I spent too much time trying to decipher Eagleton's Althusserianism, neglecting less contaminated parts of the book.  Irritation and understanding don't go hand in hand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12G2TIHKOQYBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0902308920#wasThisHelpful","R12G2TIHKOQYBV","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christopher Datta's novel, Touched with Fire, is the first book in a trilogy set in the Civil War Era.  In the first volume, the protagonist, born Ellen Smith, or simply Ellie, is in many ways the unfortunate personification of the inevitably corrupting influence of slavery on all other institutions.Ellie herself is a loving, good-hearted, but painfully reserved young woman, who, though a slave, is white.  This anomaly is explained by the fact that both her maternal grandmother and her mother were raped and impregnated by their white masters.  Ellen was born, thus, as a quadroon, one quarter black, and her skin color was as white as any of the slave masters or their other children.Nevertheless, as far as Whites were concerned, Ellie was Black, and as far as other Blacks were concerned, she was uppity.  After all, Ellie worked in the plantation mansion of her white father, and she wore the hand-me-down clothes of her white sisters.  In a limited sense, she was advantaged, but at great cost?Her father bore her no affection, in fact he sometimes looked at her lustfully, as if he might rape her much as he did her mother.  In his view, she was not his daughter but his property, much as any other slave. a commodity that could be used, bought, and sold.  Unloved by her father, Ellie longed to feel her mother's warm and affectionate embrace, but her mother had been sold to a planter who lived much further south, and Ellie was never to see her again.  Slavery had destroyed their loving relationship, leaving her effectively orphaned and alone.Deemed legally and culturally unfit for White society, and rejected by envious Blacks who did not understand her true status and circumstances, Ellie was a marginal person with no ties to anyone, save those constitutive of slavery.  While many suitable males found Ellie attractive, she rejected them and the prospect of marriage.  Ellie was determined not to bring children into the world as slaves to live the kind of fettered-by-evil existence that she lived.  Beyond that, she, any man she might have married, and any children she might have borne could be sold to anyone at any time, thus fracturing whatever family they had managed to create.  The uncertainty of slave life was inconsistent with the settled and cohesive existence implied by concepts such as family and community.Ellie did not want to bring into the world children who, by force of law, would be denied even a rudimentary education.  Moreover, her experience with organized religion, as it was available to slaves, had brutally convinced her that their White masters had rendered even the church an institution where Black slaves could be systematically exploited with impunity.  What sort of life could Ellie offer any children she might bare?Nevertheless, she and a fellow slave, William Craft, met, fell in love, and married through a series of chance encounters, some of which, ironically, further emphasized the brutality of slavery. However, much as she had feared, Ellie and William were forcibly separated.  Much of the book recounts Ellie's efforts to return to William in the hope of setting him free and resuming their marriage under far more auspicious circumstances.It makes little difference what parts of Touched with Fire are concretely accurate and what parts are fiction.  Taken as a whole, I found the book's primary contribution and source of interest to be the ways in which it graphically, and true to the spirit of the times, illustrates the corrupting influence of slavery for all institutions and relationships.  Religion, marriage, the family, the nature of labor, the system of property holding, the mode of commerce were all grotesquely distorted by the ugly transformation of slaves to the status of commodities to be used as plantation owners saw fit.The influence of slavery in the corruption of language, especially when referring to abstract terms such as liberty and freedom, is fascinating, and developed by the author with suitably sardonic humor.  For northern abolitionists, these terms were inextricably tried to the elimination of slavery and the freeing of Blacks.  For southern planters, however, the same abstract qualities were used in emphatic reference to avoidance of the intrusion of northern interests, whether morally motivated abolitionists or economically acquisitive manufacturers, into the business of slave holders.  For the southern aristocracy, freedom and liberty were best understood as the freedom to own slaves and the liberty to use them as they chose.  This was the foundation of affluent southerners' way of life.Touched with Fire is unusual in my experience in that it properly addresses the abomination of slavery as a perniciously destructive caste/class phenomenon in conjunction with what passed for suitable sex roles at the time, a contentious topic even today.  It may be saying to much to assert that a determined woman is the physical and martial equal of most men, but Touched with Fire tacitly raises that possibility.  As with race, one is prompted to wonder how much of the differences traditionally ascribed to men and women were more a matter of socialization than intrinsic capabilities.Touched by Fire is an extremely interesting and well-written book.  The author is an insightful observer of the human condition, and he has an uncanny historical intuition.  Touched with Fire is a book with much of value to say about human nature, life, and the institutional arrangements that constitute specific kinds of societies.  Even for those who do not read the second and third volumes in the trilogy, the first volume is remarkably instructive in unexpected ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ8RY6JD694N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DN7Z2PK#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ8RY6JD694N","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Smith's prose style is so uncluttered,straightforward, and direct that it sometimes seems almost glib, but that's nothing to complain about.  I think that all readers prefer a quick and easy read to something that's slow, awkward, and needless convoluted.Substantively, however, The Fourth Amendment is a bit misleading, bringing to mind the notion of bait and switch.  Yes, I think we all agree that Fourth Amendment issues have become far more salient with the advent of the digital age, but that's a pretty vague notion.  Specific instances in which the Fourth Amendment is of primary concern are few and far between in Smith's perhaps mistitled book.  It's true that the protagonist, cyber-sleuth Chris Storm, is sensitive to the point of ""boiling"" when she suspects that organizational superiors or colleagues are not sufficiently attuned to Fourth Amendment protections.  Truth be told, however, the events she finds so upsetting rarely occur.I suppose, however,we could say that given the nature of her work, Fourth Amendment concerns always have a high profile.  That, however, seems to be cutting the author too much slack.  As things stand, we've got a pretty good book that makes one wonder if the author was looking for a title to give all that he had written a focused meaning.  As a result, when specific Fourth Amendment questions are raised, they seem adventitious, oddly intrusive, and put there for no good reason other than to give the book a catchy name.  It's also a bit too predictable that as the book develops, Kris' commitment to a strict constructionist interpretation of the Fourth Amendment begins to wane.While Smith writes quite well, his rendering of an espionage thriller is disappointing.  The Fourth Amendment, especially the novel's first half, might best be described as bland.  The author is talented, to be sure, but he invests entirely too much into describing the clothes, hair styles, and office and apartment furnishings of the characters we meet.  Some of them, especially Chris, are nicely developed, but I think this would have been a much more interesting story if Smith had devoted more of his estimable authorial resources to substantive issues rather than ancillary details.  Clearly, Smith wants to tell us that his most important characters on the right side of the law are young, affluent, Ivy League, urban, professionals.  But his descriptions of the sartorial incidentals that bespeak their status occur too frequently and soon become uninteresting, even boring.Sure, there is some action, adventure, violence, and duplicity in The Fourth Amendment, but the book remains short on excitement and anticipatory tension.  As we move toward the end, the novel offers some pretty wild and far-fetched people and predicaments.  It's not bad material, but it's too little, too late, and too contrived.  It seems that, with a few exceptions, Smith spent too much time making the case that digitally dazzling people like Chris and her subordinates, Mindy and Joe, are the only ones worthy of serious consideration, and that those of lesser or different attainments, as well as older folks, are gross and otherwise fatally flawed.  Why else, at a formal banquet for the mayor, insert a fat, gluttonous, middle aged, traditional union boss uncaringly dragging his necktie through his gravy?  Why else make the bumbling, inarticulate, thoroughly hapless and corrupt Public Advocate be the only character in the book who is explicitly a political liberal, maybe even a champion of Romney's 47 percent?  OK, these may be examples of sub-texts, but when they remain undeveloped they serve the same purpose as cheap jeans bought at Wal-Mart, the sort of thing that Chris and her colleagues wouldn't be caught dead wearing.  They're just labels.SM Smith is a talented writer, and he gives ample evidence of being generally well informed.  Furthermore, he knows enough about computer technology and the value of large data bases to write convincingly about cyber-sleuthing, online crime, and similarly up-to-speed issues.  It would be really useful, however, if he got an editor who would aggressively insist that he stay on topic, not dither unduly with incidentals, and further develop his unstated but pretty obvious assumptions.  After all, everyone has biases, but a writer who betrays his or hers must put them to good use.This review is not especially favorable, but there is a good deal of merit to Smith's novel.  Unfortunately, there is a lot about it that is annoying and disappointing.  Smith might step back, take stock from a variety of vantage points, and next time not sell himself short with a book that's a lot less engaging than his talent might have made it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RWOFKJOPPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508719128#wasThisHelpful","R10RWOFKJOPPL","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heather Voight's book Passionate Crusaders is a valuable addition to the body of scholarship that has come to be known as Holocaust Studies.  Voight's volume, however, is very different from work such as Doris Bergin's masterful War and Genocide.Bergin reports in graphically brutal detail the nature of the Holocaust itself.  She shows us the routinized butchery organized by its perpetrators, the immeasurably painful price paid by its millions of victims, and the modernized effectiveness of the social machinery that made killing on a truly massive scale a logistical possibility.  As an account of the twelve-year triumph of evil as a continental phenomenon, War and Genocide is gut-wrenching, heart-breaking, and takes an emotional toll on any normally sensitive reader.Voight, by maddening contrast, documents the studied indifference of all but a small minority of international bystanders.  Even though the U.S. State Department sought to suppress pertinent information, the nature of the Holocaust was no secret in the United States or elsewhere.  Nevertheless, until the last two years of World War II, organized opposition to the Nazi's final solution and sustained efforts to rescue and provide aid to Jews and others targeted by Hitler was a small-scale and private matter.  Not until the January of 1944 did FDR, at the behest of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Treasury, create the War Refugee Board (WRB), an under-funded agency with a staff of thirty, that had little independent clout, and came with powerful bureaucratic enemies already in place.In spite of the widely shared judgment that the WRB offered much too little much too late too accomplish its humanitarian ends, it Executive Director and other officials and operatives took their jobs very seriously, indeed.  They struggled to contrive ways to provide direct or indirect assistance to Jews in, or headed for, the Third Reich's death camps, and did so with substantial opposition from within their own government.The WRB also had to contend with the unfortunate fact that anti-Semitism was a persuasively shameful attribute shared by many Americans.  This helps to explain why FDR was in no hurry to act to aid victims of the evolving Holocaust.  As with most politicians, he placed political expedience above other considerations, and by his nature he seemed not favorably disposed toward those ethnically different from his understanding of the wholesome nature of ordinary Americans.  Taken together, these two factors may help to account for his willingness to ignore the tightening of immigration quotas to the disadvantage of European Jews, as well as his endorsement of internment of Japanese Americans, and his failure to champion the cause of oppressed Blacks.The more we learn about the Holocaust the more tarnished become the reputations of FDR and other politically significant Twentieth Century American's of prominence, including Edward Stettinius, Sumner Welles, and John J. McCloy.  Even when it was clear to all that the Nazis were defeated, men such as these continued to give voice to the disingenuous mantra that the best way to diminish the toll paid by the most inhumanely oppressed, the ones virtually certain to be victims of the ongoing slaughter, was to devote all resources to the war effort, diverting nothing to save the condemned.  Whether motivated by anti-Semitism, poor judgment, or the popular belief that America should be preserved for Americans, these State Department officials did all they could to thwart and stall the best efforts of the WRB.  Voight's book provides a detailed and disturbing lesson regarding the ways that special interests, pernicious prejudices, and simple miscalculations of one set of bureaucrats can be turned against the good work of another, something that occurs daily on an international stage.In spite of functioning in a generally hostile environment, by the author's estimate the WRB contributed to saving 130.000 lives.  Some prominent historians have placed the number as high as 200,000.  Those saved were not limited to the relatively small number who escaped the death camps and their gas chambers, but included those who survived beyond the defeat of the Nazis because they received food packages distributed through the joint efforts of the WRB and organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Furthermore, the WRB's efforts at psychological warfare, aimed at persuading Nazi officials and their underlings of their culpability and the certainty that they would be dealt with as war criminals prevented the execution of an indeterminate number of Jews.  The WRB also became familiar with the judgment that any Nazi, however zealous he seemed, could be bought, and they occasionally put that information to good use.  The WRB was tenacious, innovative, and courageous in carrying out its mission until the very end of hostilities.It's true that 130,000 saved is an unimpressive total when compared with 6,000,000 lost.  But who, other than the most doctrinaire neoclassical economist,  is sufficiently audacious to place a value on even one life.  Truth be told, in view of the opposition and opportunism it encountered domestically and internationally, the WRB achieved an impressive record of success.I noted at the outset that Voight's book was maddening when read with Bergin's War and Genocide.  That so little was done in comparison to what might have been accomplished elevates frustration and shame to new levels.  Still, the WRB must be credited with doing the work of people with humane principles, not dissuaded by petty biases or personal gain, but motivated by bravery and recognition that one human being has as much right to live and prosper as any other.  The efforts of the WRB remove a bit of the tarnish from America's otherwise failed response to the Holocaust.  Thanks to Heather Voight's clearly written book based on her skillful scholarship, all Americans can take pride in the work of the WRB. A good book that merits a broad readership.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFI0ZKOXNLRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990305201#wasThisHelpful","R1FFI0ZKOXNLRJ","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dennis Lehane is a prolific and talented author of prose fiction dealing with crime, criminals, victims, and those trying to set things straight. The quality of his novels ranges from really good, as in Live by Night, to one-of-the-best-ever, as in The Drop.  Prayers for Rain is comfortably situated somewhere between the two, roughly comparable to Gone, Baby, Gone.When I first started reading Lehane, I characterized his work as noir or neo-noir. It has the gritty, street-wise appeal of books written by noir pioneers from the '30's and '40's such as still-read authors like Dashell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain.  The noir characterization usually fit pretty well, subsuming harsh qualities and themes including official corruption, personal betrayal, gratuitous cruelty, and deep-seated cynicism that was readily understandable as a product of badly flawed characters and the ugly contexts in which they lived.  The protagonists were suitably imperfect and a bit jaded, but they were basically decent and valued decency, on the odd chance they found it in others.In the case of Prayers for Rain, however, I'm not sure that the noir characterization fits.  In fact, that may be true for all the books in Lehane's Kensey and Gennaro series.  The main characters, Patrick Kensey and Angie Gennaro, are just too engaging and have too much fun.  Furthermore, while there's nothing sloppily sentimental about it, they really love each other.  Gennaro, especially, can be acerbic and hard-edged, but it's part of her playfulness, a bit brassy but clever and innocuous.  Just part of her fundamentally good-hearted personality.This odd couple of sometimes mis-matched private detectives and lovers, moreover, is especially adept at making interesting friends.  None are headed for sainthood, but they're the kind of folks you can count on, they've got your back, and are as resourceful as difficult circumstances demand.  In Prayers for Rain, Bubba Rogowski is exactly the kind of pal that Kensey and Gennaro need:  tough as nails, well-connected with the mob, violent, and about ten times as smart and skillful as he usually seems.  Bubba is exactly the sort we would expect to find in a noir atmosphere if he weren't such a true-blue, take-a-bullet-for-a-friend sort of guy.Great fun, true love, faithful comradeship, AND they all love dogs -- this is not the stuff of noir!  Still, there's enough nastiness, violence, back-stabbing, and double-dealing that Prayers for Rain comes close.  So I'll equivocate a bit and call it semi-noir.  However we label it, Lehane's novel is quite good.It's also long, well over three hundred pages, more than a hundred pages longer than The Drop.  In the case of Prayers for Rain, however, the extra length is all to the good.  The story is heavy-laden with interesting characters who interact in fascinating, sometimes hard-to-fathom ways, and the added pages assure that the characters are given the attention needed to enable us to understand them and their reasons for being there.  Motel owners Warren and Holly Martens are two of the most unexpected and charming minor characters readers will ever encounter.  Psychiatrist Diane Bourne is one of the most sinister.  And attorney Vanessa Moore is one of the sexiest.  Lehane's novel is full-to-the-brim with interesting people, and though they make his book long and not particularly stream-lined, they add substantially to its interest.Prayers for Rain is also quite complex.  So much happens that seems so unlikely that readers may judge it to be unrealistic, and it probably is.  However, Lehane is sufficiently skillful to prevent his story from becoming inaccessibly confusing, and he eventually manages to pull it all together into a coherent whole.  There are no dead zones or pointless sections that try the reader's patience, one of the difficulties with the second half of Live by Night.  Something eventful and pertinent is always happening, which may explain why the book is so long and complex.  Yes, long and complex but always readable and never boring.Early in the novel we also get to see what Kensey can do on his own, during a six month period when the couple has split.  He does well enough, but the book is a lot more interesting when the Kensey and Gennaro, haltingly at first, get back together.  Their animated effort to get more information out of Dr. Bourne is hilarious.  She sees through it, but given the circumstances, a performance as effectively choreographed as theirs has to  be unnerving.While there is plenty of fun and a big bundle of surprises in Prayers for Rain, there is also a good deal of compelling sadness, and a villain who is impossible not to hate.  Prayers for Rain has, by my count, three important substantive outcomes.  But however it ends, a novel fraught with more kinds of pain than a normal reader can imagine, will inevitably leave scars, as well as wounds that never heal.  Noir, neo-noir, semi-noir, whatever the literary characterization, this is a very good novel, probably the best of Lehane's early work, and I enjoyed reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTTO8ROUTSVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061998885#wasThisHelpful","RCTTO8ROUTSVF","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries give us high-quality noir from a Black man's point of view, and Black Betty may be the best novel in the Easy Rawlins series.  Inevitably, there are differences in plot and thematic emphasis when compared with traditional noir produced by White authors, but Mosley clearly appreciates the noir genre and keeps it pretty well intact.  Noir, whether produced by Mosley of any other capable author, say Dennis Lehane, is deeply cynical.  In a world fraught with corruption, duplicity, greed, vindictiveness, and violence, cynicism seems to be a rational response.However, as with noir pioneers such as Dashell Hammet, Raymond Chandler, and James Cain, Mosley's noir is replete with valuable gutter-level insights and the wisdom of the downtrodden that transforms it into something more than just entertainment.  In Mosley's work, genuinely useful lessons about life are typically manifest in his very skillfully developed characters and the ways they behave, think, and feel.  The noir protagonist himself, in this case Easy Rawlins, is a case in point.  Easy is no saint.  He couldn't be after coming up the brutally hard way as an orphaned Black child in a world dominated by Whites who, for the most part, regarded him dismissively, with contempt, and often as not unalloyed hatred.Nevertheless, Easy found favor with poor but nevertheless generous and loving people of his own race, and as a bright kid he grew into the sort of man that a fair-minded and decent person would respect.  Yes, the odds remained against him, his best friend was gratuitously homicidal, education-intensive white collar jobs were beyond his reach, and his wife left him taking their daughter.  But Easy had long-since learned to persevere, and in a modest, low-key way he prospered.Perhaps because of the lonely destitution of his childhood and the loss of his wife and daughter, Easy lovingly put together another family.  An Hispanic boy in his early teens and a Black toddler, cast-offs and orphans that Easy took in and made his own.  The value that Easy places on the innocence and love of two little kids puts him squarely in the tradition of the noir protagonist.  No, Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe didn't have children, and neither seemed interested in starting a family, but both men valued decency and people who were capable of unselfishly caring for others.  As with Easy, they were men to whom sentiment was not alien, but they were never duped into reveling in cheap and phony sentimentality.  Spade, Marlowe. and their kind were individualists and loners, but they understood friendship in a heart-felt, even if restrained sort of way.  Easy Rawlins fits very well into the category of noir protagonists.In Black Betty, as with Mosley's other novels, race is a conspicuous theme.  It's not as forcefully front and center as in Little Scarlet, but any novel set in the '50's or '60's with a Black protagonist and a predominately Black cast has to take race seriously.  Otherwise it's disingenuous trash.More than in his other novels, Mosley also recognizes the advantages and injustices of class, depending on one's position in this merciless hierarchy.  Poor Whites may have one less strike against them than poor Blacks, but Easy readily acknowledges that they struggle just as hard, and they, too, are demeaned and abused by the authorities and the wealthy.  No, poor Whites and poor Blacks are not allies by any means, but they share similarly difficult lives.Mosley is not afraid, moreover, to explain behavior, character traits, and overall world views in the terms of a social determinist.  He hasn't been intimidated by the favored chorus that sings the praises of individual responsibility as superseding all other factors.  Easy understands the obvious but much too often rejected notion that we are largely experiential products of our social context.  He doesn't use this insight to excuse harm that malefactors do to others, nor does it diminish the his appreciation of kindness, honesty, and a good heart.  However, he usually has a pretty good idea of how people got to be as they are, and he realizes that self-conscious decisions have less to do with it than many assume.  Life has taught Easy a lot about how the world works, enabling him to get by more intelligently, expecting neither too much nor too little of others, enabling him to do a pretty good job of avoiding betrayal and disappointment.The unexpectedly favorable development of Easy's relationship with a White lawyer named Saul Lynx is a nice tough that shows us how Mosley avoids stereotypes.  True to the noir tradition, an ordinary little guy who barely manages to stay afloat financially proves to be possessed of substantial courage, resourcefulness, and good will.  Just when we had him firmly pegged as nothing but a sleazy, small-time, marginally effective operator, Lynx, in a thoroughly believable sequence of events, turns out to be a force to be reckoned with on the side of virtue.Betty Eady, the woman who gives the novel its name, is a complex character whose deep blackness, in ironic contrast to aesthetic convention, contributes to her compelling beauty and sensuality.  Easy has known her, though not well, since he was a boy, long enough to see that her youthful brashness and sexuality were later more than matched by her mature love for her children and her self-sacrificing commitment to their safety.  Betty is a strong woman for whom the confluence of her overwhelming physical appeal with race and class costs her a great deal.  Much of Black Betty chronicles Easy's search for her at the behest of her employers, a dubious group who, for the most part, mean no one well.The ending of Mosley's novel takes awhile to unfold and is complex, culminating in a mixed outcome.  As the best of the Easy Rawlin's novels, Black Betty is loaded with interesting characters, and gives Easy an opportunity to show that while he is a caring and decent person, those who mistake him for a fool or a lightweight or overlook him entirely pay a suitable price.  Black Betty is a fine novel by any standard, and it can change the way we think about our world.  A powerful book that shows us noir at its best,","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14767HWHOMRHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743451783#wasThisHelpful","R14767HWHOMRHW","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy I was thrilled!  Just what we've long needed:  A science fiction hero who is also true to the noir genre!  It inspired me, for better or worse, to come up with the designation ""neo-noir,"" just to emphasize that this stuff is really futuristic.  Somehow I missed the second volume, but when my brother sent me a copy of the third, Hard Luck Hank:  Prince of Suck, I approached it with trepidation.  The first volume was so good that couldn't imagine Steven Campbell or anyone else maintaining that level of high quality entertainment for very longAs I started Prince of Suck, I said to myself, ""Yeah, I was right.  He's slipping badly.  Not much left in the tank.""  But it didn't take long for me to notice that I was chucking to myself while sitting alone, and sometimes laughing out loud.  It's a tough call, but the third volume in the Hard Luck Hank series may be even better than the first.  In any case, it's certainly different.Sure, there are some interesting parallels between the two, after all this is still Hank and he's still the story.  As before he'd rather negotiate than fight, but he's perfectly willing to kill if it seems like the sensible thing to do.  And he's tougher than the immensely tough and overwhelmingly strong guy that he was before.  In fact he's a lot tougher, a lot stronger, and, sad to say, a whole lot slower, in large part because his body weight has increased by several tons.  His oft repeated disclaimer, ""I don't do steps,"" is literally true.  In the first volume his bulk gave him a decided preference for elevators rather than stairways, but now he doesn't have much choice.  And even some elevators can't handle him.How did all this happen?  And why does it make me love the guy even more than I did the first time around?  While it's true that Hank has the extended longevity of a Mutant 4, even he is finally running out of time.  Hank is OLD!  Steven Campbell ingeniously contrived a rendering of that concept -- OLD -- to fit Hank, but in the abstract his account is really suggestive of what's happening to the rest of us who are getting old; it fits me better than I like to admit.  Getting bulky, slow, gradually losing some of our senses, such as taste and smell, becoming ham-handed and losing dexterity, developing an aversion to getting up in the morning or even getting up out of a chair ... I could go on, but you get the picture.The one thing conventional geriatrics don't share with Hank is getting tougher.  This guy has become practically invulnerable.  Not much of anything can hurt him, or even get his attention.  As if we needed added emphasis that Hank is almost impossible to move and physically insensitive, when one of his newly recruited female Kommilarie, a beautiful redhead with a galaxy-class body, stands in front of him and strips down to her boots, Hank seems not to notice!  Probably just as well.  A guy whose weight is best measured in tons could pose a real danger if aroused by a normally pneumatic woman.  Besides, once he's down, Hank has a tough time getting up.  Even his super strength is barely a match for his enormous weight.However, the one thing that will grab Hank's attention is a heart attack.  He has them more or less routinely.  They may put him out for a day or two, but then he somehow heals and gets going again, waiting for the one that will take him out for good.  Remember, though, this is the same guy who in the first volume twice spent a month in a coma after unfortunate misadventures first with a Dredl L robot, and then with a distant relative's antique pistol that exploded when he fired it.  A tough guy, yes, but even Hank has limits, including a finite life span.While in many ways -- strength, toughness, preference for negotiation over violence -- the Prince of Suck Hank has lot in common, even if in exaggerated form, with the Screw the Galaxy Hank, something truly fundamental has changed.  Hank, much like noir heroes we know, maybe Sam Spade, is now, more or less, on the side of the law.  In fact, in Belvaille Hank pretty much is the law.  He's the Supreme Kommilarie, commanding a contingent of four or five hundred lesser Kommilarie, whose job it is to maintain law and order, keep the peace, kill the worst of the worst or send them to the section of an orbiting prison known as the Royal Wing.  Being Supreme Kommilarie is a tough job:  his underlings are untrained and undisciplined; Belvaille is an ethnically charged tinder box; feral children run amok; nobody knows quite what's going on in the South End, just that it's good place to avoid; there are more criminal gangs and bosses than anyone can knowledgeably count; and to top it all off, Belvaille continues to have air, water and other absolute essentials only due to the efforts of an old, easily distracted genius named Delovoa, and at the sufferance of Garm, once the top security official and Hank's girlfriend, who somehow has come to own the City.Furthermore, as if more were needed, while it's the Kommilarie's job to enforce the law, there really is no law.  Hank tries to be evenhanded and reasonable in making it up as he goes along, and his long-celebrated negotiating skills are repeatedly put to the test.  Given that Hank's Kommilarie are vastly out-numbered by a multiplicity of bad guys and crazies, his ingenuity is tried beyond any sort of practical limits, and sometimes it's best just to let contending factions fight it out and kill each other off.Still, Hank has come to realize that he want's the best for Belvaille, wants it to be a decent place to live and raise children while earning a decent living.  He soldiers on with super-natural patience and the noir-like pragmatism of someone like Philip Marlowe, or Easy Rawlins.  Along the way he participates in the best parody of true-blue, cocksure, circular reasoning of free marketeers I've ever read.  Those Ank's are a caution!To sum it all up, Steven Campbell is at least as good as he ever was, and Hank is at least as engaging and funny.  A noir (or neo-noir) super hero for the ages.  I gotta get a copy of the volume I missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZD0ASPD2AWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502898535#wasThisHelpful","R3KZD0ASPD2AWJ","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raymond Williams was a brilliant and learned scholar from a Welsh working class background who devoted most of his professional life to making our shared world, in its myriad manifestations, understandable in an evolving Marxist context.  Williams, however, was not doctrinaire in his commitment to Marx, never imposing a nonsensically sanctified status on everything Marx wrote.  Nor, to my knowledge, did he side with those who saw a sharp distinction between the early Marx, ostensibly a humanistic philosopher, and the later Marx, a hard-nosed materialist scientist.When reading Marxism and Literature, it is easy to see that Williams based his presentation on material that Marx produced throughout his life, from the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 and the German Ideology through the Grundrisse, Capital, and Theories of Surplus Value.  As best I can determine, Williams regarded the work of the early Marx to be just as committed to materialism and the socially constituted nature of human beings, their language, culture, classes, and class relations as anything he wrote later.  The pattern of references in Marxism and Literature is clearly consistent with this judgment.Marxism and literature is a willfully condensed book, nearly devoid of examples to illustrate Williams' theoretical assertions, and it is quite dense.  The material itself is inherently difficult, and when offered with deliberate compactness and an aversion to all but the essentials, it becomes even more difficult.  For readers unfamiliar with much of anything Marx wrote, Marxism and Literature may prove to be inaccessible.  Even for those who have read substantial portions of Marx's writings, and who are familiar with related work, such as that offered by the Frankfurt School and the Althusserian structuralists, may find this book heavy going. Many of the concepts that are commonly used by Marxist students of literature are not due to Marx but to others who followed him. Thus, while Williams was an accomplished prose stylist, when he chose to make Marxism and Literature no more than half as long as it might easily have been, he demanded the reader's unwavering attention and thoughtful participation in the innately demanding social process of bringing his account to life.Much of Marxism and Literature is written in a point-counterpoint manner.  Williams introduces a crucial concept, say language, and then acknowledges others' rigorous scholarly efforts to come to terms with this idea, often finding favor with a Marxist audience.  While Williams is never acerbic nor given to shredding straw men, he then proceeds to explain the deficiencies in the work of others, and provides a more thoroughly Marxist alternative.Some of Williams' correctives are straightforward and easy to follow.  In the case of language, for example, which he discusses brilliantly and at length, he begins with the simple observation that language cannot be reduced to the status of a tool used by human beings to facilitate cooperative activity.  Instead, language is constitutive of human beings.  There are no human beings without language, and language is produced only by human beings.For readers new to Marxist literature, the use of the idea of production in this context is unlikely to be troublesome.  However, when Williams judges the production of language, as well as the creation of human beings, to be manifestations of material production, this usage may generate confusion for those unaccustomed to this way of thinking.  The notion of materialism in instances such as these refers to something that others have referred to as material practice.  Both human beings and the language constitutive of them are produced in social interaction.  They are products of ongoing social relationships, thereby giving priority to behavior occurring in specific social settings rather than to fixed ideas whose provenance is unsettled.Throughout Marxism and Literature, Williams returns again and again to the judgment that others fail to fully understand the social, the material, the productive, and the relational nature of the world in a suitably thoroughgoing way.  Invariably, however, Williams emphasizes that we must understand these processes in the historically specific social contexts in which they occur. Williams is a determinist but not a crude one.  He understands the importance of the manifold class-based and other variable contingencies in which determinism is present.While there is nothing really new about it, Williams treats Gramsci's concept of hegemony in the most compelling and informative way that I have read.  Many others have invoked hegemony in a variety of contexts and then left it as self-explanatory.  Perhaps it is, at least for those who have read Gramsci.  But I'm glad that Williams gave it a thoughtful rendering.  Nevertheless, as with other concepts, Williams admonishes us to avoid reification of hegemony.  It exists, yes, but only through production by active and material social relationships among human beings in a particular time and place.  A particular form of hegemony, moreover, contributes substantially to creating that time and place in ways that permit change and variability, rather than being crystallized and static.  An example of the latter sort of lifeless concept would be Zizek's ""social conscience"" as used in Living in the End Times.  In contrast to Zizek, as Williams matured, his Marxism became more sophisticated and more useful.Whatever its many virtues, Marxism and Literature can be annoying.  Williams' use of parentheses, sometimes containing an uncomfortably long line of words that cost us our train of thought, is excessive.  Furthermore, with or without parentheses, sentences that are longer than most paragraphs could easily have been avoided.  In addition, Williams' aversion to concreteness may make one suspect that while this is indeed a book about Marxism, the place of literature is, at best, ancillary.  This may be the primary limitation of William's fine book.Marxism and Literature is an instance of exemplary Marxist scholarship.  I think it also illustrates the ironic fact that things written by others, purportedly in a Marxist tradition, are commonly more difficult to understand than anything Marx himself ever wrote.  As such, it gives the reader a chance to decide if he or she is really interested in what pass for Marxist treatments of literature given the issues raised over the decades.  After all, it's entirely possible that one will find Marx or any other original thinker fascinating, but not be interested in what their adherents have to say about literature or any other practices commonly subsumed by the notion of the aesthetic.  As it turns out, that's where I find myself, something I never expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LDI69LBB3CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198760612#wasThisHelpful","R6LDI69LBB3CM","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Schmicker's clean, uncluttered, unpretentious prose style is ideally suited to writing a novel.  Though his off-beat and fascinating book The Witch of Napoli runs over three hundred pages and is thematically complex, it is also a quick and easy read.  His use of opposing ideas from the realms of the sacred and the secular, mystical and mundane, harmonious and conflictual, uplifting and scandalous, romantic and realistic could have easily devolved into an inaccessibly messy tale told by a tongue-tied idiot and of no interest to the reader.  Schmicker, however, writes in a disciplined and straightforward fashion that enables him to handle complicated and difficult material in a comfortably lucid manner.Though The Witch of Napoli is topically varied, the underlying story is fundamentally familiar:  the desperately poor, downtrodden, and thoroughly disadvantaged against the wealthy, aristocratic, and institutionally favored.  Schmicker gives these abstract factors concreteness in a context where the real attainments, as well as the new-found arrogance, of Late Nineteenth Century science are confronted by the mystical and inexplicable in the form of miracles performed by a semi-literate and deeply parochial Italian psychic and medium.One might readily conclude that such other-worldly phenomena had been discredited with sufficient frequency and decisiveness that they would not merit the attention of serious men of science.  However, there seems always to be a popular audience eager for mystical sensationalism, especially when the events in question have defied the best efforts of the most learned and accomplished to explain them in conventional physical terms.As presented by Schmicker, the antagonists in The Witch of Napoli might be taken as metaphors for conflicting classes:  the effectively disenfranchised and destitute on the side of tawdry mysticism, with those born to wealth, status, and institutional favor championing science.  Even the Catholic Church, at the direction of the Vatican, placed itself in the awkward position of supporting science and its devotees.  Evidently, the Church preferred maintaining its monopoly on all things remotely spiritual over the sacrilege of giving aid and comfort to people of the sort that celebrated the achievements of Charles Darwin.The antagonism between poverty and privilege, ordinary ignorance and scholarly attainment is emphasized by the humbly remote provenance, indecorous countenance, and sometimes vulgar simplicity of Alessandra Poverelli, the mystic to whom supernatural powers were attributed.  By sharp contrast, her arch-rival and brutally egotistical nemesis, Nigel Huxley, was a wealthy and well-born English gentleman, a product of his country's best schools and universities.  Huxley was the sort to whom well-bred decorum and patrician social niceties were second nature.  He was also vicious and vindictive, incapable of acknowledging the virtues and capabilities of a proletarian challenger to his position on much of anything, especially his judgment that the powers of psychics, mediums, and other mystics were instances of ignorance and charlatanism.Fittingly, the most intense and disturbing scenes in The Witch of Napoli are carefully orchestrated encounters pitting Alessandra against Huxley.  When all is said and done, however, it may be difficult to assign glorious victory or ignominious defeat to either combatant.  Much is lost, much is gained, and life goes on.Schmicker nicely avoids banal and tedious stereotypes when he portrays Alessandra as a woman a bit past her prime but possessed of mature beauty and innate charisma that turn the heads of many men far above her station.  That some of the most decent and admirable come to love her deeply, something she learns to reciprocate, provides a charming and believable antidote to the pain and conflict that suffuse much of the story.  The genuineness with which she revels in the role of Tante Alessandra is a tribute to her generosity of spirit and appreciation of real love when she is able to trust enough to let it through the barriers of scar tissue created by soul-breaking injuries inflicted throughout most of her life.The book's narrator, Tommaso Labella, though only a teen-aged journalist-aspirant just a few years and a few lucky breaks past being a Neapolitan street urchin, is Alessandra's companion and primary source of emotional support.  He responds to her in a quietly erotic way that he keeps to himself.  Rather than present Tommaso as existing in slavishly bewitched thralldom, however, Schmicker given him a good deal of latitude to be the teenager and budding reporter that he is.  Tommaso, in his way, loves Alessandra, but he also understands her limitations, though he rarely underestimates her character and strength.  His efforts to become a truly objective but ambitiously employable journalist sometimes cast him in the role of a mediator of the class conflict between Alessandra and Huxley.The Witch of Napoli is a very well written, thematically multi-dimensional, and unfailingly interesting novel.  Without question, it was produced by an accomplished professional who set out to entertain his audience, leavening his account with enough humor to make it palatable, and keenly attuned to the ambiguous and uncertain nature of our world.  It's not easy to persuade readers to cheer for rough-edged mystics over polished practitioners of institutionalized science, but for me Schmicker pulled it off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R225WHNAM58I53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990949028#wasThisHelpful","R225WHNAM58I53","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Raymond Chandler's novel Farewell My Lovely is the second of his books featuring private detective Philip Marlowe as the protagonist.  Farewell My Lovely is a first-rate read for fans of noir fiction who don't mind working through a story that seems a bit more complex than necessary.  As with his first novel, The Big Sleep, Chandler manages to tie everything together at the very end, but the last thirty or so pages seem pretty cluttered.  This is a very good book might that have been even better if Chandler hadn't introduced so many ancillary themes with so much detail.  Still, cluttered or not, none of the ideas that contribute to making Farewell My Lovely a complex whole are lacking in interest or originality.  Moreover, this is the sort of fiction that leaves the reader with a sense that he or she understands the world a little better for having read it.  Chandler was a careful and insightful observer of everyday life, and therefore so is Philip Marlowe.Readers familiar with The Big Sleep, however, may conclude that over the course of a year or so Marlowe has lost some of his linguistic sophistication and become a bit more flinty, hard-edged, and off-handedly glib.  He still values character, civility, and decency when he finds them, and from time to time he's still unexpectedly sentimental.  Nevertheless, it seems as if the time that passed between Chandler's first and second novels has made Marlowe more cynical and less likely to regard the feelings of others with at least a modicum of sympathy.  Marlowe seems to have become more world-weary, and he's certainly accumulated a lot of beatings, both physical and psychological.  Truth be told, one wonders how a guy can take so much punishment and keep coming back for more.  Perhaps one of the few deficiencies of Chandler's fiction as manifest in Farewell My Lovely and his other novels is that no one can survive as much abuse as Marlowe, bouncing right back after a good night's sleep and a substantial breakfast.Marlowe is a good looking guy in hie early thirties, a sharp dresser who fills out his clothes nicely, and women like him.  It's hard to escape the impression, however, that he works so hard at making a modest living the it's unlikely that he often has a really good time.  That may be one reason why he drinks so much.  I don't think that Chandler wanted his readers to suspect that Marlowe was a drunk, but he's got a thirst for booze that rarely seems to be completely quenched.  Maybe that's just a trait that Marlowe shares with other noir protagonists, guys like Dashell Hammett's Sam Spade.  Booze is one of the incidental but distinctive elements of the noir environment.  Still, the brutal life Marlowe lives and the alcohol that may be his one ever-present and reliable pleasure may prompt readers to ask the same question that some of Chandler's lesser characters often put to Marlowe:  why doesn't he get into a less damaging and more lucrative line of work?  Marlowe never gives a satisfactory answer.Younger readers may be troubled by the way racial and ethnic minorities and gay people are talked about and treated in the world inhabited by Marlowe.  But Farewell My Lovely was first published the year before the U.S. entered World War II.  Even the military was segregated.  The word ""gay"" had not yet acquired meaning with regard to sexual orientation, and abortion was almost unthinkably immoral.  None of this makes the book outmoded or obsolete, however, unless history and its interpretation are also outmoded and obsolete.  Social and cultural anachronisms, however objectionable, were constituents of Marlowe's commonsense environment, things with which he had to deal.To Marlowe's credit, he was one of the few who noted the obvious injustice in institutional recognition of crimes against whites contrasted with failure to acknowledge the equally serious consequences of crimes against blacks.  Marlowe was a product of his time, but he was able to see the hypocrisy and inequity to which most were blind.  Perhaps his understanding of the injuries inflicted on members of devalued groups contributed to his cynicism.  It's good that he was still able to see the merit in, and maybe even feel some affection for folks like the Belvedere City detective he nicknamed ""Hemingway.""  Marlowe had not yet been robbed of his ability to appreciate well-meaning, basically honest plodders.I think The Big Sleep is a little better than its sequel, but Farewell My Lovely is still a five-star novel.  Chandler was not perfect, but he's original and writes quite well.  And Philip Marlowe is still a quintessential noir protagonist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBMJQCXEZGR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394758277#wasThisHelpful","RTBMJQCXEZGR5","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raymond Chandler's novel The Big Sleep is anything but.  With prototypical noir private detective Philip Marlowe as the protagonist, Chandler's novel grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go until the very end.  Yeah, we're all headed for the big sleep soon enough, and nobody knows that better than Marlowe.  He moves in circles where death comes early to a lot of folks, both good and bad.Marlowe sees the underside of life at its ugliest and most dangerous, but somehow he manages to avoid becoming a mean-spirited cynic.  He's got a cynical streak, sure, but there's a lot more to him than just cold, dark skepticism, doubt, and mistrust.  Almost in spite of himself, Marlowe is the kind of guy who, though he's hard as nails, cares about cadaverous old men whose basic decency is belied by wayward adult children, spoiled by excessive wealth and unnaturally nasty to those who refuse to give them exactly what they want.Marlowe, in fact, cares about a lot of people that we'd expect a hard-boiled private eye to dismiss as the products of bad choices, mishandled opportunities, and not worth the trouble.  He's a tough guy, a sharp dresser, attractive to women, smart and street-wise, but he's not arrogant.  Confident, sure, but not a showboat or the sort of person who takes advantage of others who are impressed by his reputation and desperately need his services.Chandler doesn't tell us much about Marlowe's background.  He once worked as an investigator for the Los Angeles County District Attorney, but that's pretty much it.  I think we can infer from what we read that Marlowe went private because he didn't want to be constrained by excessive rules and regulations as to how investigations were to be done.  He's got a good head for his line of work, so why let himself be hamstrung by red tape and undercut by the political connections of the rich and famous?One thing Marlow might have done but systematically avoided was using his skills and reputation in amoral pursuit of big money.  Instead, he charges a modest daily fee plus expenses, and this is a guy who lives in a small apartment with a bed that pulls out of the wall.  He could have gotten a lot more, but he's comfortable, well put together, with suitable transportation, money for decent restaurants, and he doesn't miss not having a secretary.  Modest and frugal almost to a fault, but he doesn't do without anything he really needs.  Besides, there is substantial gratification in having the admiration, even when grudging, of high officials in what we now euphemistically call the criminal justice system.One of the things that is especially interesting about Marlowe, complete with his unexplored background. is the fact that he's not just another semi-articulate gumshoe.  His thinking has the complexity and sophistication of a genuinely literate and polished operative.  When he characterizes a story he's been told during the course of an investigation as ""... a little pat.  It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled web of fact,"" it becomes clear that he's not the sort who is at a loss for linguistic concepts that enable him to think things through unhampered by lack of wit and learning.  The guy is smart, savvy, and well-suited for the complex intellectual labor that comes with his job.Marlowe likes the ladies, and they, for the most part, like him.  However, even when he's in a circumstance to pick an choose, he puts the job first, not compromising his position by succumbing to temptation.At the end of The Big Sleep, Marlowe mourns the loss of a woman he found especially appealing with a couple of stiff drinks.  Sadly the scotch just makes things worse, but he takes what comfort he can in having enabled a dying old man to salvage his pride.Marlowe is a street-level philosopher who is keenly aware that eventually everyone ""just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell.""  He didn't kid himself:  he is part of the nastiness, as are all the best  noir protagonists.  But like he said, so what?  When you're dead, you're dead.The Big Sleep is a pretty complex novel with some interesting, likable, loathsome, and indifferent characters.  The best part of Chandler's book, however, is Philip Marlowe:  the quintessential noir protagonist. Marlowe is a great character, and The Big Sleep is a fittingly titled first-rate read, complete with dated references to what we then called ""smut.""  How tame when compared to today's porno!I really enjoyed reading The Big Sleep, and others will, too.  The story is detailed and plain-spoken enough to be realistic, but the main attraction and primary source of interest if Philip Marlowe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38XSYN6SPC9AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612428185#wasThisHelpful","R38XSYN6SPC9AC","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early in Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness, its protagonist and narrator, Marlow, muses on the conquests of the ancient Romans and compares their worth to the colonial empires of his time.  The Romans, he opines, relied on brute force to achieve their expansionist aims, thereby diminishing the potential value of the conquered lands, giving the victors only a tenuous hold, and diminishing opportunities for exploitation.  Modern colonialism, by contrast, imposed efficient organization, systematically administered for long-term possession of the conquered territory and organized in ways that sure-handedly pumped value from the colonies to the homeland.  Marlow succinctly used fewer words, but the forgoing spells out his meaning.But the story Marlow was telling referred to properly modernized administration of colonies only very briefly, in passing, in a way that was very easy to miss or simply pass over as of no consequence.  After all, as the Heart of Darkness develops, it becomes abundantly clear that its focus is on a man named Kurz, an agent of British commercial interests, the most successful procurer of ivory to be shipped back to England and transformed into enormous profits.Kurz has acquired the status of a mythical hero, a man seldom seen but often said to be a universal genius, perhaps the most articulate and knowledgeable orator on the African continent.  One wonders what his eloquence has to do with procuring ivory, but Kurz's vocal prowess is rumored to have risen to the level of a compelling instrument of persuasion that captivated others, convinced them that his interests were theirs, that he deserved unquestioning devotion in exchange for the wisdom he imparted, and he did this even in dialects known to few Europeans.  Kurz is a charismatic figure who had mastered the undocumented mysteries of leadership and was at home in the densest, darkest, most forbidding jungles, where he sometimes moved alone for long periods.Kurz was not simply a fortune hunter and representative of Western commercial interests. He had become a non-religious missionary, a prophet of modernity in unexploited lands among a population resistant to the imposition of alien economic practices and their organizational and technological manifestations.  Kurz was an agent of Marlow's efficient administration and profitable organization of the captive colonies of modernizing Europe.However, even in the early 1900's, doubts had begun to surface as to the unqualified virtues of modern civilization and its unquestioned superiority to traditional societies.  The unanticipated loss of a sense of community, the demise of a feeling of shared belonging, and the troubling dissipation of a culture constituted of a common set of values, standards, and legitimated ways of doing things painfully introduced what recent writers have characterized as a homeless mind.Conrad wrote the Heart of Darkness just a few years after the French sociologist Emile Durkheim first used the concepts anomie, or cultural deregulation, end egoism, or social rootlessness, both giving rise to a variety of forms of social pathology, such as anxiety, depression, suicide, and homicide.  Durkheim was among the first to call attention to the unacknowledged costs of modernization and large-scale development of technology-intensive social systems.  Soon, however, the uncertainty, isolation, superficiality, and ambiguity of modern society were the stuff of some of the finest fiction of the 20th Century, produced by Modernist authors such as Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, and others of comparable stature.Seen in light of emerging doubts as to the neutral benevolence of modernity, Conrad's Kurz may best be understood as one who came to the heart of an Africa that was still untouched by modern civilization and began using his hypnotic eloquence to persuade indigenous people to give way to the demands of modern efficiency and profitability.  However, as he became increasingly aware of the little-understood virtues of traditional people and their way of life, contrasted with the destructive strains inherent in modernization, he struggled, became torn, faltering, spiritually vague, and deeply uncertain.  He still had his gifts, but he realized that the heart of darkness need not be in the African jungles, but might very well be in the heartlessness of modern society.  No wonder the indigenous population was terrified when Marlow sounded the steam whistle on his boat.  It was just the sort of ugly screech that marked the changing of shifts at a modern factory or mine.  Marx himself acknowledged that steam power was the essential force in large-scale modernization.Hearkening back to Marlow's seemingly innocuous reference to the virtue of efficient administration, Conrad gives us Kurz as one no longer convinced that the payoffs of modernity are worth the costs, but he sees that it may be inevitable.  The prospect of heartlessness is a heavy load to bear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY4QWKBP7T0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486264645#wasThisHelpful","RGY4QWKBP7T0W","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got drafted into the Army in 1965 and served two years of active duty.  I lucked out, however, and didn't get sent to Viet Nam.  I doubt that I realized how fortunate I had been until I visited the Viet Nam Veterans' Memorial in D.C.  More than 58,000 names of soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen who had been killed in a pointless war of choice fostered by ""the best and the brightest"" chicken hawks occupying the highest levels of the U.S. government.The fact that I never saw combat and thought the war was an atrocity are two reasons among many that make Tim O'Brien's book The Things They Carried difficult to evaluate.  I think there is merit to his claim that fictionalized accounts can sometimes make important points with greater impact and truer feeling than straightforward reporting.  But it takes an enormously talented and disciplined writer with an abundance of personal experience to make it work, the sort of author whose best output calls into question the truism that ""a picture is worth a thousand words.""In the first few sections of his book, I think that O'Brien manages to pull it off.  I was especially impressed with the very personal ""On the Rainy River,"" that bore what I took to be truthful and moving testimony to the struggles that many experienced when trying to decide how to respond to a draft notice.  I was too poor, disconnected, and mixed up to have considered going to Canada, but I remember staying awake the night before I reported, trying to convince myself that the so-called domino theory had undeniable merit, and concluding that the loss of South Viet Nam would ultimately be of greatest benefit to the expansionist aims of what we then called Red China.At least in my case, moreover, O'Brien's conclusion that the driving forces of embarrassment and shame could have been decisive in making my decision seems right on target.  At the time, being drafted was something that had happened to so many of the people I knew, grandfather, father, uncles nephews, cousins, and friends.  Not going was not a realistic option, but that didn't mean i didn't struggle with the decision, and almost decided to go AWOL my first day in the Army's reception center for new recruits and draftees.I was also struck my the author's descriptions of death:  instantaneous, mutilating, and ugly, something that prompted those still living to play head games with themselves to deal with it.  I thought O'Brien's account of his response to his first kill, the slender and well-favored young man whose face was destroyed by a fragmentation grenade, was overdone.  But then I caught myself and asked ""who am I to make that judgment?""  Briefly, in other words, I had forgotten that I was reading fiction, a literary rendering of a dramatically condensed version of what really happened, an account intended to give us keener insight and deeper feeling than a purely descriptive report of events as they actually occurred.I began to read The Things They Carried more critically, and while I was still favorably impressed, I also had doubts about the claim that O'Brien's fiction was as powerful as he intended.  As the book took a mystical turn and rocks and trees were given life in the form of the production of music, both indigenous and widely varied western forms, I began to have trouble understanding what the author was trying to do.  I can imagine that troops in the bush, acutely aware of the hidden death that could be surrounding them, ready to strike at any moment, would be so hyper-vigilant that they would see and hear traces of things that might not be there.  After all, each of us contributes something of ourselves to what we sense and know.  But as far as I can tell, the author seemed to have something else in mind.  And with the arrival of Mark Fossie's seventeen year old girl friend, fiction began to turn into fantasy, and O'Brien's intentions became even more obscure.Once the girl was there, however, I suppose we can accept her remarkably rapid adjustment to that forbidding and dangerous place, and her willingness and ability to take on the duties of an Army medic.  However, when she joins a nearby Special Forces unit and becomes deeply involved in the mysteries of late-night patrols for purposes that are not revealed, the author's message becomes hopelessly muddled.  It's as if she had found something sacred, or at the very least a good deal more solid and real in this totally alien place than elsewhere.  Perhaps this is meant to suggest the mystical quality  that a thoroughly unfamiliar setting is granted by those put down in the middle of it.  Whatever the explanation, I think it has the unintended consequence of trivializing war as experienced by regular soldiers.A minor point, I suppose, but one day I hope writers and reporters will stop attributing super-human powers to the Special Forces, Navy Seals, and other special operations groups.  I recently heard a former member of the Russian Spetsnaz characterize them as specialists rather than soldiers.  By reflexively assuming preternatural capabilities of a handful of specialists, we diminish the real battle-tested prowess of regular soldiers, the people who actually fight wars and do so with skill, strength, and courage.The Things They Carried is by no means a bad book, and I'm sure Tim O'Brien has plenty of talent to spare.  Still, while his book offers keen insights and there are instances where it approximates the author's objective of using fiction to better represent reality, all things considered it was a bit disappointing.  I don't regret reading it, but perhaps more than most novels, it's best read critically, and with the knowledge that there are as many compelling Viet Nam War stories as there are Viet Nam War veterans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCIF86VDF3MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZGC2XE#wasThisHelpful","R3MCIF86VDF3MC","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon is well written, easy to read, without an unduly large number of names and locations that the reader has to remember to follow the story line.  While Harris' book is not gratuitously violent or artificially sensational, the violent crimes committed are described in vivid detail, including unique and unexpected findings that tend to insidiously get under one's skin.  Even before I knew the story of the Red Dragon himself, I was feeling a bit uneasy.  I was unnerved by the graphically depicted horror of the crimes themselves, yes, but even more frightening was the simple fact that such monstrous events could occur just about anywhere to just about anyone.  It shouldn't be that easy to slaughter families, but Harris makes clear that in his world it is.  People living in upper middle class neighborhoods with upper middle class resources who, in spite of their attainments, turn out to be defenseless when confronted with a ruthless and determined predator.Harris is not inclined to devote a lot of attention to character development.  We know enough about the protagonist, Will Graham, and his family to understand how difficult it is for all of them when the FBI calls him out of retirement to help them with the Red Dragon killings.  Graham has demonstrated his uniquely insightful ability to get inside the heads of serial killers in the past, and while his effort have been invaluable, they have also taken a heavy toll on him, his wife, and his stepson.  Graham now lives a comfortable life doing a man's work and enjoying his family in an almost idyllic setting.  The reader can decide for him or herself, but if I had been Graham I wouldn't have risked it all by going back, even temporarily, to the kind of work that had once proven so costly and could very well do so again.  Beyond that, however, we don't know much about Graham, but what we've got seems to be enough.  The only thing missing is whatever it is that motivates him to take such dangerous risks, especially when his family is understandably opposed.Whatever the author's inclinations regarding character development in general, his treatment of the background and all the unhappy, sometimes hideous, factors that went into the development of the Red Dragon is exemplary, genuinely persuasive in its detailed explanation of the creation of a monster.  Some readers may judge that Harris has told us more about the life course of Francis Dolarhyde than we really need to know, but I think that understanding someone as complex, vicious, and ultimately delusional as the Red Dragon merits no less than what Harris has judiciously given us.  Once we've read the author's account of Dolarhyde's history, his transformation into someone as abnormally brutal and psychologically deformed as the Red Dragon seems almost a foregone conclusion.  Becoming the Red Dragon was a way for him to survive while bearing the wounds and crippling limitations inflicted on him since birth.  If this torturous process didn't work out, it was as much a matter happenstance in a world of undetected traps and unforeseen opportunities as anything else.  Otherwise, given Dolarhyde's perverted but estimable intelligence and steely determination, he might have gone on as the Red Dragon indefinitely.Just as the crimes he committed, Francis Dolarhyde's Red Dragon will get under the reader's skin.  The thought that there are inevitably others who were formed much as he was is really quite sad and certainly frightening.  The author's originality in in documenting the life of Francis Dolarhyde is impressively original and makes for fascinating reading.  Dolarhyde's visits to the St. Louis Zoo and the Brooklyn Museum are especially interesting and skillfully rendered.Readers who have acquired an intense interest in Hannibal Lector may be disappointed that he is not given more attention.  However, he plays an important role, plays it well, and giving him more coverage would be mistake.  In this instance, a little bit of Lector goes a long way.While Red Dragon is well written by a seasoned professional who knows how to get the reader's attention and hold it, there were times when my attention briefly flagged and I thought the author was trying too hard to make his novel convincing and realistic.  Still, while Red Dragon may not be a perfect book, it is very entertaining, and Harris skillfully avoids sentimentality in all the places where lapsing into that mood must have been very tempting.  A good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9BIKN237VRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027G8SI6#wasThisHelpful","R2J9BIKN237VRG","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Power and the Glory is a beautifully written novel produced by a master prose stylist who knows that profound insights, eternal truths, and the ambivalent nature of our moral world are best rendered accessibly, in ways that all readers can readily follow.  First published in 1940, Graham Greene's novel pits the justice sought by the Mexican Revolution against the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church.The Church was and remains a conservative force in the Third World and elsewhere, it's typically unspoken alliances with the forces of reactionary repression and exploitation guarantee its continued existence and largely unchallenged influence regarding political issues that can be reckoned in religious terms.  Oft-made decisions to leave worldly matters of justice, fairness, and equity to the profane political realm defined by differences in material and social power serve the status quo well.  In the meantime, the Church nominally restricts itself to the search for eternal salvation through fostering adherence to narrowly construed religious strictures governing personal morality, and the Church is rewarded accordingly.  Who knows, perhaps the Iron Curtain would still be standing if the nations of the Soviet Union had sought an accommodation with the Church.  After all, there is nothing new about ideologically contradictory alliances in pursuit of mutual survival.The Power and the Glory is set in the 1930's, during the long-running Mexican Revolution.  Led by Madero, Villa, Zapata and other still-revered revolutionary heroes, this was an uprising of the Left.  Its proponents were irrepressibly hostile to the traditional paternalistic and grossly inequitable organization of Mexican society. They sought equity and self-determination in the material world, a place of unspeakable poverty and suffering for all but the privileged few, priests and higher Church officials among them.As a result, the revolutionaries sought to abolish religious teachings and practices.  Their efforts were sometimes clumsy and of dubious value, for example requiring that all who had been priests get married, and making wine and other alcoholic beverages illegal.  So much for communion wine.  In addition, however, the Revolution was seeking to eliminate the dissolution and chemically engendered escapism that made many Mexicans unreliable compatriots.As portrayed in The Power and the Glory, the material aims of the Revolution were not even crudely approximated.  Too many of those who ostensibly served the Revolution did so in a perfunctory and self-serving way.  High officials in the military and the national police  were ineffectual, indifferent, and simply corrupt.A conspicuous exception was the young Lieutenant in Las Casas whose spit-and-polish military demeanor betokened a powerful commitment to the Revolution and its aims.  The Lieutenant's hostility to the Church was as strong as one would expect of a politically astute indigenous Mexican of Indian heritage who came of age during a time when the social and cultural wherewithal of Catholicism were in the service of the wealthy elite, completely ignoring the plight of the poor.  The Lieutenant was also, however, a man of intelligence and good judgment who understood that even his nemesis, the so-called Whiskey Priest, was not without inoffensive qualities and posed no real threat to the Revolution.Greene's protagonist, the otherwise unnamed Whiskey Priest, personified the evils of a religious denomination that was protected by the state.  In a perhaps exaggerated form, the Whiskey Priest represented the Catholic Church as the revolutionaries understood it:  corrupt, exploitative, hypocritical, and an enemy of the Mexican people.  The most interesting and wonderfully insightful struggle in Greene's treatment of these revolutionary times occurs within the mind, heart, and soul of the Whiskey Priest.Yes, he is guilty of the sins attributed to him and still more.  As a priest he was no danger to the reactionary regime served by the Church, but he also failed to meet the modestly comforting, even if ultimately self-deceiving, spiritual needs of his parishioners.  He had no political agenda, but he had gluttony, drunkenness, and sloth, and he fathered a daughter in a brief, almost accidental and seemingly passionless departure from celibacy with a peasant woman.Ironically, however, it is the priest's encounters with ordinary people living in poverty and without prospects that manifests his destiny.  As a priest, he has an obligation to love all members of the human race deeply, spiritually, and uniformly in a contemporary emulation of Christ himself.  However, the Whiskey Priest, as he seeks to recover his lost decency and come to terms with his vocation, realizes that he can never love anyone as much as he loves his illegitimate daughter.  Though she despises him and taunts him mercilessly, the child's welfare and happiness are of greater concern to him than anyone or anything else.For most of us, this would be readily understandable:  we love our children above all others.  But for a man trying to return to priestly righteousness, this is selfish and worldly, cause for continuing anguish.Similarly, being hunted by the police for what he is and for minor offenses such as possession of brandy, he spends a night in a crowded and unimaginably filthy Mexican jail.  In spite of the filth, stench, and undisguised carnality of the place, he feels comradeship with the other prisoners, whether they be murderers, rapists, petty offenders, or prisoners-by-mistake.  They are genuine, needful, and hostile in honest ways.  A sharp contrast to the ostentatious piety, the sterile and indifferent sanctimoniousness of officials of the Church.That the Church is corrupt and corrupting becomes unmistakably clear when, after he is released and seeks refuge in the north, he is asked to briefly adopt the role of a priest once again.  Almost immediately the false piety and unquestionable sense of moral rectitude return.  He again, for a day, becomes a personification of the bastion of false conservatism and ally of political reaction that was his Catholic Church.The Power and the Glory is a brilliant novel that raises questions and offers insights not to be found elsewhere.  Whatever his failings, the struggle of the Whiskey Priest with himself is powerfully instructive, and he is one of the most interesting protagonists to be found in 20th Century literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18U2UICUEGHGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=999471564X#wasThisHelpful","R18U2UICUEGHGC","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nathaniel West's novel The Day of the Locust is extraordinarily powerful, a deeply troubling depiction of life in the United States and perhaps much of the world.  Initially, I found it difficult to decide if West's uncomplicated but blinding insights pertained just to the U.S. in the late 1930's, or if they were better interpreted as a commentary on the human condition.  However, whatever the book's degree of universality at the time it was first published, as the decades have passed and globalization has proceeded, The Day of the Locust seems more and more applicable to an abundance of people who live in America and far beyond our borders.West's prose style is neither complex nor otherwise difficult.  He writes in a direct, straightforward way and does so brilliantly.  His ability to enable us to see the people, places, and events he addressed is unsurpassed in my experience.  As I read his brief novel, I began to realize that West permits us to do more than follow a narrative and understand a story, but to visualize it as well.  Thanks to West's skill with the written word, I am confident that I know what Faye Greener looks like at her most sultry and her most pathetic.  I can see her father as his health fails and he dies.  Tod, Homer, Earle, Miguel, and the others are palpably real people, distinctive, living configurations in my mind's eye.Someone less skillful than West could easily convince us of the ugly brutality of cockfighting as it occurred in a make-shift fighting pit arranged in an unexceptional lower-middle class garage.  But only a rare and remarkably gifted writer could present it in a way that forced the violence of the fight on the reader in an almost viscerally painful way.  Only a rare and remarkably gifted writer could enable us to see the badly over-matched red bird as its dead head flopped loosely and pathetically to one side while its opponent picked at the eye that was still intact.Using Hollywood as a metaphor for the rest of the U.S. and perhaps the world, enabled West to use a place of fantasy, fraud, and cultural propaganda to vividly display the fact that confused, troubled, and unfulfilled lives, for most of us, are the norm.  To search for more by responding to the phony promises of California, or working harder, or being a paragon of virtue, or otherwise exerting one's self to attain a modicum of happiness will almost certainly bring disappointment.Tod's attempt to locate Faye, the effort that leads him through cardboard Parthenon's and contingents of soldiers wearing armor fashioned with construction paper very effectively illustrates the lack of substance in the world of glamour and excitement that we sometime seek.  The fact that Tod, a studio artist, had designed some of these special effects is especially telling.  To a greater or lesser degree, with greater or lesser effectiveness, we are all complicit in the cheap and tawdry process of deluding ourselves, striving for the conviction that whole, substantial, and fulfilling lives can be ours.  But how could it be otherwise.  We're all born into a world of worthless mystifications and sterile bromides, taught to think using self-deceiving catch-phrases and meaningless cliches.  The only cognitive tools we have to make sense of the world are already part and parcel of its delusional ambience.One might imagine that this treacherous and painful set of circumstances could give rise to an organized revolutionary effort to take back the promise of a decent life.  But we don't have the intellectual and affective equipment, and besides, it would be treasonous.  We see the lack of self-fulfilling wherewithal and the inability to fend off damaging social arrangements and cruel cultural artifacts with heart-rending, but also pathetically annoying clarity in Homer.  His hopeless loneliness, profoundly injurious vulnerability, and complete lack of effectiveness present in brutally concentrated form the shared human condition as West understood it.  This is not the stuff of which revolutions are made.  Instead, it eventually gives rise to noxious well-springs of bitterness and resentment, better suited to creating a lynch mob than an organized cell of subversives.The Day of the Locust is the sort of book that takes a toll on the reader.  Whether or not we see ourselves in its pages, the disappointment, desolation, and despair in which it finds it characters is awful to behold.  Nathaniel West's death at age thirty-six cost American literature and our cultural character a great deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6Q8D5BPMWYRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604443561#wasThisHelpful","R6Q8D5BPMWYRR","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quentin, the protagonist in Arthur Miller's play After the Fall, is a successful attorney with accomplished friends and colleagues who is sufficiently attractive to women that he has fewer affairs than he could have if he were interested in attaining the status of a sophisticated urban rake.  Much to his discomfort, however, Quentin's life is heavy-laden with moral quandaries that lie heavily on his conscience.  Some of his internal struggle is of his own making.  After all, he did have an affair, promised his wife, Louise, that he'd break it off, but reneged on their agreement.Understandably, Louise is resentful, and restoring trust is always difficult and sometimes impossible.  Because of Quentin's betrayal and her disappointment, she has concluded that he does not love her, doesn't take her seriously, and that he discounts her importance as a distinctively interesting person.  One suspects that Louise imagines, probably with good reason, that Quentin had long since ceased to regard her as someone of value, easy to ignore, not quite a whole and feeling human being.Beyond that, After the Fall is set in the 1950's. Quentin and his friends, prominent and successful as they are, have been forced into the ranks of the victims of anti-communist hysteria fostered by self-seeking,reactionary politicians.  They have been called before Congressional committees to answer for what may have been membership and participation in subversive organizations.  None is completely guilty, but none is, in a strict sense, completely innocent either.  They have been idealists, perhaps inexcusably naive, who wittingly and unwittingly served the interests of America's enemies.  Ironically, their primary protection from adverse consequences is the U.S. Constitution, specifically the First and Fifth Amendments.As time passes, however, and the pressure builds, the solidarity among members of the group diminishes.  Some, including the tough and decisive Mickey, agree to testify openly and, as they put it, to ""name names.""Another of their number, Lou, a successful academic under siege at his university, can find only one lawyer, and one friend, namely Quentin, to defend him.  When Lou buckles under the stress and commits suicide, Quentin is secretly relieved.  This troubles him.  After all, he and Lou were good friends of long standing, and Quentin feels a sort of survivor's guilt, knowing that Lou's death relieves him of the damaging suspicion that he is a traitor defending a traitor.Quentin's relationship with Lou had become immensely more difficult when Lou admitted that he had written a well known book in which he had lied about law and the legal system in the Soviet Union.  He did so because he had not yet given up on Communism, and subsequently he was afraid to publish a truthful book, thereby revealing his past political indiscretions.In a sense, this episode typifies the kind of moral complications that beset Quentin's life.  The investigating Committee was composed of hypocrites, bullies, and liars.  The friend he had been willing to help was weak, ambivalent, and not without blame.  His other friends were of little value, too concerned with their own prospects to be reliably courageous.  Just what was the right thing to do, and just what was the upstanding way to feel?  No easy answers, and perhaps no answers at all.For Quentin, power took two forms.  One, understandably, was the ability to ignore the demands of his over-burdened, guilt-ridden conscience.  The other was through his personal presence and demeanor as they produced real change in others.  Insofar as Quentin had any power at all, he seems to have been much more effective at wielding the latter form.  When he first met Maggie, for example, his unexceptional but genuine efforts to help her yielded, as she later tells it, a transformation, enabling her to take herself seriously and confidently pursue what seemed to be her own best interests as a self-aware and talented person.When they get together four years later, however, Maggie eventually makes it abundantly clear that the love of one person for a badly damaged other is not enough.  Quentin makes extraordinarily selfish mistakes, to be sure, but the quasi-domestic maelstrom of conflicting feelings and harrowing events seem worse than his failings deserve.Quentin, Maggie, Louise, Lou, Mickey and all the others whose lives are beset with guilt, turmoil, disappointment, and real danger seem to be the products of a world where durable standards and lasting relationships are not to be found.  Right and wrong seem hopelessly confounded and confused, and the cultural basis for establishing and maintaining satisfying and reliable ties among people has been lost.  That life is a struggle, thus, should come as no surprise.Given that it's widely recognized that After the Fall is autobiographical, with Quentin representing playwright Arthur Miller and Maggie representing his wife-for-a-time, Marilyn Monroe, it's easy, and, in good part, correct to imagine that their chaotic lives and circumstances have little to do with the rest of us.  Nevertheless, we all share a socially complicated and uncertain world beset with cultural thinness.  As a result, for us, too, it should come as no surprise that life is a struggle.I think that After the Fall is a badly flawed play, complete with three elevated levels of staging that permit introduction of images that are of no value and may be pointless distractions.  Furthermore, Arthur Miller's portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, even if perfectly accurate, is a betrayal of trust and, in that sense, obscene.  Alive or dead, we all deserve better.  Still, After the Fall is a play worth reading, especially now that the sensationalism surrounding it is long past.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5X2PFS20BBEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140481621#wasThisHelpful","R5X2PFS20BBEP","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite modernist novelist is Virginia Woolf.  Reading and re-reading her best known books, Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse, has taught me how to approach this genre, identifying distinctive themes and formulating reasonable and satisfying interpretations.When Virginia Woolf, in her own beautiful prose, employs her characters to unself-consciously manufacture social reality, they do so using the tools available at the time:  a composite of social conventions and cultural artifacts that are innately transitory, though they feel undeniably timeless and unmistakably real.  She proceeds in a way that is discernible to careful readers but doesn't smash it in their faces.  There is no doubt that life is inherently meaningless, interpretable only through the meanings that her characters create in ways that are taken for granted and only very subtly evident.We also see the effects of the catastrophe that was World War I, and the technology-intensive, rapid transformation of social relations that accompanied and followed the War.  In time, the world of culturally shared meanings becomes quite different from traditional beliefs and practices.  Still socially constructed and mutable, they constitute a new reality, as seemingly reliable and true as that which came before, an epistemological transformation of commonsense that Woolf captures with elegance and insight.It would be foolish and perversely doctrinaire to expect Hemingway's modernist fiction, as manifest in The Sun Also Rises, to mimic the work of Virginia Woolf.  However, while she manages to deal with modernist themes and issues with remarkable literary skill, Hemingway, sadly, can't seem to pull it off.  His ostensibly lean and masculine prose too often strikes me as just plodding indifference.  Maybe even a lazy caricature of himself.The themes of modernism are there, more or less, but they exhibit themselves with uncaring decadence and dramatized brutality.  With occasional ancillary exceptions, the characters are vulgarly obvious aesthetes, frenetic seekers of meaning and purpose that just isn't there and that they don't know how to create.  Their levels of chronic self-absorption run deep and disclose nothing to grab hold of.  These are characters who seem incapable of coming to terms with the world as they find it, and perhaps consequently are obsessively concerned with affectations and gossipy exchanges over drinks of various kinds in a seemingly inexhaustible collection of cafe's.  They bring to mind the aimless fidgeting of hyper-active children.The narrator and protagonist, Jake, is a determinedly solicitous cipher, everyone's best friend, who comes to us out of nowhere and has no life apart from his ""crowd"" of privileged characters.  Perhaps a bit more abstemious and a bit less conspicuously aimless that the rest, his war wounds have left him helpless in crucial ways.  One wonders just what Jake, and for that matter the rest of the ""crowd,"" is seeking beyond comfortable idleness and, eventually, the excitement generated by artfully staged and savagely manipulated blood sports such as bull fighting.Hemingway's characters seem to be devoid of insight, blinded by the modern world with its limitless but transitory possibilities.  They chat about going to England, South America, the U.S. and anywhere else that might occur to them, but they have no compelling reason not to just stay where they are.  They could write books, and some do, though it's unclear that quality rather than the familial connections of the wealthy gets the occasional book into print.  Besides, what would they write about?  It seems that all they know is each other, and their conversational exchanges are typically so tedious and banal that knowing each other is not knowing very much.  Yes, the fact that their lives are fraught with the tedious and the banal could be the basis for a novel, and perhaps that is Hemingway's point, but if it is, he made it in a tedious and banal way.The characters, moreover, are little able to appreciate the beauty in much of anything unless it takes the painfully brutal form of a bull bred for fighting goring an awkward, defenseless steer in just exactly the right way.  The steer was put in the ring to give the bull something to do, a diversion, the same empty purpose that bullfighting itself serves for its audience.  Something sufficiently ugly, merciless, and unforgiving to penetrate their protective shells of effete indifference.  Ironic that the responses of Hemingway's characters of privilege, with the exception of Robert Cohn, whom the others tolerate but nothing more, is so much like that of the rural peasants attending their annual festival.  Diverted from ennui or diverted from hard work and hardship, apparently there's not much difference.Robert Cohn, moreover is a mystery.  Oddly, this pathetic hanger-on is the only member of the privileged herd that has mastered a blood sport, the sort of attainment on which Hemingway placed an inordinately high value.  But Cohn's skill as a boxer is of no value when it comes to getting what he really wants.  His restraint in tolerating the vicious taunts of Mike and occasionally some of the others, renders his physical prowess pointless.  Besides, Cohn lacks the passionate killer instinct that is the hallmark of a worthy blood sport practitioner.  One wonders why he's there, doing little or nothing but absorbing punishment.  Certainly the mercurial and spoiled Brett is not going to turn her amorous attention toward him, resuming their long dead affair.There is a great deal of descriptive material in this novel, covering cities, villages, cathedrals, distinctively Spanish mountainous terrain, fruitfully flourishing wheat fields, the skin tones of peasants and the wealthy, and a good deal more.  But Hemingway's treatments of even the most inspiring and colorful natural phenomena and man-made artifacts are pretty conventional, lacking in interesting detail, unless a matador is killing a bull.  Perhaps this limitation is one reason why I found myself longing for a narrative.  Modernism is averse to narratives, unnatural patterns of temporal coherence that introduce meaning that is nothing more than an imposition, a conceit that prevents us from seeing the world as it is.  The Sun Also Rises is so substantively sparse, however, that the absence of a narrative leaves us groping for a clue as to why it was written.We live in a world that is cruel and brutal by its very nature.  Why we feel the need to introduce dramatized exaggerations that yield still more pain and lethality and call it an occasion for a waspish game of bridge or a week-long drunken festival topped off by the slaughter of bulls is a mystery.  The psychological and physical savagery that we control is of our own making, but so what?My favorite novel is The Old Man and the Sea, a book of rare beauty and infinite wisdom.  Perhaps in his earlier work, The Sun Also Rises included, Hemingway was developing his art, discovering how to write like a genius.  Otherwise, I can't think of a good reason for writing something so pointlessly empty as this novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOJZUTLVXIHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743297334#wasThisHelpful","REOJZUTLVXIHX","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dashiell's Hammett's classic the Maltese Falcon provides a template for the hard-boiled detective, or more generally noir novel that came into its own and acquired a substantial audience in the U.S. in the first half of the 20th Century.  The underlying background assumption for Hammett's novel is illustrated about half way through the book when protagonist, Sam Spade, tells a story about an ordinary guy walking down a city street past a construction site and coming within a hair's breadth of being killed by a falling cast iron I-beam.  The guy draws the obvious but genuinely profound inference that chance rules the universe and, more to the point, the trust we put in everyday conventions and social relationships is misplaced.  Any of us could be destroyed at any time, and to trust is to place one's self at exaggerated risk.The story of the hunt for the jewel encrusted statue called The Maltese Falcon makes Spade's point in a variety of interesting, sometimes startling, sometimes troubling, and sometimes implausible ways.  If Sam Spade trusts anyone it's his secretary, girl Friday, and perhaps latent love interest Effie Perine.  Beyond that, even the woman with whom he has an affair and who at first seem the embodiment of fresh-faced, even if misused innocence, the woman with whom Spade thinks he may be in love, turns out to be not only a bad risk, but capable of lethal violence if it's in her interest.It's especially intriguing to hear the exchanges between Spade and Brigid O'Shaunnessy near the end of the book.  He really thinks he may be in love with her, but he wonders just what that means.  Brigid swears she's in love with Spade, and he suspects that she might be telling the truth.  But what can Spade -- or anyone -- do if the woman he loves may or may not be trustworthy?  That's a tough one, and Spade wrestles with it, his heart and body telling him one thing, while his street-wise commonsense, tainted with decades of hard-earned cynical wisdom, tells him something else.Dashiell Hammett's prose is clear and uncomplicated, well suited to a no-nonsense character such as Spade.  OK, the author tells us a lot more about the centuries-long history of the Maltese Falcon than we really need to know, but perhaps this is done in the interest of verisimilitude, persuading the reader that the small statue really is something special.Spade himself may be a bit more of a caricature than a prototype.  The guy drinks a lot, chain smokes, seldom sleeps, and never exercises, but he's still got a lean, sculpted face and a well-trained prize fighter's muscular body, except, maybe, for the sloping shoulders, Spade's one physical concession to world-weariness.  He packs a precisely targeted, devastating punch in each fist, and for a big guy he's remarkably nimble and quick.  And the ladies like him.  He's a lot more Robert Mitchum than Humphery Bogart, but either, in his own way, would do quite well portraying Sam Spade.How a private detective like Spade got to be on a first-name basis with the District Attorney in a city the size of San Francisco is a mystery.  But Spade seems to know everyone, and everyone knows Spade.  He's remarkably well-connected, something he puts to good use in his work, which seems to be pretty lucrative.I suppose the most conspicuous villainous characters may be caricatures as well, but Hammett renders them so skillfully that it hardly matters.  In the movie version Sidney Greenstreet played a Mr. Gutman type to perfection, with Peter Lorre doing a great job as someone like Joel Cairo.  Brilliant casting, though neither Greenstreet nor Lorre were as repulsive as Gutman and Cairo.Toward the end, this cast of characters and a few more turn The Maltese Falcon into a pretty complex story, but it's all to the good.  Sam and Effie are back in the office doing mundane things, real life stuff, in other words, and then Iva shows up.  But as we recall from earlier in the novel, Iva's pretty mundane, too.  After all, petty annoyances and mixed feelings are inescapable parts of real life.The Maltese Falcon is an interesting and very well-written novel that paved the way for the full development of the noir genre.  It won't knock your socks off, but it's a good read.  I liked it a lot.  But, then, who's to say my judgment is trustworthy ... ?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZSQIR80E6QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722645#wasThisHelpful","R10ZSQIR80E6QZ","A3TO3AY1UFM83U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TO3AY1UFM83U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Geez, INVICTA, this is a nice looking watch so why not put it in a black presentation box - anything other than the normal egg yolk yellow box which clashes so badly with the coloring of the watch and actually cheapens it in my opinion.  The box just does not do the watch justice but deters from admiring it..........just a thought.............This watch is big and bold and heavy so it is definitely for the person who can wear it and wear it well.It weighs approx 165 grams!  The band is almost 7/8"" wide.  The face of the watch from side to side is almost 1-7/8"".  Top to bottom the case is almost 2"" long.  With a soft tape measure the inside diameter measures approx 9"" so this will fit a large wrist.  And, for a smaller wrist, there is the mall jeweler to remove links.If you are truly looking for a large, impressive watch I would consider this one.  The plating is a good color - it's a rich looking color. The price point seems very reasonable.  INVICTA always shows these huge markdowns so I am not sure what the correct retail would be, but this purchase price seems more than fair.But, the yellow presentation box is just awful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKHA1J5EGRXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKVU8#wasThisHelpful","RJKHA1J5EGRXE","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a decent quality and they are handy to have.  I use them to dry my hands rather than paper towels. They are not super absorbent, but they do the job.  They are just an everyday, usable utility towel.  I don't think I would want to be wiping the counter down with them, but that's just me. For that I will continue to use paper towels.

"We are seniors and the idea of falling while taking a shower is always foremost in our minds, especially when one of us has balance issues.I have tried a lot of shower mats over the years and most have hit the garbage can in a matter of weeks due to mold or not sticking to the tub, etc.As there are no instructions on how best to use this mat, I am very grateful to the reviewer on here (PhotoGraphics) who goes into detailed 'before use' instructions. They are excellent and boy, do they work.  I did clean the tub bottom, I did add hot water and 1 cup of vinegar and I put the mat in upside down for a couple of hours. As the tub drained I turned the mat over and pushed down on it to get as much suction as possible.  The result was no curl in the mat from shipping, very little odor and good - VERY GOOD - suction.  We live in a dry climate so mold is not an issue, but I will pull it up once a month to clean, again using the advice of the reviewer who said to put hot water in the tub and then pull from one end - works great! We have two bathrooms and I have a different mat in each bathtub.Less one star because of the lack of instructions on how to make this mat work the way it should!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VNJYPW0QI8W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4QBMQK#wasThisHelpful","R1VNJYPW0QI8W0","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WhenWhen I read a book these days it is strictly for enjoyment, entertainment and escape.  I want some time away from news, economic and health pressures.  I don't want to read something serious or mind boggling.  I don't care if it is factual or not or appears too far out there to be believable.  I want to like the characters and the plot line. As I said, I want to get lost in a book for however long it takes me to get serious again.I found that with Nine Lives.  I had not read any books by this author prior to Nine Lives.  All I knew was it had a cat(s) in it and that appealed to me.I enjoyed reading it.  I thought it well written and it caught my interest early on.  It was an easy read and that was what I was looking for.

Well, not now!

"REALLY incredible tasting chocolate bars................I had not tasted Scharffen Berger candy before receiving this box and oh my, it is indeed quite different and creamy and to die for good! I was drinking a hot cup of coffee when it arrived and it was the perfect pairing - that and a good book which I also had...........a perfect combination!I am the kind of person who can't say no to a good candy, but this is so rich that I could barely get past half a bar - I did, but it was almost too much at one time. This is not a gobble down chocolate, but one to be tasted and savored............it is THAT good.This is the perfect gift box assortment that is well packaged before mailing and arrives in a quality presentation box.  But, I would also be tempted to include some or all of the bars in a gift basket of assorted items of coffees, teas, cookies, fruits, etc.  The bars are individually wrapped so they are perfect for a basket gift.The calories are high, 440 to 480 - and the sodium is high, from 25 mg to 120 mg, depending on the flavor selected, but the taste and texture are excellent.I really do recommend this gift box for a special gift for yourself or for anyone you care about :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LQRODKAVO8PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QQ4WHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LQRODKAVO8PR","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started using kitchen scales some years ago and find them very useful for dividing up bulk purchases of meat, veggies, etc.And, with health issues in our family, I also find it necessary to weigh some foods and after a while it just becomes second nature and it's so easy to do with this Accuweight scale.  It's easy to read, it's easy to clean, it looks nice on the counter and it's easy to sanitize as I weighed a little cat on it before calling the vet so she would know how much medicine to dispense for her!  Now, that saved me from having to take this little girl in the carrier in the car and stress out the both of us so I love the scale if just for that.  The cat weighs under 10# so it worked splendidly.I did place and weigh a washcloth separately under her before weighing her.AND, I had to mail some medical records and did not want to wait in line at the local post office so I weighed the manila envelope on the scale and knew exactly how much postage to use - I cannot tell you what it meant to me to avoid the post office!It's just a great, functional scale that is also very accurate.I was sent a scale from the manufacturer at no cost to use and review.

"I have very fair skin and I left this on for 40 minutes and I got a natural looking light tan color that I am very pleased with.I have tried several of the XEN-TAN products and each time using one it gets easier.  I have not had a problem with streaking or with the color rubbing off on clothing or bedding, but for the first hour after applying I wear a loose sleepshirt and throw a sheet over my recliner just in case.  So far, no problems.I have learned to exfoliate prior to using any of the XEN-TAN products because it makes the application so much easier.I think this is an excellent product with a pleasant fragrance that does not bother my respiratory issues.  It is easier to apply if using the mitt that is available separately or something similar.  At least it has been for me.I have never been to a tanning salon and my days of being in the sun are long over, so this is a really nice way to look healthier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYCNTD65FZOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R2SYCNTD65FZOH","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not ghost pale, but close to it and with freckles and I have senior skin that at one time did way too much real sun tanning......I have tried several of the XEN-TAN products in the past couple of months and was pleased with the performance of all of them, but this one is definitely my favorite because of the foam.  It's easy to apply, especially with a mitt and it fades so naturally it just seems 'real'!  I only apply it to my face and neck and arms as I wear slacks most of the time.  I have found that putting my facial moisturizer on my skin before applying the XEN-TAN helps the coverage even better.I love this and NO ORANGE!

"You just can't go wrong with Purina!  I grew up on a cattle ranch with cats, dogs, calves, chickens eating Purina products and we had the healthiest animals around.  Seriously.Over the years I have fed my dogs and cats Purina and sometimes wavered and tried other brands, but almost always returned to Purina.Lately I have been able to try some very expensive brands and natural brands and holistic brands and our 4 inside only cats would try them, maybe, and maybe spit them out or go back to the bowl a few times before totally ignoring them.When I opened this bag of Purina all 4 cats were waiting for it to be poured into bowls and started 'scarfing' it down.  They also do that with the Purina Complete we buy on a regular basis for inside and outdoor ferals we feed.  We have bowls out 24/7 for cat grazing and the only other dry foods we have out is Purina Gentle and Iam's Original Chicken.  Purina is preferred.The texture is interesting and different and the cats seemed to like that.I wish the bag was resealable but I always put the food in plastic containers for storage as soon as a bag is opened so it isn't a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G08T4OW4UNHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T2BHUA#wasThisHelpful","R2G08T4OW4UNHW","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been wearing Anne Klein jewelry for many years so was looking forward to getting this watch and I was not disappointed!It really IS a beautiful, classy looking watch.  It measures approx 7-1/2"" long end to end and weighs approx 60 gms so it has a nice weight to it.  The band resembles a woven band I had on a vintage Longines watch.  It is like a wheat pattern.  It is a solid band, yet flexible.  The watch face is approx 1-3/8"" from edge to edge.  It has roman numerals and it is easy to read.  It has a second hand.  So far it is keeping perfect time.  The band itself is approx 5/8"" wide which nicely enhances the large watch face.  So many watches now have a large dial with an itty bitty band that just looks silly.I think Amazon's price is very reasonable considering the quality of this watch.  The high end retail stores will no doubt offer it at a considerable amount more, especially with the holidays around the corner.I put this watch next to my 14k gold one and the color on the Anne Klein is an almost perfect match.  It is a warm, rich color, not at all brassy as some are.I wear an 8"" bracelet and this watch fits me perfect with no draping, but it is not snug either.  Just a good fit.  With the extension piece removed the watch measures about 7"" end to end so will fit a smaller wrist.I love this watch and I'll be wearing it all the time!

"Having said that, I am currently in a chocolate lover's happy coma induced by eating 3 of these bars and allowing my husband to have 2...why not 6 in a box?  Would certainly be more fair for sharing :)These are great tasting with lots and lots of almonds, BUT over-priced in my opinion and should come way down in price during the holidays at local supermarkets.This is not a good item to buy for shipping in summer months.  It was delivered via USPS which was much better than sitting on a UPS truck waiting all day for delivery, but the box - triple boxed from Amazon - still contained almost 5  melted chocolate bars upon delivery to me.  I put the box in the freezer for a little while but then the fancy gold wrapping got stuck in the now solid chocolate making a mess to try and eat.Definitely a great gift to give someone, but I would shop locally for a better price and/or buy separate bars and put them in a basket with other items for a gift :)4 stars because of the price.........","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOZXUT2X0C8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CLE2ZS#wasThisHelpful","RMOZXUT2X0C8P","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never seen a watch for left handed people before and maybe it wasn't intentional to make it that way, but it works great for those of us who are lefties.My husband tried this on and wore it for awhile, but it just wasn't for him so I tried it and I love it.  It's definitely a unisex watch, especially with us gals liking the larger watch faces these days.  It's easy to read and it looks nice on, if you like black bands and watch faces.  I would love to see the company make it in other colors like white and pastels as well as brown, green, etc.  I would definitely buy a couple.So far it is keeping excellent time.  I am happy with this watch and again, if you like a larger dial, then this is a good watch for you. I am not finding it too heavy to wear either.  It is not a light watch, but it is balanced with the width of the band enough that the weight is distributed evenly, at least for me it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOGNCWJEXCUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPTGH26#wasThisHelpful","R2MOGNCWJEXCUF","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A gift for yourself or for someone who really loves to shave with a superior quality electric shaver.My husband has been using Philips Norelco shavers for a long time, preferring them over two other top name brands. This is the first time I have seen and heard him really 'like' the shaver.  And, then comment to me on what a smooth shave he got and how quiet it is to use and on and on and on......he definitely is happy with it.It's a beautiful shaver to look at as well and it fits nicely in the hand. And, honestly, I didn't see 'for men only' written anyplace on the box and I wanted to try it on my legs - just try it.......wow - now I want it :)It does have a higher price point than some, but comes with an excellent warranty and if it holds up as well as is stated it does, then in the long run it will be less expensive to use than those that require frequent replacements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQGS47HRGD8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","RCQGS47HRGD8H","A1IZJVLNMFACS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IZJVLNMFACS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"okay, it fits in the palm of the hand nicely, but when I want to use tape I want the dispenser sitting on the desk facing me so I can tear off the tape at the length I need.  When trying to do this with the WANT:D Tape Dispenser, the dispenser pulls forward and the back end lifts off the desk.  Yes, it has a soft 'grip like' underneath, but it doesn't keep it from pulling forward when in use.  I have a glass top on my desk.I did not have the problem with the installed tape that some other reviewers had.  Mine started correctly and has not split. I did have a problem cutting the tape because the cutting edge seems off a bit on mine and I have to pull down with some force to get it to cut properly and then I nipped my finger on it. I am just not sure about the durability of the dispenser with a lot of use. For that reason I gave it three stars.

"As I got into THE PLUMED BONNET, I wondered if it would be a rerun of THE FAMOUS HEROINE.  Two middle-class heroines, both intimidated by the aristocracy.  I learned there was little similarity between the two.THE FAMOUS HEROINE was almost farcical...quite funny in spots.  An agreeable story though I grew a little tired of Cora's continued angst every time she met a ""title.""  Heavenly days, she was associating with ""titles"" on a daily basis.  I grew seriously tired of Francis' ongoing broken heart.  Nonetheless, it was an amusing story.THE PLUMED BONNET was a horse of another color.  A very good story with remarkable depth considering its length.  Both characters were well developed.  We learned of Stephanie throughout the story; we mostly came to know Alistair during the latter part of the tale.  I thought that was quite an interesting way of developing his character...and it was done very well.Both stories were a pleasure but the second was far more impressive.

Sophronia is reluctantly on her way to her cousin's home to care for his six children and an alarming number of chickens.

Clearly, she succeeded with everyone but me.  I did enjoy two or three chuckles.  Overall, the prose seemed stiff, stilted.I only have two major complaints:1)  Sophronia, who is reputed to be very intelligent, seduces James because she wants ""to have one experience to take with her into spinsterhood.""  Where have I seen that stupid stunt before?  Dumb bunny.  No thought for the surprise package she may take with her to the cottage.  This never fails to irritate me.

"While a sweet, gentle romance does unfold within the pages, this is more an historical novel, in my view.  Even Ms.Kelly says that romance is secondary to history in her stories.  And this is an excellent historical novel.  The blurb, btw, is very good and tells you exactly how Douglas ends up in the small Scottish village by the sea and his meeting Olive.The novel is written at a measured pace.  Actually, as it began, I didn't know if I would like it.  But I persisted and was rewarded by a very good story. The friendship between Douglas and Olive is entwined within the larger story of a poor village that has had the added burden of evicted Highlanders thrust upon it.  Those poor Highlanders are a small sample of those many wretched victims of the Clearances.  The lairds betrayed their clans in the most brutal, cruel way.  According to histories I've read of these abominations, Ms. Kelly, in no way, exaggerates the terrible events.Then think of an impoverished village suddenly finding these ill-equipped, starving Highlanders in their midst.  But through the actions of one man and one woman, the fabric of the community is gradually made whole.  And their friendship continues to blossom.I didn't feel a sigh at the end...much of the subject matter was too serious.  And the romance, while it did slowly evolve, did so inconspicuously.I do agree with Amazon Customer in suggesting Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand as an excellent read.  There are others, as well.  Ms. Kelly has much to offer in the way of superior reading.Enjoy your reading! :)  .","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2XXFB5X2BNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0172NFJ6W#wasThisHelpful","R1H2XXFB5X2BNU","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No blurb, no nothing, I bought this on hope, alone.  I know Ms. Marshall can write, her Hester Waring's Marriage (The Dilhorne Dynasty) is outstanding.Athene is beautiful, clever, not in clover financially, and illegitimate.  Though some suspect her irregular birth, no one actually knows and it had no effect on her childhood.  Now grown, Athene's dream is to make a grand marriage, and she's given the chance to travel to London for the Season as companion to a younger school friend, Emma.  Athene's youth as a companion is explained by the fact that Emma's a wimp who would be stifled by an older woman.  Okay.At their first ball, they meet the kind, lightweight Adrian who is a wealthy Scottish earl and his cousin, Nick, who owns a castle in Scotland...we're not told if he's an heir or younger son.  Adrian is immediately dazzled by the gorgeous Athene, Nick is immediately suspicious of her.The story follows the usual predictable formula with the addition of Louise, Athene's old friend, who is a missing marchioness but is masquerading as a French modiste.  Louise may be the heroine of an up-coming novel.  Then the reclusive Duke of Inglesham takes one look at Athene and enters the story.  His involvement is immediately transparent to the reader but Nick is jealous (he's not suspicious now, he's in love.)  Athene has dumped Adrian and he has moved on to Emma.There is very little character development, we're left with loose ends because, I guess, this is only Book 8 of a SIXTEEN-BOOK SERIES.  Sixteen books of superficial stories, undeveloped characters?We're left with an unsatisfactory get-it-over-with HEA plus an HEA for a secondary romance that was so undeveloped it was invisible.  Maybe that story will be in another book of the series, maybe not.After having read HESTER WARING'S MARRIAGE, it's hard to believe Paula Marshall also produced this.(This book was returned.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LH8BWJRN25MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017JWKYC#wasThisHelpful","R2LH8BWJRN25MG","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thirteen years ago, Mary, 17, and Russell, 20, fell in love during an enchanted summer.  Both brilliant mathematicians, their enthusiastic studies were accompanied by their growing awareness of each other as love bloomed.  Then, suddenly, their love and hopes were dashed, each thinking the other guilty of betrayal.Mary immediately wed a man much her senior and spent the years using her talents assisting her scholar husband.  Russell, constantly demeaned by his father who denied him every opportunity to do something meaningful, spent those years as an idle heir of his father's earldom.They meet at a house party, all those years later, still smarting from the old hurts.  Mary, now a widow and Russell, a vaguely unhappy and dissatisfied gentleman.  Tensions ease, a tentative rapport is established, and the first seeds of Russell's revolt are sown.  He travels north to a neglected estate, encounters Mary who is also traveling to a home in the area and further blossoming ensues.The story of Russell coming into his own and the gradually unfolding romance were interesting and lovely.  Russell and Mary had unraveled the deceit of years ago about half-way through the story.  There were other characters and other loose ends, and that's where it got swampy for me.  The last 25% was awash in too many characters with too many loose ends.  The author did her job and tightly tied every single one.  It was as if she checked them off a list amid a morass of words.Anyway, for those interested, this is a clean romance.

Repetition eventually grew tiresome...not funny.  The h can't accidentally hit the H three times and keep me laughing.  The H can't repeatedly wreck his clothes and still be amusing.

"Daniel is estranged from a witch of a wife; he's conflicted about his vocation, though he doesn't fully realize this for some time; now he has arrived at Haddondale to assume the mantle of local vicar.  Lady Kirsten is smart, out-spoken, and has had two broken engagements.Honestly, I can't think of much to say.  While I'm not a fan of 'vicar' stories, this was written well enough to hold my attention to the end.  Daniel is a lovely man, Kirsten is an admirable woman.Much of the story consists of Daniel, with Kirsten's assistance, taking several local boys in hand and teaching them.  (I wish I'd been so perfect with my own.)  There is a little anxiety surrounding Daniel's nephew but Daniel solves that problem with perfect aplomb.  Increasing angst relating to the nasty wife surfaces from time to time but Daniel will find the perfect solution for that too.  Kirsten comes up with perfect ideas of her own.  They were involved in one circumstance that was something less than perfect, but being perfect, Daniel explained it away to perfection.In fact, they're just perfect.  Not real to me.This made such an impression on me that, by the time I began writing this review, I had to look up the heroine's name.

"First, I can guarantee this novel works very well as a standalone.  Turns out I'd read the previous two books some time ago but had forgotten everything.  (I only remember the novels I really love or really hate, and those two didn't make the cut in either direction.)  So there.  You'll be just fine without having read the first two.  I liked this one.There once was a girl in want of thirty pounds.  Thus began the saga of Laure Seraphine Edouard Lecroy-Duplessis/Laura Edwards/Gemma Holyrood.  Laura, daughter of a French comte murdered during the Terror, escaped to England with her mother and brother.  Penniless, they were spurned by her uncle, the Duke of Saltash.  (He's a nasty piece of work.) Laura and her mother work as seamstresses for a theater company; Laura's brother, Jack, longs to become a physician; Laura needs that thirty pounds to provide for Jack's education; and Gemma Holyrood is born...star of the stage!  This is where Rushford comes in.  He courts her nightly in the green room with no success.  No man succeeds.  Gemma smiles and flirts...that's it.  But Jasper Rushford is our persistent hero.  Jasper is a good person; he's kind, witty, good-natured, and the soul of honor.  He's on the outs with his parents, adores his half-sister, Sophy, and likes her husband, Tom.The whole famdamly comes together when Tom invites Jack to Suffolk with a view toward Jack becoming the local physician.  Jack prevails upon Laura to visit, Jasper's in attendance too, natch, and things get interesting.The story continues apace.  Saltash rears his ugly head.

But Jasper will save the day, I just know it!The story moves briskly along; the dialogue is crisp, much of it witty; pleasing narrative; only a few anachronisms strewn like the occasional rock on a path...stubs my sensibilities but no damage done.

"That's the ending of a little ditty that turns out to be of some significance in our story.The first in the trilogy, Claire, After All (The Penwarrens Book 1), was pure delight, the second book was a miss for me, but the sparkling dialogue and narrative returned in force in this novel.  I liked it a lot..Rose, the daughter of the H/h of 'Claire', is independent, compassionate, and charmingly direct.  Dr. John Merton, 5th Duke of Quill is kind, compassionate, and reclusive.  The third character of interest is Baroness Juliana de Anselme.  The three come together when the Baroness' carriage hits a young boy who had darted into the street, Rose dashes to his rescue, and John dashes to help.They collaborate in smuggling the child into Rose's cousin's home, arranging plausible reasons for John to appear and sneak up to the child's bedroom in order to care for him.  Naturally, the three become good friends.Of course, there's much more to this tale amid some delightful dialogue and narrative.

"There is nothing wrong with the writing, e.g., the words are strung together properly.  It's a perfectly nice saccharin tale and the protagonists are perfectly nice people.  The real advantage I see to this novel is the insight it offers into the background of John, 5th Duke of Quill, who has a starring role in the following novel, JUBILEE ROSE which I liked a lot.In this story, Abby once expressed impatience with frustration and tedium.  I share her pain.  It was a task getting through the last 25% of this.  Zero tension~incomplete character development~nothing happened...oh yes, Gus ran off, but was quickly found so there went that flurry of excitement~there were brief hints of preachiness and prayers which annoyed.The entire story may be summed up:  Abby cares for Chloe and Gus~they keep Gus' dog hidden~they avoid the duke~Gus runs off~they find him~ William is in and out~so is John~HEA.  My life is more interesting than this!I really liked CLAIRE, AFTER ALL and JUBILEE ROSE.

"And that's Minerva!  This grand story began with a prologue filled with pathos and ended with an epilogue that had me laughing out loud.  And in between it was all about Minerva and Ashe.A beautifully sensual story, not cut-and-paste sex scenes that are yawners.  No, this was sensual and it required writing of originality...which it had, in spades.  Very well written, every scene was evocative and a pleasure to read.  In fact, I enjoyed the story immensely.The Hellions fit in perfectly with the Scoundrels.  Minerva and Ashe were wonderful characters, sufficiently complex, but they didn't beat me down with angst.  Nor did the story.  Of course, the road to a HEA had its bumps and snags and I'm not going to talk about them.  Mum's the word:)  I will only say there were a couple of interesting, startling plot twists.I will say I really liked this introduction of The Hellions...all very different men, all with their own stories.

"This was a pre-order for me and I anticipated a really good (probably great) novel.  Didn't quite work out and I'm sick about it.A newly-minted earl with a dilapidated estate laden with debt, Devon began life in this story as a cold-hearted rake.  But we soon began to see his growth into a responsible, pragmatic peer and landowner.  He became quite likable.Kathleen, on the other hand, was a pain in the neck.  I never warmed to her.  The only Kathleen I saw was brittle, sharp-tongued, judgmental, forever jumping to wrong conclusions, hypocritical, whiny.  Not likable.The novel was uneven to me, up and down, largely because just as we were trundling along with a normal Devon, the mood drastically changed when unpleasant Kathleen popped up.  Why couldn't there have been a little more development of Devon's and Kathleen's thoughts and relationship?  Just add a few pages to tell us what's going on with the H/h.  Then again, a thousand more pages probably couldn't have made Kathleen bearable.The secondary characters were very likable and I was particularly intrigued by the budding secondary romance.  In fact, this novel seemed designed to set up that romance and others to follow.  To stand on its own, as just Devon's and Kathleen's story, it doesn't approach others written by Ms. Kleypas, in my opinion.  I look forward to the next novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ED1L6SUYZIMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLULO7K#wasThisHelpful","R2ED1L6SUYZIMK","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sebastian, the newly-minted Marquess of Manwaring, had secrets from his past and the reputation of a rake.  Katherine, his uncle's widow, appeared aloof (she was actually shy) and had a secret of her own.After a sojourn abroad, Sebastian had returned to England determined to live a normal life.  But wait!  As soon as he got off the boat, he was challenged to a duel by a furious father.  So much for normalcy and his hopes for making romantic headway with Katherine.I liked the satire in this novel.  There was some humor and occasional witty repartee which I also enjoyed.  There was some slapstick, various dogs, and numerous misunderstandings on the way to an HEA.Sebastian began life in this story as the quintessential rake in his mid-thirties but later came across more like a teenager...who pouted...a lot.  After that, the Grand Passion just seemed a bit fatuous to me.Those who enjoyed the first in the series may like this one as well, although there are more scenes with serious overtones.Enjoy your reading! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WG5F1DW91SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7XBOUS#wasThisHelpful","R22WG5F1DW91SW","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Georgian Period and Ms. Veryan clearly knows it well.Captain Gideon Rossiter returned home to turmoil.  His father had been ruined financially, Gideon had been dumped by his betrothed, and the tale was the story of his efforts to 'fix' things.  He came to believe there was a conspiracy afoot and off we went.I liked Gideon. His love, Naomi, struck me as a lightweight.  Gideon's father seemed a bit thick.  Other secondary characters, most of whom were likable, were introduced.  I understand they will feature prominently in succeeding books and had roles of varying importance in this novel.The story was slow to start.  At times, the mystery was quite good though it faltered occasionally.  Sometimes, the love scenes seemed to come from out of the blue ~ not much preparation by the author ~ and they were a bit syrupy for me.  And the gadding about!  Did we really have to visit every single inn and pub in London?  I'll grant you, they were frantically hunting for Gideon's sorry brother, but it went on and on and on.  A certain amount of that can heighten excitement and suspense; too much grows tedious.  Then, too, the plot seemed to wobble.  There was some humor, the most entertaining involving the most irascible character, August Falcon.  The duel was a riot.But there were three things that made little sense to me:1)  Picture a woman wearing a ball gown with  those wide panniers, standing on a ledge 15 INCHES wide.  She's facing the wall but the next thing we know, she has her back to the wall.  Wearing that getup, how did she turn around?  No way, Jose.2)  Gideon presents a cryptic note, an appointment book and a chess piece to Bow Street and is outraged that they won't arrest the nobleman from whom he'd stolen the items.  We know their significance but it's awful thin stuff for Bow Street.3)  ***SPOILERISH***  Gideon's friends are on the scene of the denouement, nab some bad guys, yet no one sees the villain?  They don't hear him?  Naomidoesn't hear him???  Seems a little lame.Then we have Rossiter's downfall.  That was nothing more than a personal grudge, with a couple of chessmen thrown in to tie the story to The Jewelled Men.  The connection could have been written much more adroitly, imo.It has been a couple of days since I read this story and I'm still annoyed ~ by the poor plotting, shallow heroine, dense father, the many inanities, the generally poor execution.I understand the other novels in this series are very good.  Hope so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OR10M8N2V7F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFP42#wasThisHelpful","R3OR10M8N2V7F7","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What really struck me about this novel...in a good way...was the natural progression of the sweet love story.  From beginning to end, it was realistic and proceeded at a gently steady pace.  Nothing rushed.  And that's not all that won the prize from me.  The narrative made for such smooth reading ~ the dialogue was clever, witty, and fun ~ the characters were real, normal, and likable (oh, the cousin was a goofus but he was good for comic relief:)For most of her life, Claire had been required to manage her father's household so, naturally, she was a ""managing female.""  Not in an unpleasant way,  though.  She loved her family and she dealt with them with wisdom, kindness and humor.Symonton had suffered a bizarre disappointment in his youth at the hands of an ""evil woman,"" so he was cynical regarding the fair sex.  Well, poor guy, he found himself a little flummoxed by Claire.  We could see that he just didn't know which end was up where she was concerned but he was determined to play it cool. lolIf you're looking for something deep, serious, angsty, with villains, this isn't for you.  As the author said, herself, she intended this to be a lighthearted tale.  She succeeded beautifully and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.  She wrote a story that was exactly as advertised, it was just what I was looking for, and I liked it a lot.  I was surprised, actually.(This is yet another story I've read via Kindle Unlimited.)

"After suffering three duds in a row, this little story was a breath of fresh air.  I enjoy this author's prose ~ she writes with a light hand, an easy, flowing style, with sly wit and gentle humor.There's no heavy breathing here.  The romances (there are three) are actually peripheral to the story and they're rather wooden and abrupt.  This is largely the story of the dynamics of the inhabitants of the small village of Piddledean (!) whose staff of life is news.  They've been awaiting the arrival of the lord of the manor for years, they have learned the Battle of Waterloo has been won, and now dashing young Lord Charles Ramsey has suddenly appeared to take up residency at Greymere at last.There is much hustle and bustle, flurries of notes to and fro.  And amid all the twitters of excitement, Katherine is ensconced in her late father's study, frantically trying to finish his latest gothic novel.  As she has discovered these novels to have been the main source of income for her family, she must quickly become an author and take up her father's reins.In addition to the amusing activities of the Piddledeanians, the uproar of the lord's arrival, and Katherine's literary struggles, the author gives us a small glimpse into the angst suffered by authors during the creative process.  That is, *good* authors.  I'm convinced that readers are the only ones who suffer from many of those written works sailing under the false colors of ""novels.""  But I digress.Not deep.  Not complicated.  This is a happy little slice of village life, interesting characters, a little action here and there, written well, and there are no irritations.  At this point, that was a major consideration for me ~ no irritations.  Well, maybe one ~ I wish I could have said ""Piddledeanians"" more than once in this review.(I had the pleasure of reading this via Kindle Unlimited.)Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKXQ5SXHHNPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CRSLUU#wasThisHelpful","R3HKXQ5SXHHNPH","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A penniless widow, Eve has arrived at Willomere to chaperon the earl's two American nieces.  Fitz, the earl's charming, devil-may-care brother is also in residence.  Reputation is everything to Eve.  Fun is everything to Fitz and he sure isn't interested in marriage...affairs are his style.There is a good mystery within the somewhat rambling story.  Lots of secondary characters, tertiary characters ~ the book is loaded with them.  There's a French balloonist who crash lands on the property, breaking his leg, so he's part of the crowd.  We have a measles outbreak that incapacitates one of the nieces, several servants as well as Sabrina, a narcissistic witch who lives down the road and is married to a kind older gentleman.  Oh, Colonel Willingham drops by too.  He was Eve's late husband's (that's Bruce...he's also part of the story) commanding officer.  Lotsa people.Amid all these doings Eve begins receiving increasingly threatening letters, the house is broken into, Neville is charming Lily, and a romance develops between Eve and Fitz.  Here's where I wound up with major squawks:***SPOILER***1)  ""Reputation is Everything Eve"" is so charmed by that rascal, Fitz, she decides to heck with it...she wants one glorious experience to take with her into old age, so they have at it.  And there isn't just one ""glorious experience,"" they go at it like rabbits.  If she isn't preggy by now, I'll eat my hat.Anddd, she knows from day one that Fitz has *zero* plans to marry her, he just wants an affair.  What's an illegitimate kid going to do for the ""reputation"" she supposedly values?  Not to mention future employment?Why do authors write such dumb-as-dirt heroines?  I'm tired of them.2)  Meanwhile, Neville, who has had an understanding with Priscilla (yet another character) for years is about to bail on her and take off for Gretna Green with Lily, thereby wrecking the reputations of both girls.  A real upstanding kinda guy, isn't he?  Why did the author make Neville such a sleazebag?***END SPOILER***The author did some acrobatics and all's well that ends well.I put this book aside a number of times before finally finishing it.  Even aside from my issues with it, I was just never really engaged by it.  The mystery was interesting but the story moseyed and wandered too much.

"The first 30% was devoted to the 'honorable' hero's lustful thoughts and plans to seduce his ward's governess.  Meanwhile, the heroine, who had suffered a violently cruel marriage, was having lustful imaginings about her boss.  I'd say she had made an amazingly quick recovery from her recent ordeals or she's a glutton for punishment.At the 30% mark we finally see an inkling of a story...but only an inkling.  Then it's back to the lustful stuff.  Then a tiny smattering of story.  Then a Big Misunderstanding.  Then on to full blown sex ~ no worries about consequences.  Then there's the Big Secret.  Then he proposes and she tuns him down~an earl marrying a governess is not done, plus she's lugging around the Big Secret.  Then we have the appropriate gnashing of teeth.  Then back to story where the Big Secret is revealed.  Then another Big Misunderstanding.  And so it goes...and they live happily ever after.If you think this review is confusing, try the story...no, don't.

"This was an obvious take on the Oxford progeny.  The story began in usual Layton style ~ good dialogue, sparkling narrative.  The pace quickly slowed, however, and the plot wandered.  It became a bit draggy and cumbersome.  Still, it was fair reading until the mid-point.**SPOILER** That's when we learn that Lord North, a viscount, was ADOPTED!  That is impossible among the peerage..  Always has been.  I read along hoping the author would somehow fix the problem.  She fixed it all right.  It was subsequently revealed that he was his father's by-blow...a BASTARD.  Another impossibility.  Heirs among the peerage must be legitimate.  And remember, Lord North is represented to us as a viscount, ergo, member of the peerage.  **END SPOILER**I give a pass on a lot of foul-ups in novels written years ago.  But these mistakes are monstrous.The thing is, even before the internet, Ms. Layton obviously did considerable research, even of some relatively little-known aspects of the period.  It wouldn't have taken more than five minutes with a book to get the BASIC FACTS OF HER PREMISE straight, but she didn't.  I'm mystified because it left her entire story with no foundation at all.These aren't little things ~ they destroy the whole fabric of the story.  We're left with nothing...Lord North was the hero, for pity's sake!  I don't expect a lot in the way of plausibility in HRs.  But this one, no.  This story is not improbable, it's utterly impossible.  Even if set aside the inconvenient facts and just talk fairy tales, where the impossible happens, still, even at that level, this is only mediocre.Many of us are anxious to read Ms. Layton's books that are now being released.  It might be wise, though, to use the services of a knowledgeable and ruthless editor prior to publishing.What a mess.

"As I began reading the first page, I thought oh, no, first person~groan.  I invariably hate first person where we're usually stuck with knowing all about that person and nothing of the other characters.  Well, not to worry here.  Ms. Wolf has the talent and the range to encompass any writing style.  And the imagery in her novels (including this one) is spectacular and so real.  I'm not crazy about mysteries, either, but this one sure had me engaged.Yes, the hero is handsome, rich and perfect.  Yes, the heroine is poor, struggling and perfect.  But we were given a complex story.  My stars, had the H and h also been complex, flawed, etc., the novel would have been 1,000 pages long!  Anyway, despite their perfection, the H and h were real to me...they were just fine.My only quibble...a very minor quibble...was how abruptly the mistressing, the arrangement, was sprung on us.  Maybe I was just slow on the uptake, though.  Anyway, the h had some sense so I got over it.Since the show has already been given away in a spotlighted review, I'll chime in with my two cents worth:  Had the villain been put on trial, it is entirely likely...*very probable*...he would have been acquitted.  There was no proof!  Instead, his punishment by the H was singularly appropriate.Yes, it's not difficult to identify the villain, but I remained hung up on the wrong target.  I never did quite manage to solve the puzzle.  So, Ms. Wolf certainly succeeded in making a good mystery-cum-romance out of this.  The pacing didn't always move at a gallop but it remained steady enough.So, two things that are usually real turn offs for me...first person and mystery...and darn, I liked the story!Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VV539J5HVK6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3CUAPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VV539J5HVK6P","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A quality standard historical romance, *not* a quality Survivors Club novel.  With her history, Imogen's story should have been a knock-your-socks-off kind of story.  It fell flat for me.Percy was a perfectly nice man, a bored man.  He met Imogen and they had an affair.  Instead of thoroughly exploring their romance, we were beset by his tribe of relatives and friends.  Who cared?  All their goings-on detracted from the story.Then ~ and this was a major issue for me ~ Imogen didn't tell her whole story to Percy at the ball.  She told him (and us) a small part...a teaser, and waited until nearly the end to tell him the rest of her experience.  This totally destroyed the emotional impact of what should have been a wrenching, emotive revelation.  Like a leaking tire.And where were the other Survivors?  We didn't see a single one until near the end.  Instead, we were stuck with that gaggle of geese Percy called 'family.'I originally planned to give this 4 stars because it is quality HR fare, but changed my mind because it was a pretty poor effort for the Survivors Club .  I think Balogh did Imogen dirt with this one.As for the preview of George's story...well, if that was designed to entice, it doesn't.

"I think a reader who has not read True Story (The Deverells Book 1) may enjoy this novel, and it does fine as a standalone.  The author is very gifted.  But I had read True Story, a remarkably superior novel, and  the plot of this one struck me as deja vu lite and I was disappointed.Nice, strong hero ~ gutsy, admirable heroine.  The story was okay, the dialogue pretty fair, sometimes sparkling.

"So often, with series, the grand culmination of it all ends up fizzling.  This story definitely did not do that.  The romance, itself, lived up to all the great expectations readers have been living on, seemingly forever.  Now we know why Olivia moped all those years.  I would too.Through the artful use of flashbacks, we saw the sweet love between Lyon and Olivia and their sublime sense of oneness develop.  Truly one soul.  Really one of the most moving love stories I have read.In general, the story of Lyon and Olivia was beautifully written, expressing the intensity of a great love.  The love story was very satisfying.  There were also scenes of exquisite imagery sprinkled here and there as well as engaging dialogue.After finishing the novel with a gusty sigh, I took a step back and realized two things ~ 1.  During their leave taking five years earlier, Olivia's words didn't ring true.  There were a number of things she could have said without resorting to a cliche.  She simply didn't stay in character.  That entire pivotal scene seemed lacking.  2.  The ending was contrived and had an element of unnecessary humiliation.  The collateral damage left a bad taste in my mouth.  This from kind Olivia?Despite those caveats, I was so invested in the characters, I accepted everything with just a couple of blinks and a moan.  The love story was truly lovely and very emotive.

"(No Verified Purchase badge here because I borrowed the ebook.)Matthew drove this story.  He was a wonderfully sympathetic hero ~ steady, kind, intelligent, yet strong.  A widower, his was a lonely life.  And into his life came Theresa, who touched my heart ~ her strength of character had enabled her to overcome years of adversity and shame.This was a character-driven novel.  Intense, yet written with a light hand...it didn't plunge me into a morass of angst.  It's a story of two admirable people who had each suffered many years from mistakes in their youth.  They've done the best they could to right their ships and live honorably.  And then they met.Their story was engaging, stimulating, with dollops of humor throughout.  I was particularly impressed that the characters were so *real* ~ no stick figures in this one.  Of course, there was a bit of mystery and excitement too.  I was really blindsided by the resolution of the mystery!I had just one quibble:  Given her history, I was surprised that Theresa was ready for sex at about the 40% point, after not much wooing.  It seemed to me that it would have been more reasonable to have expected a slowly-developing relationship and  some serious courting by Matthew.In many ways, Matthew reminded me of Worth, from Worth Lord Of Reckoning (The Lonely Lords Book 11).  I loved Worth too.Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ80TBS0LYGXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QCD836#wasThisHelpful","RQ80TBS0LYGXN","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This began well.....it was funny and engaging.  Then it fizzled.  Too many UNsensual sensual scenes...just stiffly written.  Characters only superficially developed.  Very predictable plot.Plot holes galore ~ 1.  You're telling me a powerful duke doesn't have the wherewithal to put paid to his heir's machinations?  Instead, he's all scared and worried?  Definitely not duke-ish.  2.  The h's cousin, an earl, just floats around not doing much, instead of immediately straightening her out on proper behavior in England.  Not earl-ish.  3.  The h persists in thinking she can become a governess.  Is she crazy?  4.  Her extreme naivete beggars belief.  No one her age could conceivably be so profoundly innocent.  5.  Her instant recovery from an extremely harrowing ordeal makes no sense at all.  None.  6.  There are more, but you get the drift.  Illogical.I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them and if I'm told I'm in for a fairy tale, I won't expect things to make sense.

"Ralph, Lord Adversane, hired an impoverished gentlewoman, Lucy, to pretend to be his fiancee during a house party.  Ostensibly, his reason for this was to quiet those who had nagged him to remarry following the death of his wife two years prior.  In truth, his reason for the gathering was to ferret out the reason for his wife's death...she had fallen to her death.  He had been with other guests at the time but thought he may have driven her to suicide...or was she meeting a lover?  In hopes of learning the truth, he decided to replicate the house party during which the wife had died.He chose Lucy because she strongly resembled the dead wife.  He had a wardrobe identical to that of the wife's made for her and didn't tell Lucy of his scheme.  At that point, the whole thing began to seem a little creepy to me.The story became more overwrought page by page.  And it wasn't helped by poor research that had the dead wife's parents pushing Avendale to marry the late wife's sister.  While not impossible, that would have generally been considered incestuous, illegal, and any children illegitimate.  I can't see a baron taking that chance.If you like the style of a Mrs. Radcliffe Gothic, with little foundation in reality, you may enjoy this.  I didn't.  The story moved slowly with much repetition.  The h's character was rather well drawn but the H was wooden...and o/c he carried the Big Secret of his scheme through most of the story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZYVY4EJ1I14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I66GCFC#wasThisHelpful","R3TZYVY4EJ1I14","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was tons of fun!  A sweet romance and a rollicking adventure.  Jonathan is a viscount who writes biting satires under the pseudonym, Dash ~ among others.  Tally (Lady Talitha,) a gifted caricaturist known as Mouse, collaborates with him on his latest effort, ""Town Bronze"", a novel in serial form that has the ton all abuzz.Tally and Jonathan are grand as are their friends, Cat and Richard.  Naturally, all the characters can't be nice, so we have Jonathan's fiancee, Clea ~ a nasty piece of work, and her sidekick, Miles ~ equally unpleasant.We have humor, great characters, a blooming romance, traitors, spies, abduction, some funny escapades, and some surprises.  You'd think that with all this going on, the plot could get lost, the story could ramble, but it doesn't.

"The premise caught my eye and I was pleased that the story took place outside the usual ton milieu.  Our characters were gentry, not peers, and the story took place in, and around, their home in the country.The novel began well ~ it was interesting, amusing, and the dialogue was entertaining.  The tale began to bog down, though, about a third of the way into it.  The dialogue petered out and it became more narrative, more 'telling.'  And much of that narrative was beside the point and did nothing to move the story forward.  For example, while I was interested in learning *something* of the horses, I did sometimes wonder if I were reading a horse story rather than a romance.  The same applies to the passages that prosed on about Caroline's daily activities and her thoughts surrounding them.  She was bored and so was I.Yes, there was danger, but it didn't raise my heart rate because of the excessive narration.  The mystery was pretty good.  The romance was rather wooden.  The plot was patchy ~ I couldn't decide if the romance was the plot with a mystery subplot, or vice versa.  It really seemed to be two subplots.Despite the miles of introspection, the characters were insufficiently developed.  We knew a little more of Caroline, but it was largely superficial.In my opinion, what could have been a very good story really suffered from 1) non-stop narration/little meaningful dialogue, 2) the equally endless introspection by the H and the h, 3) vague plot, 4) lack of a ruthless editor.  These factors resulted in a novel that moved very slowly with stilted writing.  Actually, before setting out to write this story, a strong outline would have been helpful.And it's ""chord,"" not ""cord,"" btw.  Spell check doesn't solve everything.(I received this book via Kindle Unlimited.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KEG187T7M8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG31N82#wasThisHelpful","R5KEG187T7M8D","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"FYI, no sex in this novel.  This is a very good story - a debut - by a talented author.  Jerome, Lord Orbury, is truly a prince among men.  And Lady Sophia...ah, Sophia.  She shows such kindness and gumption.Sophia was terribly victimized and abused.  Following the death of her husband in a duel, disowned by her family, she retreated to the countryside where she turns her home into a sanctuary for unwed mothers who have been cast off by their families.  Jerome wanders into this situation when he approaches Sophia to buy some property and helps her when a crisis ensues.The scene shifts to London where the property deal will be pursued and we begin to see the malicious hypocrisy of the ton.  Very well drawn for us is the utter helplessness of women of the era as well as the ignorance in which they were kept.  As Sophia said, ""Usually the law is made by good men, men who would never deliberately hurt the helpless, but because they would only use the laws well, they don't set safeguards in place to stop men who are not as good as they.""This is not a heavy book.....one to drag you into the doldrums.  There are some very intense scenes but they are nicely balanced by charming scenes and the lovely progression of Jerome's and Sophia's love story.The bedroom scene was enchanting and made me love Jerome all over again.The story was well written, the plot was very interesting, and the author told us what we wanted to know about the characters.  I liked the novel a lot.The only quibble I have is with the copy-editing and that's not the author's fault.....it happens all the time during the transition of a work to Kindle.  The blips weren't enough to interfere with my enjoyment of the novel.Great new author!(I borrowed this book with my Kindle Unlimited subscription.)Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AM0GRHR1G7YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVBMHIS#wasThisHelpful","R1AM0GRHR1G7YZ","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I began this captivating series with the third novel, The Eyes of Love (The Carlisle Chronicles Book 3), and was immediately seduced by this author's exquisite gift for imagery and fine story-telling.  I highly recommend that novel, by the way.This story began with an event that will have you rolling your eyes and thinking oh, no, this is going to be ridiculous.  But it's not, not when you come to know the heroine's unconventional family and her eccentric, scholarly father.  Our strong heroine is matched by our strong, kind, caring hero.I must say the early part of the novel was a bit slow going for me.  In retrospect, I think that was entirely because of the ""event.""  I simply wasn't prepared to take the story seriously.  As I continued to read, however, the story became interesting and quite lovely.

"Having very recently read the stellar A Baron for Becky, I know Jude Knight is an exceptionally talented author.  In that marvelous novel, the premise was unusual, the plot was clearly defined, the characters well developed, the writing was seamless, and the historical details were spot on.  I loved that story!  But I don't know what happened with this one.I couldn't get a grip on the plot.  There was a plot, a sub-plot, a sub-sub plot, a sub-sub-sub plot...  There was no focus.  We had a myriad of characters but knew little about them because of the excessive plotting.  There were villainous characters galore about whom I learned far more than I wanted to know.  They contributed some extremely distasteful passages and the detail added nothing to the story.  The many side stories and villains were probably meant to lend excitement but they lent irritation instead.I hung in there until the last 30% when the story just became Minerva Press-ish.  That did me in.This novel was in desperate need of a ruthless editor.Now you'd think that after my complaints, I'd be through with Jude Knight and the Redepennings.  WRONG.  I think Ms. Knight has the makings of a brilliant author and I love the Redepenning family.  I look forward to ENCOURAGING PRUDENCE (David's story) and to A RAGING MADNESS (Alex's story.)ETA:  Now that I've calmed down, I'm reminded that this *is* a debut novel and this author is capable of truly superior writing.Enjoy your reading! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REH11JGV5R6VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXRW4KA#wasThisHelpful","REH11JGV5R6VR","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want a different kind of Regency tale, this is it.  Different in a good way...told from the perspective of a gently-reared woman, raped just a few days after her 15th birthday and thrown out by her father as ""ruined.""  Becky, our heroine.....and she is a heroine.....lived the next nine years with the most courage and dignity I've ever beheld in a novel.  I'm in awe of her.  You may think my opening lines foreshadow a sad, gloomy downer of a story but it's nothing of the sort.  This novel was utterly absorbing and I could not put it down.As reviewer Penny Black says, this is something of a triangle.  The Marquis of Aldridge, a secondary character, is strongly featured during the first half while Hugh, Baron Overton, comes into his own during the latter half.  Hugh is anything but pleasant when he meets Becky, but she's a remarkably strong heroine and Hugh is essentially a kind man.  All three characters are very likable.This novel is well written, the plotting is excellent and the characters are very well developed.  And the historical details!  My word, Ms. Knight didn't put a foot wrong in this regard.  She got the facts straight, and something I really liked....she gave us details but didn't bury us with them.This is a new (to me) author I look forward to following.

"Leave it to Ms. Farrell's brilliant writing to explore a familiar theme and make it hers!  The book description gives you good background so I'll just offer my thoughts.Such a dear, entirely believable, story of two very dear people caught in the throes of a tragic circumstance for Simon, our hero, while Judith, our heroine, is in a tenuous circumstance of her own.  The story evolves as Simon struggles to deal with his blindness and Judith helps him.You wouldn't think this would make for an engrossing read, but it does!  The emotions of both Simon and Judith are explored in depth...the author puts us in their heads.  It's a story that is happy and poignant at the same time, with moments of humor throughout and delightful secondary characters.I was distressed to see a review seriously criticizing this lovely novel because Simon shook, then slapped Judith at a highly emotive time.  Yes, I was briefly shocked too...this was entirely out of character for Simon who was a kind, gentle soul .  But then I realized.....PTSD, anyone?  Ms. Farrell's writing is often subtle...she allows us to think without hitting us over the head with the obvious.  I wish that reviewer had been a little more sensitive to the nuances of that event and I hope you won't be put off by it.  BTW, while Judith did apologize...she instinctively understood...Simon was extremely remorseful.This is another to join my growing collection of Marjorie Farrell novels.  Such an exceptional writer lending such insight and depth to her stories and characters.

"Well, this is the darndest thing!  I've just read a lovely, interesting novel that I enjoyed ~ I really did ~ and I'm sitting here thinking now what? what do I say?  I'm *never* in this fix with a Grace Burrowes novel.  There's usually something that gets me in a real tizzy...often in a good way but not always.  Not this time, though.  This isn't a 'tizzy' kind of novel.  While this novel doesn't approach the brilliance of The Captive (Captive Hearts Book 1), The Traitor (Captive Hearts Book 2), or The Laird (Captive Hearts Book 3), it is nonetheless a very entertaining, interesting story.What this is, is a very well-written novel with some of the lovely passages I think of as trademark Burrowes ~ turns of phrases unique to her.  It is an engaging, sometimes fascinating, story involving sheep (who knew?) and Nita's gift for healing.  It's Nita's use of that gift to all and sundry that has her family bent outta shape.  And here's Tremaine.  Half Scottish, half French nobility, all intriguing.  Orphaned, he grew up in the Highlands and developed his skill as a canny Scot merchant.  He spies Nita and it's pretty much all over for him.  Oh, he'll squirm and struggle but we know he's done for.  And he's on the family's side regarding Nita's medical activities, so trouble could be brewing.It is a story, as well, of the interesting, and entertaining, family dynamics of Nita's irrepressible family.  Some outlying characters are included and all the characters are explored with satisfying depth.  The tale also gives us doses of humor just when we need it.It tells us of the essential helplessness of women of the time.  It touches on the harm done some young boys in the English public schools of the era.  It gives us insight into the appalling medical quackery that often prevailed in the countryside of the era.  Even the changing economy is dealt with.So, you see, there is a great deal here to sink your teeth into besides just a simple romance.  It's anything but simple...but a satisfying love story it definitely is.  And the love scenes are so beautifully sensual.I look forward, with relish, to the other sisters' stories.Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FQ5D8LJYUP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFZ0D8A#wasThisHelpful","R8FQ5D8LJYUP4","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The blurb is haywire btw.  As I said, this was whimsical ~ downright silly in parts ~ and I liked it.  It's told in first person, from 19-year-old Elizabeth's POV.  First person usually gets on my last nerve but it worked here.  I was Elizabeth's confidant and I enjoyed being confided in.  It endeared her to me.Though granddaughters of a duke, Elizabeth and her sisters live quiet, unassuming lives in the country and are treated as commoners by the village folk.  Now the estate on which they've been allowed to live has been inherited by a sophisticated marquess, Lord Dearborne.  ""Nicky"" is the epitome of the London ton ~ and he's also a valued secret agent of the Crown during this time of Napoleon.  He arrives and, thankfully, allows the girls to continue living in their cottage with the housekeeper.  Then, he pretty much ignores the girls...or so Elizabeth thinks.Almost immediately after Secret Agent Nicky's arrival, strange doings begin to occur, what with spies showing up in the area, and Elizabeth is the curious type.  I'll tell you right now that while Elizabeth had plenty of sense, she was naive and she had some off-the-charts TSTL episodes.  Like I said, think ""whimsy.""This was written by the author who gave us The Windflower.  This story, too, is charming, with wonderful dialogue.  I liked it a lot.Don't expect any torrid gasping and heaving here.  There isn't any.

I have only a few comments to add.First ~ For those of you who shy away from angst-laden novels.....and I'm one of you.....I don't think this is a big issue here.  Ms. Farrell leavens the serious and the dire with ample doses of sweetness, humor and just plain interesting.  I was mesmerized and couldn't put the book down.Ms. Farrell's research was so meticulous that she even managed to work into the sub-plot a little known law affecting gambling debts.The writing was utterly seamless, the story was developed carefully, and the growth and change of the characters were portrayed elegantly.  Remarkably, the story was presented within faultless historical context as were the thoughts, attitudes and expressions of the characters.Finally, the love story was believable and ultimately endearing and satisfying.  The sub-plot also gave us another engaging romance that was fun and sweet to read.Brilianty written!Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERFRR926FSF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I53UXLK#wasThisHelpful","R3ERFRR926FSF7","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was an extremely unusual twist here to a familiar theme that made this story do a complete 180 for me...in a good way.  It may have been done before but I'd never seen it and it was a lulu.  It definitely enhanced what could have otherwise been a plain vanilla story.Kate and David were good people who had to deal with David's grasping, conniving step-mother and his worthless half-brother.  This, on top of the nightmares and the unremitting pain David suffered from a serious war wound.  But there were pleasant secondary characters too.  And though this was a quieter, a little more somber story than the Barbour norm, it was interesting.Both Kate and David felt great insecurity with each other's feelings and this led to many misunderstandings which were frequently unresolved due to temper flare-ups.  Endless misunderstandings are a bone of contention with me...I want people to stop mousing around and just spit it out.  The vulnerable state of their emotions, though, made their confusion somewhat more palatable.  Still, they eventually got on my nerves.Otherwise, this was a sweet, interesting story.  It moved at a good clip but carefully enough to develop the plot and the characters.  The plot twist I mentioned earlier, with the changing dynamics between characters, absolutely SAVED this story for me and made it a pretty nice afternoon read.If you don't have my problem with ongoing misunderstandings in a story, I think you may like this a lot.  (I know I can be way too picky:)Enjoy your reading! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DNL0E7ZY0HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LSCKTE#wasThisHelpful","R39DNL0E7ZY0HL","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For sheer entertainment value I'm giving this 5 stars.  I got 5 stars worth of pleasure from it plus the WORLD'S GREATEST PROLOGUE!  No wonder Ms. Michaels laughed as she wrote this.  I wish she'd write more farce...she's really good at it.  And please remember everyone, this IS a farce, meant to be improbable...not the standard soulful, serious HR fare.  This is for fun and it's written so well.I loved Bram and Sophie, both having suffered from their parents' indiscretions.  I loved the secondary characters, those close to the H and h.  The other characters (uncles -ha!) were a hoot.  Loved seeing them squirm.  Then, of course, there was the klepto monkey (to go with the klepto aunt:) and the indiscreet parrot.I particularly liked that, in the end, things even worked out for Cecil and Constance, Bram's and Sophie's parents.  That was wrapped up very nicely and made me feel happy.A reviewer likened this to Heyer's THE GRAND SOPHY and I, too, can see that, sorta.  And I was reminded of Metzger's farces.  BUT.  A big BUT here.....Ms. Michaels wrote this with her own gifted style and this story is unique...and fun.  The sweet love story should satisfy the most hardened critics.  It made me sigh and smile...and I'm a pretty jaded reader.  And what fun it was to see Sophie's joie de vivre on every page!Oh. I said nothing about the plot.  There are plenty of rehashes out there so I'm pretty sure you don't want to yawn your way through my poor effort to retell the story.Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23C4X487A5M11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APZQO0A#wasThisHelpful","R23C4X487A5M11","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I have always thought the questions we ask ourselves more valuable than the answers.""This is a superb sequel to the magnificent RED RED ROSE.  Though, in my opinion, not quite the equal of the first novel, it is nonetheless exceptionally good.  This isn't frothy; it invites the reader to think.  That's not to say it's a heavy tome ~ far from it!  There's humor in all the right places.Ms. Farrell's ineffable writing skill allows us to know the characters so well...to be them...that we find ourselves there, sharing their journey.  Jack, having served behind the lines in Spain during the Peninsular War, now finds himself back home in England with a title, loaded with the debts that came with it and in need of an heiress.  Anne, a pragmatic soul and heiress of a mill owner, is in the market for a title and she has a list!  Unfortunately for Jack, he's the darkhorse and all because of his innate charm.  He's not a rake, he's just naturally charming ~ a lovely man ~ but Anne takes a dim view of his charms.  Poor guy.  But our Jack is indefatigable.Amid the fun of the wooing going on, we see Anne become increasingly knowledgeable of, and involved with, the human element of one of her inherited mills.  She is naturally kind and compassionate and it's interesting to watch the gradual development of her awareness and her conscience regarding her employees.  She is beginning at square one, after all.  She has been sheltered her entire life and the mills have been nothing more than debits and credits to her.  I like Anne.There is much more to this nifty novel than all I'm droning on about.  A lovely, fun romance.  An unexpected and sweet romance between two secondary characters.  The frequent appearances of Val and Elspeth Aston...integral to the story, actually...as well as their happy, comfortable relationship with Val's father.  That made my heart sing.Such a pleasing, satisfying, interesting story!Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PP0EZEQYH3H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRPU5XK#wasThisHelpful","R2PP0EZEQYH3H2","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend told me this is a splendid novel and I'd really enjoy it.  No kidding!  This was one of the best I've read in ages.The setting is mostly Portugal during the Peninsular War.  I like military history and am fascinated by this particular period, so I was raring to go.  What immediately struck me, though, is that the author didn't just paint this with broad strokes ~ she put us ""on the ground"" so to speak.  Such research!  She even makes us see what a close-run thing, politically, this campaign was for Wellington, a circumstance often ignored by authors.Val Aston, our hero, was drawn with such depth and insight, I'm still amazed.  The same was true of Elspeth, our heroine, even though there was less space devoted to her.  Remarkable.  This was true, as well, of the secondary characters...even Val's dead mother.  I loved the good ones and hated the villain.  There was a great deal of dialogue which I liked very much.  The author didn't take the easy path and just tell us.The love story evolved quietly and beautifully.  I was touched by Elspeth's tender understanding of Val during their first love scene.  She instinctively knew Val was at the end of his tether.Ms. Farrell managed to poignantly and sensitively portray Val's emotional struggles with his bastardy.  She also conveyed the horrors of public schools of the era as well as the dire plight of homosexuals of the time.  These portrayals in no way detracted from the story.  Rather, they added to it ~ they were related in a spare, matter-of-fact way.Timing.  I rarely mention this in a review but Ms. Farrell's timing in this story was exceptional.  Had a certain event occurred during very late pages of the story, I may have been in a funk for a week.  As it was written though, I lived, got through it and later came to understand the reasoning for it.Beautifully written, wonderful story.Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO214RKGV0ER2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNZ91FS#wasThisHelpful","RO214RKGV0ER2","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her zeal to portray the horrors and inequities of the justice system of the period ~ which was well done ~ a salient fact was overlooked that impacted the entire romance.Much, much, much was made of the fact that a marriage between  Lucy, the governess, and Lord Granville would destroy him socially and politically.  What nonsense.  It clearly states in the opening chapters that her late father was a baron.  Though impoverished, he was nonetheless a Peer of the Realm.  So that whole ""I'm in service and would ruin your life"" won't wash.  Granville was an earl, very wealthy, influential and she was a baron's daughter.  Their marriage would have been gossip, maybe, for about a week and that would have been the end of it.  So the whole theme of the star-crossed lovers falls apart at the outset.  Actually, even had she not been a baron's daughter, it would have worked out.  Peers married commoners, they married mistresses, life went on and they were still invited to ton parties.The subject of parental neglect by the nobility was also a pervading theme.  But I'd like to have met the governess who gave her noble employer a talking-to and wasn't out the door in five minutes.  Well, Lucy did it!  ...I can suspend disbelief just so much.  Had the writing been more adroitly done, this part of the story may have been more successful.Granville had no spine.  On the one hand, we're told what an arrogant nobleman he is.  On the other, he repeatedly craters to his witch of a mother.  He even bowed to the governess's demands about his children.  Lucy's brother, William (now a baron, though that's overlooked) is a worthless plague on humanity but all Lucy and her sister see is the angelic child he was ~ NOT the countless lives he destroyed.  And they're supposedly so *concerned* about injustices done to ordinary folk.Several parts of this were heavy, the writing was ponderous, and the plot.....well, I've already given my opinion of that.  The errors in the epilogue were addressed by the author elsewhere, so they get a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQDCADB16X4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007U61NXA#wasThisHelpful","R1DQDCADB16X4H","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not happy about the company I'm in with my rating, but I'm an actual reader and this is truly a 5-star novel for me.  Wonderful story.  One I will enjoy rereading.  Given my opinion of the story, it would be unfair to award fewer stars.Gently born, Daisy had been through hell from a very young age.  Her father sold her to a brute and she was terrified of the marital act.  Sure can't blame her.  I saw a review criticizing her dogged determination to marry Geoff.  I don't.  He was the only man who had ever been kind to her and in her naivete, she thought he was too old to want intimate relations with her.  She would feel safe.  That was both laughable and pitiful.  Even after having been brutalized for years, Daisy was such an innocent soul.I also saw a remark about Daisy's unruly temper.  Well, I didn't see any evidence of Daisy pitching fits.  She was spirited and had gumption.  Had she not had those qualities, she wouldn't have survived.  And her vulnerability was all too evident throughout the story.And then there's delightful Leland ~ a viscount with a mother from hell.  His childhood hadn't been a walk in the park, either.  He covered his insecurities with charm and wit.  And, boy! was he a master of both...and a genuinely nice man.Without rambling on and poorly retelling a lovely, lovely story, I will say the seduction scene was the most sensual and beautiful I have ever read.  I once read another I thought was glorious.  This tops even that.This is a beautifully written story with grand, well-developed characters and an absorbing plot.  Yes, there was a villain and I saw a remark about how that's been done to death.  Well, yes, and haven't most plot devices?  I thought it was necessary here.I'm shocked that there aren't scads of reviews of this deserving novel.  I hope you won't be put off by the lukewarm reviews you read here.  This is a grand story and I loved it.Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFXIU93O0D3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VA1PLG#wasThisHelpful","R1YFXIU93O0D3N","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently read Gypsy Lover, the only Layton novel I'd never read and thoroughly enjoyed it.  A fun, sweet story, beautifully written, of course.  Naturally, I had to immediately reread THE RETURN OF THE EARL to refresh my memory of how the saga had begun.I'm very sorry to say this did not reflect the Edith Layton to which I'm accustomed.  The plot waffled, the dialogue seldom had the trademark Layton crispness.  There was just no zip to the story.  There may have been personal matters responsible for the letdown in quality.  I don't know.  It's puzzling.Despite all that, I *am* glad I read it because it does set the stage for the 4-book series and it *is* an okay novel.Enjoy your reading! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34F54VS6G0A73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V507EI#wasThisHelpful","R34F54VS6G0A73","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some strange reason, I kept steering clear of this novel.  I think the title just conjured up ridiculousness to me.  What a mistake!  This proved to be an interesting and an entertaining story.Meg is on a two-week hiatus from her job as companion to a young twit who has just run off.  While supposedly staying with her old governess, Meg is actually trying to track down the girl so Meg can at least salvage a reference from her employer.  Along the way, she encounters Daffyd who has been commissioned to the same purpose by his aristocratic mother who is the nitwit's godmother.Much of the story encompasses their journey, their growing friendship, admiration and respect for each other.  We spend a night at a gypsy encampment with Daffyd's grandmother and half-brother.  Later, we pause at the grand estate of Daffyd's other half-brother, an aristocrat through and through.  Eventually, we arrive at the London home of Geoffrey, the Earl of Egremont.  Such a good, kind man and Daffyd's ""father of his heart"".I am so appreciative of Edith Layton's attention to historical detail and the astonishing degree of accuracy she accomplished.  Just consider ~ she didn't have the benefit of the internet.....her research was done with books and documents.  Makes me appreciate her work that much more.Anyway, I'm glad I read this.  Really an entertaining, non-angsty story with likable characters.This is Book 3 of the series.

"This is my favorite novel by Edith Layton.  It is a beautiful love story, carefully developed throughout the story.  FYI this story is the exact opposite of THE DUKE'S WAGER and THE DISDAINFUL MARQUIS.  Not remotely similar.  Here we have an honorable hero...a good man.After a horrible first marriage, Morgan didn't care for a repeat.  But he did need to select an heir from among three distant cousins.  The three were invited to Lyonshall to become acquainted and to eventually be interviewed by him and a selection made.Among the three was Anthony, a radical young twerp, accompanied by his older cousin, Elizabeth.  Gently bred, the two lived in poverty~Elizabeth worked in a millinery shop.  Their family scraped together the means to outfit Elizabeth and Anthony as aristocrats, a pretense that bothered honorable Elizabeth.The other two candidates were dour Richard and a chubby youngster, Owen, brought by his mother, Isabel.  Though on the fringe of society, Isabel was a schemer and all but a lightskirt.  The other two people who made up this houseparty was Lord Beverly, Morgan's lifelong best friend (I loved Bev) and a late, unexpected arrival, Lord Kingston, who had become Morgan's friend when they were both hospitalized during the Napoleonic Wars.Heavens, this review is just dry as dust and I LOVED the story!  Maybe I should have just left it at a ""beautiful love story.""  It was; it was romantic; there was scheming (don't forget Isabel;) there was excitement; there was villainy; there was pathos.  There was a sublime conversation between Morgan and Elizabeth together with some beautifully-written, heartrending passages.This is, by far, my favorite Layton novel, very emotional and romantic.  I apologize for such a dud of a review.Enjoy your reading! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F67X03N5VO5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWILEWS#wasThisHelpful","R1F67X03N5VO5H","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I'd found a 'different' kind of Regency, and the settings and characters are out of the ordinary.  But I was ultimately disappointed.The h behaved like a dimwit.  Can't blame the H when he had his way with our round-heeled Sophie, then only offered to provide for any consequences.  After all, he hadn't professed love ~ that was all TSTL Sophie.There were several plot twists ~ enough that I sometimes lost track of the plot.  I think ""disjointed"" is the word.  It was as if the author stopped writing and returned to it with a passage irrelevant to the previous one.Funny.  When I first read this long ago, it seemed pretty fair.  Times change.

"Ms. Lynne can sure tell a story and the mystery kept me guessing all the way to the big denouement.  The characters were developed well and the progression of the romance was nicely written.  A little too much harping on his being a beast but that was okay.Unfortunately, my enjoyment was tempered by historical errors that were distracting.  In my opinion, an author who writes a period novel should know the people of that time and place.  Dukes are not my lorded; gentlemen always wore waistcoats, most definitely to formal affairs; the misquote of Shakespeare was coined several years after the time of the story; and then came the last straw ~ ""slacks"".  Just a few minutes' research could have made all the difference.Today's authors have the internet so I feel cheated when they can't be bothered to even google.

"These are a man's memories, not a novel or a scholarly tome.  So how can I presume to ""review"" such a work except to tell you what the book gave me?  I've read a diary of one who was crushed in the Warsaw ghetto but this account is the first I've read by someone who survived it and also lived on the ""Aryan"" side.One reviewer described this as chilling and I must disagree.  I found it tragic and haunting.  Brutes can be found everywhere.  What was chilling to me were the managerial minds that calmly, pragmatically, dispassionately planned the murders of millions upon millions of fellow human beings.  Jews, of course, were their first focus, along with gypsies and homosexuals.  But don't forget, had the Nazis defeated the Soviet Union, millions of Slavs would have also been in the crosshairs for extermination.  So it's those average-looking men who planned this in meticulous detail who are chilling to me.  Particularly horrifying is that their actions couldn't even be explained by madness.  No, most led perfectly ordinary lives ""outside the office.""This is certainly a testament to Dr. Reicher's courage, determination and sound common sense.  And even though the Reichers lived this for six terrifying years, it's impossible for me to relate.  I don't think I'd have the fortitude to live in constant terror for all those years with nerves drawn taut every second, suffering constant abuse.  But the Reichers did it.These memoirs are also unique in that Dr. Reicher first experienced the Lodz ghetto.  He was also acutely aware of the pogroms *after* the war perpetrated against the pitifully few survivors who had already lived through hell.Dr. Reicher made a thought-provoking point..that there were three groups of people ~ a small group of the vicious, a large group of 'neutrals' who didn't want to become involved, and a small group who helped.  And they were from every strata of society.  This made me pose the question to myself ~ in which group would I fall?  I know I wouldn't be among the vicious but would I have had the moral and physical courage to be a helper?  These memoirs make you think.  Not an easy read but worthwhile.  If he could live it, I can read about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G46V5BL2JPWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHOSTU6#wasThisHelpful","R3G46V5BL2JPWX","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Metzger threw us a curve in this one.  A good one.Of course, ""Stony"" didn't want to marry.  He couldn't afford to and he refused to marry a girl for her dowry. Good for him!

"The premise of this story was good but there a lot of words that didn't accomplish much...didn't move the story along or help the characters.Julian was a marvelous letter writer and he and Viola had often corresponded.  How nice if there had been snippets of his ""beautiful letters"" throughout the story to lend some insight into Julian, the man.  Instead, he was generally a wooden character...not always, but generally.  We knew his three wives had died but we didn't know how until the middle of the story.  When we learned the causes, it seemed nonsensical that he should be  living under a mantle of guilt and be the subject of superstitious and malevolent gossip.  He was frequently grumpy.We didn't know a whole lot about Viola, either.  She had three brothers, she worked on her father's farm until he grew rich.  She had been engaged and then she wasn't.  It wasn't until later in the story that we learned why.  She was vivacious.That's about it for the characters.  The story crept along during the first half though the pace did pick up midway.  The story would have been much shorter with tighter prose.  The pace would have benefited, as well.  There were some laughable anachronisms, two or three yanked me out of the story ~ ""har-di-har"", ?  ""He took off his belt...""  Men of that class wore braces under their waistcoats...not belts.  He would have torn off a strip of her petticoat in that circumstance.  I know I'm yammering and moaning about this but it bothers me when an author isn't very well acquainted with the period and place about which she's writing.***SPOILER***I loved the epilogue!

Secret childhood friends, boy and girl fall in love, can't marry because boy's father is a coal merchant and girl's father is an earl.There was no real romance.  The flashbacks finally got on my nerves.  The ""love"" scene was gross.  There was a spin near the end that made the plot *slightly* different.  Yawn.I can generally count on Balogh but I swear she churned this out over her morning coffee (one cup.)It was short:)","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JATWP1HJJW38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XAW3NC#wasThisHelpful","R3JATWP1HJJW38","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alone, Jane is penniless and shunned by society due to deplorable actions by her late father.  Soon to be homeless, she has no desirable choices left.  Now, Benjamin, a viscount, fashionable member of the ton and secret agent of the Crown, has offered a solution to Jane's thorny problems.  She will ""die"", reemerge as her French cousin, Lillilanne, and help the Crown's secret committee unmask the traitor who has stolen two vital dossiers.As crazy as this all sounds, it actually made sense and I thoroughly enjoyed 89% of the story ~ sufficiently glued that I stayed up until 3AM reading.  The story is very well written.  The plot, and sub-plots, had me gasping and turning pages.  Handsome Benjamin was a tortured hero.  There was humor.  I enjoyed the chapter headings that were snippets of Fordyce's Sermons to Young Women.  ""Lillianne"" played her role to perfection.  There was mystery.  There was a sweet, slowly-developing love story.  I absolutely loved the story to the 89% point.If you can put your disbelief completely out to pasture, you should enjoy the last 11%.  I won't ruin what may be a wonderful reading experience for you by adding a spoiler here.  I'll add that in a comment below.For your full reading pleasure of this novel, I strongly recommend that you first read the preceding story, Once Upon a Wager (Crimson Romance).Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTPZ0TN57WBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFWHFSE#wasThisHelpful","RSTPZ0TN57WBD","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a happy surprise for me.  After reviewing my first Stuart novel which was a bad experience,  a reader suggested that I may enjoy the House of Rohan series.  Well, a long while later I sucked it up and read this one, SHAMELESS, and it was a darn good novel!  Naturally, I began with Book 4, not Book 1.  Maybe I lost something, I dunno, it seemed like a good standalone to me.  At any rate, I didn't see any alarming gaps that left me in left field.Interesting, reading reviews of some who had read earlier books in this series and were disappointed in this one as a result.  Maybe I began with the right one, after all, because I liked this novel.Widowed twice, Benedick wasn't a rake (but he was a hunky alpha:)  he was in London for a little sex (he'd been without for several months,) and to find a biddable, uninteresting wife who could produce an heir and then fade into the wallpaper.  Benedick was in for the surprise of his life when a lovely virago named Melisande sailed in to retrieve the demirep he had summoned.  Melisande was a wealthy widow who was on a mission to save soiled doves.This story moved at a sprightly pace, there was wit and I really liked the H and h.  The plot revolved around a take on the old Hellfire Club and it was interesting.  Of course, near the end it devolved into some unbelievable Mrs. Radcliffe-ish scenes but I went with the excitement.I was interested in the sketch of Brandon and Emma.  Hope to read their story.Enjoy your reading! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SIJ01TGZCGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z2I5AG#wasThisHelpful","R34SIJ01TGZCGY","A1WVORERMA7G18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WVORERMA7G18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used about four bottles of this product and I still have reservations about it's quality. One bottle started to turn to a lighter color part way through and one bottle turned almost clear, by the time there was 1/3 left. My research on Colloidal Silver tells me that color change is improperly suspended silver and when it does that, the product becomes less effective or not effective at all. The key is the small silver particles being suspended in the liquid, for proper absorption in your body, when taken.The same thing will happen to Colloidal Silver if it freezes. It will turn clear and will appear a little cloudy at the bottom. When that happens.... the bottle is Ruined! This MediSIVER  may be less costly, but it has never happened to the 10 or so bottles of MesoSilver  20 ppm Colloidal Silver, 500 mL, which I have taken. I have chronic Candida and Colloidal Silver seems to be the best treatment for it. I have become resistant to many of the other products and treatments for Candida.There are other good quality Colloidal Silver products out there, just be careful and do not buy it if the bottle is tinted as it is most likely and impostor (Silver Ions). Also, do not attempt to make it at home with an Ion Generator. That is also Silver Ions, and is not nearly as effective.UPDATE 10/01/15: I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TODAY.... One should avoid taking the silver with a metal spoon, since metal causes the silver ions to lose their positive charge, rendering them worthless for holistic purposes. I have also raised my rating to four stars, as I have been having better results with the product quality, after 15+ bottles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRDEI54S2OS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB0UYLY#wasThisHelpful","RMRDEI54S2OS4","A38FV08N9Z4BD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38FV08N9Z4BD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed reading the continuation of Ceony's story. I'm enjoying the magic in this series, and it was fun learning more about the different types of magic in this world. The plot moved along well without the draggy tendencies of the first book in the series, and we dug a little deeper into the characters.The biggest negative for me were a couple places where Ceony makes some very irrational decisions. It's a standard in this type of book that the hero has to face down her enemy alone. This is convincing when there's no help around. It's not convincing when there's a whole room of master magicians just behind a closed door and the hero randomly decides now would be a good time to go tackle the evil magician solo. I like Ceony's character generally, but that moment didn't work for me.Overall, I'd recommend this if you enjoy light fantasy. Do start with the first book in the series, though--this one requires you to read it in order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KC64U4UMB23Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K89FZLW#wasThisHelpful","R2KC64U4UMB23Z","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my Fitbit about 4 weeks now and am loving it.The Fitbit Zip is a step up from a basic pedometer. I couldn't justify one of the pricier options, but I liked that the Fitbit zip automatically updates and could be synced with my Weight Watchers account. It's helping me accurately track my activity level and motivating me to be more active.I've found the Zip to be pretty accurate in counting steps--somewhat dishearteningly, since I learned pretty quickly that I had been grossly underestimating my activity level. It's accurate on my exerglider and just walking around the house. A 45 minute Zumba workout measures at about 4000 steps, which seems about right to me.I had a little trouble initially getting the Zip to sync with my WeightWatchers account, but after the software downloaded an update it works fine. You do have to have a certain baseline of activity to earn activity points, so it takes a while for points to show up. If I Zumba first thing the morning my activity points don't track right away, but by the end of the day I'll have 3 points added to my account. It appears to me I have to have in the neighborhood of 5000 steps before activity points start showing up.This is a nice tool and it's motivating me to stay active. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a basic activity tracker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7M5MWEITTBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095PZHZE#wasThisHelpful","R1T7M5MWEITTBT","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Juliet Marillier's books are an auto-buy for me, and her latest title didn't disappoint. I could hardly put down Dreamer's Pool and I'm looking forward to seeing what she does with this series.Dreamer's Pool introduces us to Blackthorn, a prisoner bent on revenge. She's spared from the executioner by a visitor with a surprising offer: serve him for seven years and live. But there are conditions--including leaving her dreams of vengeance behind.Dreamer's Pool follows Blackthorn, Grim--Blackthorn's protector and friend, and Prince Oram. The story has some romance, but focuses mostly on Blackthorn and Grim's journey and the mystery that they must work with the prince to unravel. Nothing is ever simple when the fae meddle with the lives of humankind.I really enjoyed this book. The viewpoint characters all have distinct, interesting voices. The setting is interesting, and the plot is well-paced. If you've read any of Mette Ives Harrison's books you may see the twist coming, but Marillier puts her own spin on it.Readers who are familiar with Marillier's more recent books such as Wildwood Dancing and the Caller series should note that this is not a YA title. With Blackthorn and Grim Marillier returns to adult fantasy. Dreamer's Pool has a darker tone more reminiscent of the original Sevenwaters Trilogy. But it's a thoroughly enjoyable book I'd recommend to any adult fantasy lover. I'm looking forward to more adventures in Marillier's new world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XLYWTSSRWAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIJKKC#wasThisHelpful","R3XLYWTSSRWAQ","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the first book in this series and had really looked forward to this one. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I had hoped.In Destined for Doon Kenna is called back to Doon to help her best friend overcome a new threat to the kingdom: a black plague that only Kenna can see. But returning to help Vee also means Kenna has to face Duncan--the prince with whom she shares a calling and chose to leave behind.All that is an interesting set up, but the book failed to deliver for me. The threat of the black fungus/plague never seemed that threatening to me--partly because of Kenna and Vee's attitudes. ""A black fungus is surrounding the kingdom and may turn us all into zombies? Let's paint our nails and have a party!"" I get the whole ""celebrating life"" idea, but the two main characters came of as immature and superficial. The danger took back seat to the boy drama in this book, and the spiritual themes of forgiveness seemed shoehorned in.Then there was all the kissing. There's a lot of heavy kissing in this book--some between an engaged couple; some between Duncan and Kenna. One scene involves passionate kissing between two characters, one of whom is drunk. Kenna is not shy about checking out Duncan's body (even salivating over his belly button? really?) and the guys comment on the girls' tight pants, etc. Most YA novels these days do include some romance and sexuality, but the detail in the descriptions is more than I would be comfortable with a younger teen reading. Readers should also note that while this book is put out by a Zondervan imprint (Zondervan is one of the largest Christian publishers) and is carried at least in the online catalogs for several Christian bookstores, the romance scenes in this series go beyond what I would expect to see in a Christian YA novel--or most Christian fiction, for that matter.Destined for Doon is okay, but I was disappointed in this second book of the series. Readers should also note that the book ends on a pretty serious cliffhanger. If cliffhangers bother you, you might want to wait until the third book comes out next year before reading this one. It's okay, but I had expected more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32RWHTVNBG3F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2PFY5G#wasThisHelpful","R32RWHTVNBG3F2","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've really enjoyed this series, and I enjoyed reading this final book. And yet, I still was a little disappointed by the Blood of Olympus.In some ways it's classic Riordan. Heroes, gods, limited time quest, the world in danger. Check. Heroes of Olympus follows both the 7 demigods quest to stop the giants and Reyna's quest to return the Athena statue to Camp Half-Blood. There's plenty of adventure, humor, and a few dashes of romance along the way. It's a fun read in many ways.So, why was I disappointed?  I missed Percy, for one thing. Point of view characters in this book are Jason, Piper, Reyna, Nico, and Leo. I understand to some degree why Riordan made the narrative choices that he did, but in this final book it would have been nice to hear from Percy and Annabeth one more time.I also felt that the book shied away from showing the real cost of war. In the Last Olympian there were some losses and deaths that we felt greatly because we had come to care about the characters. We don't see that as much in Blood of Olympus. Yeah, some characters die--mostly people we don't like. And the loss of one of the seven at the end is so heavily telegraphed that we know several chapters ahead who is going to die, why they are going to die, and what the likely escape clause will be. Sacrifice loses its power when you know there's a way out. Those moments in the Last Olympian where we linger and feel the pain, the moments when characters have to make real, hard choices--that's missing.Another thing I felt Riordan let drop in this book was the issue of Percy's fatal flaw. It's been mentioned consistently throughout the series, but it never came down to that pivotal moment in this book where Percy had to choose the greater good over a friend. I think that's something we may have lost out on by not having a chapter in Percy's viewpoint.So it's a fun book.  We get an entertaining adventure and the expected (very couple-y) happy ending. There's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it mention of Riordan's next series. (Look at the title of his next book if you did miss it). If you've read this far with Percy, absolutely finish it up.  It's a good book. But it's not the book it could have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0MCZQM8X6IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRVH3V6#wasThisHelpful","R2G0MCZQM8X6IC","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vogue needs to hire some new developers.I liked the theory of this app.  Download the free app, then purchase the issues you want--including a good list of back issues.  The Winter 2010 issue of Vogue Knitting is included as a free sample with the app.The pictures look nice and I enjoyed browsing but the app is lacking functionality. As others have noted, there's no page slider.  There's also no way to bookmark pages or make notes. This is particularly annoying because the app sets the magazine back to the cover everytime you reopen the application, forcing you to flip back through every page of the magazine to find your place.  This is annoying enough when you're just browsing the magazine, but I  can't imagine trying to actually knit from one of the patterns--which are always at the back--and having to flip through the publication every time I wanted to get to the pattern.  There are a few hyperlinks that will take you to a 360 view of featured patterns, but there's no way to print a pattern. Basically all this app is good for is browsing the magazine in one sitting. I won't be purchasing any additional issues digitally until they improve the functionality.

"This one has been in my to-read pile for a while and I finally got to it. Honestly, I hadn't picked it up sooner because I felt like I've already read some other similar books (like Brandilyn Collins Double Blind or A Heartbeat Away by Harry Kraus). But when I finally got to Seagrass Pier I was pleased to find that Coble has put a fresh spin on a somewhat familiar plot.This is an enjoyable, suspenseful read with multiple plot threads that keep you turning pages. The romance is nice, and I liked Elin's character. Not one that's going on my favorite's list, but it was a enjoyable book.I think where Seagrass Pier lost points for me was largely in the beginning.  The plot plunges you right in with not much of an introduction to Elin or her situation. Coble does a good job of introducing Elin's backstory, but it wasn't enough for my suspicion of disbelief to kick in regarding the whole concept of transplants and cellular memory. Discovering Elin's new memories along with her instead of having it presented as a fait accompli would have helped in that regard. I also was a little thrown by the diary entries being written in third person. Who writes in their diary in third person? That may be a bit nit-picky, but it was enough to pull me out of the book.If you've enjoyed Coble's other books you'll probably enjoy Seagrass Pier. Recommended to readers who enjoy Christian suspense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGZZ0OO6ECMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5QX17U#wasThisHelpful","RWGZZ0OO6ECMA","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this conclusion to the Shadowfell series Neryn's quest for the freedom of Alban takes her to the perilous heart of the king's court. As the Midsummer battle approaches, Neryn still must find two more guardians to complete her training--and grapple with the presence of another Caller.Juliet Marillier is one of my favorite authors, and I've enjoyed reading this series. Neryn has costly choices to make, but I didn't find the series as dark as some of her others (like the original Sevenwaters trilogy, for example). Neryn and her allies are concerned with doing the right thing the right way. Neryn's grappling with her conscience and commitment to acting with honor adds depth to the books. I also appreciated that the villains aren't entirely drawn with one note--there are shades of complexity here.The Shadowfell books are suitable for YA readers, though I think Marillier's adult fans will still enjoy the series. I've enjoyed reading this series and will probably be returning to Neyrn's journey again. I'd recommend them to readers who enjoy historical fantasy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DH5GTNTHOI48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1IOBA2#wasThisHelpful","R2DH5GTNTHOI48","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I enjoyed reading The Paper Magician. I liked the world building and the concept of using paper as a base for magic. I hadn't seen a fantasy novel done in quite this way before, and I enjoyed exploring paper magic along with Ceony. I also liked the book's tone and enjoyed Ceony as a character.I did think the pacing was a bit off.  The beginning of the book proceeded nicely, but I was caught off guard when the villain made her appearance. Often in this type of book we get a couple beats where the villain threatens the hero, but is thwarted. These scenes usually establish that the villain really is a bad guy and that the hero still has a lot to learn, etc. When the villain showed up I expected that type of beat in the novel, but we got thrust into the final showdown. To me that made that section feel rushed and the following section seemed to drag.Despite the pacing, there's still plenty to enjoy about this book. If you enjoy fantasy it's worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30P94WYBU64R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVF7OL0#wasThisHelpful","R30P94WYBU64R9","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to go wrong with shrinky dinks. There's something about watching the plastic shrink up in the oven that kids love. Most of the kits I've seen lately are more girl themed, though.  Jewelry making, lots of flowers, butterflies, etc. I wanted to find a kit that my son and nephew would enjoy and was excited to find this one. The kit includes your standard shrinky dinks, but also includes brads and pipe cleaners you can use to build 3D monsters with moveable arms or eyeballs hanging off their heads.

"Positives first:  this is a very nice easel.  I like that there is a paper cutter included (sealed so no little fingers can get to it).  It makes tearing the paper off of the paper roll very easy.  I wish the white board was magnetic, but even without that it's a very nice piece that sparks open-ended creative play.The whiteboard and chalkboard seem to be decent quality, though the wood does seem very light.One important note on assembly:  Both the chalkboard and whiteboard have ""TOP"" clearly labeled on the backside of the board so you know how to rotate the board so that the holes line up.  So far so good, except that on ours the chalkboard was mislabeled.  The side labeled ""top"" actually had to go on the bottom.  Not a big problem once we figured out we just had to spin the board around, but we almost broke the thing trying to get it to fit before we figured that out.

I was really disappointed with the wand, though.  The wand we received had a cardboard handle with the butterfly on top attached only by a couple of thin wires stuck inside the cardboard tube.  My two-year old carried it trick-or-treating and the butterfly fell off as we were crossing the 4 lane highway in front of our house.  For the price I wasn't expecting it to last for years, but I did think it would survive a gust of wind for at least one night.

"I'm still a little in shock that I didn't like this book.Dee Henderson is one of my all-time favorite authors.  Danger in the Shadows, the O'Malley series, The Witness--I've read everything she's written and loved it.  Until now.Unspoken, Henderson's latest, is the story of Bryce Bishop and Charlotte Graham. Bryce is a Chicago coin dealer who is starting to get just a little bored with his successful business.  Charlotte shatters that boredom one evening with an unusual method of enlisting Bryce's help with selling the rare coins from her grandfather's estate.  As Bryce spends time with Charlotte, the secrets of her past begin to come out.  Bryce begins to realize that God may have brought them together and that he may be a bigger part of the solution to Charlotte's dilemma than she had originally planned.This book really did not work for me.  The plot dragged, I never connected with the main characters, and I felt the conclusion didn't make sense.  Here are the three major reasons I didn't like the book:*Bloated exposition.  The first 200 pages are about coins.  Seriously.  I applaud the author for doing her research, but I'm not that into rare coins.  There's too much jargon and too much detail.  I got tired of hearing all the details about every new batch of coins, how much they were worth, and how they were going to sell them.  I can't even say that I learned anything about coins because there was never an explanation of the terms or jargon.*Never heard Charlotte's voice.  One of the things I loved about Henderson's earlier books was getting to know characters like Sara, Kate, and Shari.  There were a few scenes from Charlotte's point of view in this book, but we never got inside her head.  I suppose this was so her secrets could be revealed like the bombshells they're supposed to be, but it left me feeling disengaged from the book.*Lack of suspense.  Henderson is known as a romantic suspense writer.  This book was really lacking in that area to me.  I could understand Charlotte dealing with trauma from her past experiences, but it never seemed that she or Bryce were in any danger that kept me turning pages.  Additionally, the main device for moving the plot forward seemed to be Charlotte telling Bryce something she had kept secret.  That's fine, but sometimes I didn't see why she felt she had to keep silent about some of the details.  There were several times when other characters said ""Oh, well, I understand why she never talked about that.""  I kept thinking ""I don't--would you explain it, please?""I was disappointed with this book.

"With more than 90 books under her belt, Tracie Peterson is one of the most prolific authors in the Christian Fiction market.  Some of her novels I've loved; some of them are just okay.  The Miner's Lady, the latest in Peterson's Land of Shining Water series, falls in the ""just okay"" category.The Miner's Lady is set in the mining town of Ely, Minnesota and revolves around a family of Italian miners,the Calcaros. The Calcaros have been feuding for generations with another local family, the Panettas.When Isabel Calcaro falls in love with Orlando Panetta, Isabel's older sister, Chantel, knows nothing good will come of it.  But as her family tries to end the feud, Chantel also finds herself drawn to Orlando's older brother, Dante Panetta.  Will the families be able to make piece, or will their young love be shattered by tragedy?This book was okay, but there wasn't really anything there that made it stand out from the crowd.  Chantel seems too perfect, and I never got a clear picture of Dante's character in my mind.  The romance between them seems sudden. I also felt that there were too many plotlines going on in the book.  There's Isabel's romance with Orlando and the question of whether they can escape Orlando's father's wrath.  Then there's Chantel's relationship with Dante and the feud between the two families. That seems to have been enough to deal with, but then there's also a subplot dealing with Chantel's brother Marco and his drinking and gambling that doesn't really seem to have anything to do with the rest of the book. There's a thread where the local bar owner shows some interest in Chantal that borders on threatening, but that thread is never developed.  I just never felt a strong sense of tension as the story progressed.  It just kind of moves along until we get to the fairly predictable conclusion. Peterson fans will probably enjoy this story, but it's not one I'm going to hang on to.  Three stars.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a review.

"A lot of the Christian fiction market starts to run together after a while.  It's always nice when you come across something that feels fresh.  The Gothic feel and Victorian intrigue make this book stand apart from the crowd.  If you want something a little different to read, Born of Persuasion is worth a look.The characters are always what draw me to a book, and Jessica Dotta does a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life.  Julia is complex and well-rounded, and the large cast of supporting characters is also well drawn.  Combine that with an intriguing plot, the solid  prose, and well-researched historical setting and you have a winner.One of the unique things about this book is that Julia is an avowed atheist--something you don't find often in Christian fiction books, particularly in historical fiction.  The author did a good job of exploring the reasons behind her belief and showing how that backstory complicates her relationships.  Julia's gradual softening toward faith over the course of the novel is also well done.

"When we get it right church can be a glorious thing.  But when we get it wrong, church can also be a place of wounding.  Wounds left by the people of God can take a long time to heal.In her new book, Wounded by God's People, Anne Graham Lotz uses the story of Hagar to show us how we can find healing in an encounter with God.  In a book both deeply personal and thoroughly biblical, Lotz interweaves the story of Hagar with her own stories of deep wounding.  Her tone is warm, but also gently confronting as she reminds the reader about the dangers of bitterness and the ultimate need to forgive.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has experienced church hurt.  Pastor's wives and other church leaders who have been wounded by their congregations may find this book a helpful and encouraging read.  It's definitely one to keep on the shelf.I received  a free copy of this book from the publisher via Booksneeze.  All thoughts and feelings expressed are my own.

"Last year I read and loved Spiritual Warfare for Women: Winning the Battle for Your Home, Family, and Friends by Leighann McCoy.  When I saw her new book, A Woman' Guide to Hearing God's Voice I jumped at the chance to review it.  It's a good book, though  it's not what I was expecting exactly.In this case the subtitle gives you a better picture of what the book is about than the title:  finding direction and peace through the struggles of life.  The book is not really about learning to hear God's voice as much as it is learning to hear from God in difficult times.  McCoy shares lessons she has learned through her struggle with cancer and family stress interwoven with what Scripture has to teach us about suffering.While disappointed that the book wasn't what I expected, I still appreciated several of the lessons McCoy draws out in this book.  I thought her sections on wrestling with God and the idea of letting God define good were well done.  She also draws comfort from understanding God's sovereignty; if God has allowed this season then God is also at work finding you a way through it.Each chapter has a short ""treasure hunt"" section at the end including personal reflection and discussion questions.  The appendix includes resources for helping you learn to tell ""your story for God's glory"" and finding ways  to share that story.

"This is an action packed read.  The book starts off following Molly and Zack as they try to escape the Great Chicago Fire.  The dramatic opening definitely caught my attention and helped keep me engaged as the backtracked six days in time to explore the events that led up to the fire.Having the book set around the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire kept the book fresh for me.  We tend to see a lot of Civil War and Western/Pioneer historicals in the Christian Fiction genre--this was the first book I remember set around this particular event.  I also appreciated that Molly had a unique occupation:  a watchmaker.  That also helped set this book apart.More than that though, I appreciated this book for the solid writing, action packed plot, and well-developed characters.  I liked the twists and turns of Molly and Zack's romance--even if I wanted to shake her a  few times for being so slow to trust.  The minor characters also add depth and interest to the story.  Faith issues are interwoven, but not in an overwhelming or preachy way.  Into the Whirlwind is another solid piece of work from Elizabeth Camden.

"I really enjoyed this book. I'm always up for a good mystery, and this one stood out from the crowd.  The period setting was nice, and I enjoyed the snappy dialogue and playful romance.  I had never heard of Father Knox or his 10 rules of murder before, but it was fun to see how the author cheerfully manages to break all ten in a single book.

"There are certain plots that Christian fiction writers return to over and over again.  A Noble Groom uses one of the most popular---a young woman loses her husband, finds herself in a financially precarious position, and the hero rides to the rescue before they fall in love and overcome all obstacles to living happily-ever-after.  Two things set this book apart from the crowd, however:  the solid writing and the strength of the characterization.I really enjoyed Annalissa's character.  Even in what seems like a hopeless situation she remains strong.  I like the way her beloved fairy tales show that she hasn't given up on her dreams.  I also appreciated Carl's character.  His creativity and courage make him an interesting character.  I also liked that while the hard work of the farm is new to him, he's not portrayed as inept. He has to learn, but he's willing to work hard so he can help Annalissa to the best of his ability.  The romance between them is sweet and nicely developed, and the final action scene is a natural progression from the rest of the book--not something that comes out of the blue.I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical fiction.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.

"We bought this hoping to extend the life of our old mattress a little while longer while we save up for the mattress we really want.Positives first--this topper does help us get better sleep.  Before we installed the topper I had been tossing and turning quite a bit at night. I'm sleeping better with the topper and often wake up in the same position I went to sleep. I didn't have high expectations for motion isolation since we just put this on top of our old mattress, but it does seem to help.  I'm not waking up every time my husband rolls over anymore.  I've had less trouble with back pain since we began using the topper, and I feel like it's a comfortable level of firmness.  It feels very firm when you first lay down on it, but if you lay there a moment you can feel the material conforming to your body.  It does help give a very comfortable sleep.Negatives--the off-gassing with this was really bad. We kept it out for three full days before putting it on the mattress, but it still had an odor even then.  I can still smell a faint odor when I walk into the room, although it is fading.  More negatively, I feel like this topper sleeps hot.  We bought this one because it promised to help regulate your sleep temperature and keep you comfortable while you sleep, but I'm still waking up too warm. It feels to me like it holds my body heat instead of distributing it.  I'm going to try changing mattress pads and see if that helps, but I'm disappointed that the sleep cool features don't seem to work as promised.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292SJN64MVOBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HQNX8G#wasThisHelpful","R292SJN64MVOBB","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The good first:  this is a really well-done, fun book.  Pastor's Wives is the story of three women whose lives collide at a booming Atlanta megachurch.  There's Candace, the wife of the charismatic pastor who uses her power to run the church behind the scenes; Ginger, Candace's daughter-in-law who struggles with insecurity and a secret past; and Ruthie, the wife of Greenleaf's newest staff member who as a lapsed Catholic/agnostic finds herself in the awkward position of being married to a man who wants to be ""married to God.""  As their lives intertwine, each of them struggles with her own way with the pressures of life in the church fishbowl.  Each of them also has to answer one question:  what is _my_ purpose here.Again, this is a well-written book.  I think most readers who enjoy character driven drama will enjoy this book.  The characters are complex, the plot moves quickly, and there's a good blend of drama, humor, and surprises in the book.  Just in terms of writing style and quality I think this is probably the best written novel about pastor's wives that I've read.  That said, Christian readers who might be drawn to this book because of the subject matter should know that I would class this as a mainstream rather than inspirational novel.  There's no sex--something I know a lot of inspirational fiction readers are concerned about--but there is some discussion about porn and strippers.  Those topics come up in Christian novels as well, but the style with which they're handled here is a little more frank than readers who only read inspirational novels will be accustomed too.  It's not that it's bad or gratuitous--you'd probably ""see"" more just watching regular T.V., but readers who are really strict about what they read may not like those portions of the book.  Mainly though, I consider it a mainstream book because of how she handles faith issues.As far as the life of a PW, there's a lot in this book that Cullen gets right:  the feelings of isolation, the struggles with church members who don't want anything to change, the frustration at finding that your husband's ministry is more important than you are, the women who like to throw themselves at the pastor.  It's not that any of those things are true of any particular pastor's wife or that all of them have been true of my life, but these things are common.I think the biggest weakness of the book is how Cullen handles faith.  I was curious after I read the book and  looked up her bio and a couple interviews she's done.  What I found was pretty much what I expected.  Though Cullen says she worked through some of her own questions of faith in writing the book, I think the character that she is most like is probably Ruthie, the PW with a Catholic background who isn't entirely sure she still believes in God.  What that means for the book is that her writing of other characters' faith doesn't come off as entirely genuine. There's no sense that any of the characters are really seeking God and relying on God to solve their problems in the way that I and most PW's I know would confronted with the same situations.  Faith in the book is written from the viewpoint of an observer, not someone who understands and has experienced it.Despite that weakness, I found this novel to be an enjoyable read and I'd recommend it to most readers.

"I enjoyed The Selection, but I was disappointed with The Elite.I had hoped in this book that we would find out more about America's world.  Yet because she is confined to the palace, that never really happens.  There are a few more hints about the rebels and their goals, but nothing really substantial. America's main concern continues to be the love triangle and her choice between Maxon and Aspen.  By the end of the book I didn't really care who she chose--I just wanted her to make a decision.  Even though she does make a choice at the end, I'm less than convinced she's going to stick with it in the last book in the series.  The book is okay, but there's just not the depth and world-building I'd hoped for in the follow-up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2T8STJJ4103/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062059963#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2T8STJJ4103","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never knew the candy business could be so cutthroat.When Lucy Kendall comes home after her tour of the continent, she brings with her samples of Europe's best confections and dreams of making the perfect candy--a candy that will save her father's business and even top the secret recipe stolen by her father's chief competitor.  At home, however, Lucy finds that things are changed.  Her father is sick, her mother wants to sell the company, and the new advertising man for her father's rival is possibly the most attractive and most irritating man Lucy has ever met.  She is determined to save her father's company, but Charlie Clark is giving her strong competition--and someone keeps revealing her company secrets.  It's a take-no-prisoners battle, and only one candy will come out on top.I had mixed feelings about this book.  I liked the setting and the background of a 1910 candy company.  I enjoyed the descriptions of Lucy's fashions, the mention of the first presidential flight, and the humor that really did make me laugh out loud a few times.  I also really enjoyed the character of Charlie Clark.  I didn't enjoy Lucy's character as much, though.  She says at the start of the book that she doesn't want to be childish, but I felt that she acted childishly through most of the book.  She grows up a little toward the end, but it seems like for most of the book she rushes from one scheme to another, not stopping to think about who her actions are hurting.  It's okay, but not the best I've read by this author.  I think it may be a little lighter than most of Siri Mitchell's other books--most of her novels have more depth.Overall, this is just okay. Readers who enjoy period romance may like this for the fresh background, but it's not one that's going on my keeper shelf.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a quality review.

"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, but I was pleasantly surprised.  A Healing Heart is an enjoyable read with a nice touch of romance.  I really liked Mara's character, and I enjoyed  the different ways in which the author works in the theme of emotional and spiritual healing over the course of the story.  The issue of women's heart health is nicely portrayed, and I thought the family dynamics were written well.  I also enjoyed Joel's character.  It's so common in mainstream books and movies to find the ""bad buy who is really a good guy underneath"" or the ""overgrown teenager who finally grows up by loving the heroine.""  It's refreshing to find a male lead who is simply an honest, decent man.  I'm still not sure exactly what a business consultant does, but his job  gave him an interesting dynamic with Mara.  I was glad that this was a book where the relationship had time to develop.  That's increasingly one of the things I appreciate in a novel.  It's a relaxing read and might make a good book club selection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6OGCMG30RZI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426752695#wasThisHelpful","R6OGCMG30RZI1","A3O2HIL5V8KY75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2HIL5V8KY75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We first met Robin Price in Wildflowers from Winter as a grieving widow trying to come to turns with her husband's death.  Four years later Wishing on Willows finds Robin building a new life for herself.  She has her family, the cafe she and her husband always dreamed of, and the son her husband never got to meet.  Though her heart still aches, Robin's days are full.  Meanwhile, developer Ian McKay is coming to Peaks on a mission to prove himself and save his father's company while helping revitalize Peaks by building condominiums downtown.  The prime location happens to be the site of Robin's cafe.  While the other owners are willing to sell, Robin can't bear to let go of the place that has brought her hope and healing. Yet, she also finds herself drawn to Ian.  Can she move toward the future without letting go of the past?I think the greatest strength of Katie Ganshert's writing is the way she writes her characters.  Robin seems so completely real and honest.  I think I'd recognize the woman if I met her on the street.  The characters are what really drive this novel.  The plot is somewhat familiar:  big town developer clashes with small-town values, but it's kept fresh because Ian is such sympathetic character who really does want what's in everyone's best interests.  The romance is okay--it's one of those plots where the romantic tension comes from the main characters fighting their attraction for each other throughout the book.  I've just gotten to where I prefer having the hero and heroine actually act as if they like each other a little while they're falling in love, but having them at cross purposes through most of the novel works okay here.  This is a good book and I'd recommend it to readers who enjoy character-driven women's fiction.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a quality review.

"I think these will be useful for us but are smaller than I had expected.  I should have read the product description more closely so that's on me--they're just smaller than I was picturing.The cards themselves are about 3 1/2 by 2 3/4 inches.  The letters are 1 1/4 by 2 inches and fairly narrow--the sandpaper is only about 1/4 inch wide.  They are made out of cardstock, but it's a heavy duty cardstock and feels fairly sturdy.  They're heavier than what you'd get on a playing card or a flashcard.  The quality is reasonable for the price.At any rate, I think they are a good tactile tool for learning letters and phonics.  My son likes tracing the letters with his finger.  Today we played memory with the capital and lowercase letters.  I was also able to get a good crayon rubbing with them. Although they are smaller than I had thought they would be I think they will prove to be worth the purchase.

"This is the second Penny book I've read this month and it is even better than The Long Way Home, which was great. I devoured this, completing it in a day and a half (Yes, it was that suspenseful for me).Louise Penny may be one of the best writers of the psychological ""mystery"" suspense novel out there with her Inspector Gamache series. Of course, as anyone who has read these books know, it's really a deep portrait of the main character and his co-workers and the beloved and quirky folks who live in the ""wish-it-were real"" Three Pines.It never ceases to amaze me how on one hand Penny has created a bucolic and isolated setting so apart in many ways (cell phones don't work; there is no Internet available) a true break from the frenzy of contemporary city, that on the one hand houses a seemingly safe and benign community...and then, wham, introduces a plot line that makes us realize that what you see is definitely NOT what you get when it comes to plots as well as characters.Gamache is officially retired from the Surete but that doesn't mean he isn't involved in the latest (and among the darkest ever) plots that Penny has conjured up. I won't give it away but let's just say she manages to put a spin on what is one of the hottest topics in contemporary life when it comes to our safety and security.As always, the backstory behind the main plot is intriguing and gives us even more glimpses into the lives and history of the town's beloved folk. Where The Long Way Home focused on Peter and Clara, this time around almost everyone gets a lot more detail on their past lives and how it shaped them then, and now.I couldn't not rush through the book because I really wanted to know the outcome but I did savor those bits/snippets about the characters personalities that Penny slips in. I don't know about others, but the residents of Three Pines are real to me (Eileen Atkins as Ruth in a TV movie? Who could play gamache?) and I genuinely care about them, which makes these books all the more engaging.I can't wait for the next Penny Gamache book although given the publication of these two within weeks of each other in summer 2015, I know we'll be waiting awhile.Another winner in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7YO4IQ111OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022088#wasThisHelpful","RE7YO4IQ111OS","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another wonderful entry in the Inspector Montalbano series. If you're a fan, you'll enjoy this one especially as we see a personal side of Montalbano that we may not have expected.This series is formulaic but in a good way. You know what you're getting in terms of the characters and the location. Mysteries are not super suspenseful but the human dimension to whatever Montalbano and crew are working on is always engaging.These books to me are akin to the Donna Leon Inspector Brunetti mysteries, only these would be Brunetti-Lite as it were.A quick and satisfying read, and always nice to see what's going on with one of my favorite Italian detectives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IYWAZERSB13N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02CPA#wasThisHelpful","R2IYWAZERSB13N","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone with ongoing issues with my wrist, I've used Ace and other bandages for over a decade. One of the things I disliked the most was the fabric and color that pretty much scream: Something's wrong with this body part.This black fabric works well because I wear a lot of black and for the most part, my wrapped wrist (to which I do not want to call attention) seems to blend in with my dark and black clothes (Yes, I am a New Yorker. Black IS our ""color."") This makes a big difference and I really like the black option (Did Ace make black bandages before? I don't know. Never saw them in my local CVS where I purchased in past.)Same quality in terms of flexibility with tension levels when wrapped loosely or tightly. Same ease of washing. Same overall Ace quality.Why, oh, why, thy needed to change the self-wrapping aspect is beyond me. All I know is that I could not master proper attachment of the clip most of the time and when I did, it still jutted above wrappings in a way I did not like at all. With a wrist, you don't want anything either on the ""top"" or ""bottom"" because it interferes with using your wrist or even resting it.I much prefer the old version of self-sticking at ends. Lies flat, smooth and it's easy to finish your wrap quickly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIA6JM2156846/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLI9OD4#wasThisHelpful","RIA6JM2156846","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently spent some time professionally doing research on World War I. As I told the person I was working with, ""I'd love to read something that deals with how the war impacted the daily lives of the men and women of that time, especially the ""real"" (not rich) people who made perhaps even more sacrifices than the rich. This story, though fiction, certainly delved into the realities of war and how it affected those literally in the trenches and those back home praying for their return or dealing with the fact that many would not return.The writing style is fine and I liked the way the stories of the various characters were woven, back and forth, via letter excerpts, first-person commentary and regular narrative. Alas, I just didn't feel much for the characters. Somehow, while nailing details of the war's impact on a personal level--and deeply touching me, through very personal descriptions via the character's own words, I felt the author somehow didn't give us enough to get me to really care about these characters.It delivered in the sense that it did create a very atmospheric setting for an exploration of the human toll of war on individuals and the society as a whole. And if you have no real knowledge of the first World War and its impact--both then, over the years and even now---it's a good introduction to the society of the time and how war was experienced at all levels of society. If you've never cared much about the past, and have been bored by traditional historical nonfiction, this is a good way to whet your appetite for a real understanding of the human dimensions of war, no matter which side you are talking about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5SD2YFUE5N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101946482#wasThisHelpful","RL5SD2YFUE5N1","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the success of her earlier works, it's probably no surprise that Gilbert has now entered the self-help book genre. I can easily see how her editors and publishers might have pushed her along this path and into creating this book.  It's not without merit but it's one of those things where it might never have seen the light had it NOT been written by a best-selling author who does intersperse her thoughts with her real-life experience with the challenges of the creative process and who has the creds to speak with authority.Your response to this book is likely to be based as much on how many books/articles you've read on the topic of creativity rather than on what the author actually puts forth here--or your personal feelings about her life. If you've read a lot already, you'll know that there isn't necessarily anything ""new"" here on the subject but rather, as always, some clever packaging and a unique POV--and, as you'd expect of a good writer, some memorable quotes. What may keep you more interested are the various personal insights Gilbert offers on her own life and its creative path. She is honest about the difficulties and that alone helps ""ground"" her book and give it the credibility it needs to be a true inspiration.Big Magic is one of those titles that turned me off and not on. It's only the subtitle that drew me in: Creative Living Beyond Fear. Yes, that's the thing about creativity. It requires risks and comfort with the unknown. Fear is the killer and the dragon we must face to shape our best lives.If you come away with nothing more than a bit less fear about living your daily life as you would like, then the book is worth your time. Sometimes it's not about one's career or writing a book or screenplay or achieving world fame or success. Sometimes it's just about getting all the joy and juice out of an average day and life. All inspiration is personal and subjective. If Gilbert's work has ""spoken"" to you, you're likely to both enjoy and benefit from her insights from her journey. Clearly she has been living a creative life on many levels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VXM3EJDS78Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634718#wasThisHelpful","R34VXM3EJDS78Z","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this is not a self-help book about stress and stress relief. You are not going to pick this up, peruse it and come up with quick fixes, simplistic solutions or how-tos. That said, if you are someone who has serious problems with stress (or who is dealing with someone you care about who does), and you really want to get down and deep with it on more than a superficial level, this is a book that's worth your time.It doesn't read like a textbook, but it is written with a more  cientific and analytical approach to the various components and causes of stress and their impact on the body and our daily lives. Given all the very simplistic articles in the media over the years, you may think you know about stress. Read this and you'll really understand how much more there is to understand about how deeply it changes us on so many levels (emotional, physical) and how we can be less vulnerable to it and become more resilient (per the book subtitle).It's not an easy read, but then it's more akin to an academic textbook than a nonfiction book with stress as its topic. (Given the subject matter, it wouldn't and the density of text, it would not have hurt the publisher to have used a bit larger type. )If you are interested in the physiological, psychological and social aspects/elements of stress, this is a very interesting book. In one volume, it touches on so many key areas that are not addressed elsewhere or given short-shrift or what I call the ""self-help babble approach.""Check out the table of contents in the Look Inside feature of this book. You'll be amazed at the depth of topics. The section on cancer and on caregiving were especially helpful to me, along with the individual sections on hormones, specific diseases and the immune system.  I've read a lot on stress and don't believe I've ever seen so much covered and with such a unique POV and presentation, that what is offered here. It's a true primer for digging into the topic via various entry points.Sometimes, truly understanding how and what we are responding to and our behavior and choices, which can trigger or create our personal stressors, from a physical perspective, can help us get a better grip on the stressors. The author also includes sections on cognitive therapy and drugs for treatment. I don't have experience with either so I can't comment on the validity or relevance of these chapters.Read this and you'll truly understand the full impact of stress on our lives and our lifestyles. Once you grasp how the body responds and how stress is created, then, and possibly only then, can you create realistic (and not quick-fix) solutions. At the very least, you may be more aware and mindful of your triggers and thus prevent them from reoccuring or find better ways to deal with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQXLADNHC10Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118850246#wasThisHelpful","R1OQXLADNHC10Q","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having given five stars in past to almost all the previous books in the series, I could not imagine one that would rate this low with two stars.I have devoured the previous Kinsey Milhone books and when they concluded, felt it was not only a good read but a good use of my time--and I always felt that Grafton had delivered. This time? Not so much.I can't imagine Sue Grafton letting anyone else write in this series (even parts or the entire book) as some reviewers have speculated here, but something is definitely off with this book as compared with those that preceded it. In the past, I've never ever felt bored or found a book lacking tension or its equivalent. I had to force myself to keep reading, believing, wrongly, that the plot really would develop and take on momentum. Maybe this is a style of writing today as I've now read (but did not finish, the first time ever) two other ""mysteries"" where literally NOTHING happened for close to 300 pages of a 450-page book. Seriously.I finished this book and as it came towards the ""end"" I thought I might have a book with missing pages. I'm not kidding. I could not believe we were at the end and with such an ending.This time around, a whole mess of, to me, trivial subplots (the California drought, the issue with Henry's neighbors, which I won't reveal in case someone reading this wants to read the book or is not finished, the angry and vindictive ex-wife who put one over on Kinsey) and almost no character development or character interaction beyond really minor stuff left me wondering: What is going on here? Or, more appropriately, what is NOT going on.Disappointed is to put it mildly. But hey, one book out of 24 not up to par...but I'm surprised that Grafton's editors let this one go into print as is. They do a disservice to the author, to whom I will still pledge that I will read the remaining two books in the series.This is a one-note story and it's not a compelling one. (I'm referring to the reference to a character from Kinsey's past, not the seeming main story buried in all the clutter.) And the ending...more than a little hard to believe given what we're told about one character.If this had ended as a cliff-hangar, it would have been frustrating but actually more credible. As it is, we're left to wonder: Well, does Sue Grafton have a plan that goes way beyond what is actually on these pages...is this a very very LONG runup to something better and more engaging? One can only hope.One also hopes that the last two Milhone books in the series do not follow the path/style of X.X for leaving one hanging out to dry in deep disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NACIRI52GHCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKJA#wasThisHelpful","R2NACIRI52GHCB","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To those who have expressed disappointment in the author because Ms. Penny has deviated from the usual plots, etc. of the Inspector Gamache series, I say, wait, there are other books coming. And also, so sad that you truly missed out on the amazing story told here, better than even the most intense Gamache ""mysteries."" I truly do not understand the criticism because IF you loved the other books, how could you not love this one, too? Of course, I am biased because I loved this book even as it took me down a road that wasn't what I wanted or expected (and bravo to Ms Penny who could easily have provided a different ending that might have been more palatable for fans of the series but perhaps less realistic.)Penny's books, to me, have always been about characters and character development and the psychology of human relationships. The tales use police procedure, life in a small town and the art world as devices to bring forth the psychological development of the main characters and others who appear in a specific story. This outing really delved into the nature of various aspects of our successes and failures (personal and professional) and how they can alter the course of even the most loving relationships. This book isn't about the art world though it uses it as a hook to make many points. It's about so many aspects of how we let our lives slip away with our egos and expectations and most poignantly, the high cost of jealousy in our private and professional lives.And it's about what friends will do to help you in a time of great need. And what those friends learn along the way. I loved this tale even as  I reeled at the ending.This book was not even remotely what I thought it would be and far, far better than I could have imagined. Let's just say that if you have read the Three Pines (how I wish this were a real place although Penny brings it to life EVERY time) series, and embraced the characters, you will want to read this and you will savor it as what is, if you think carefully about what has been going on, a ""logical/next"" sort of step.To me, this is a great gift from the author. How I would love to sit with her and ask so many questions about what prompted this entry.This book struck many chords in me as my life now revolves around issues of vulnerability and of the need for healing, things that both the two main male characters here (Gamache and his former subordinate) face as they try to move forward after the devastating events of the series unfolded. (No need to go into them here because if you've read, you know what I refer to. If you haven't, I'm not going to reveal here.)I raced thru this book and made several notations along the way, copying bits of text here and there. It was deeply upsetting and at the same time, deeply moving and uplifting (perhaps not inspirational but realistic in way that still allows room for hope despite the despair and damage we may feel at times.)Louise Penny is more than a mystery series writer, but then anyone who truly enjoys the Gamache series realizes that the murders and police stuff (and the various bits and bobs one learns along the way about whatever the individual book theme is about, albeit interestingly told)  is just a way to focus and unravel what is, at the core, a psychological-based series about fictional characters that feel real.Three Pines may be one of the most realistic (and wished to be real-life) settings in any type of fiction.What I love most is the humanity, the compassion, the unbelievable depth of understanding shown towards the characters (by the writer) and by the characters to each other.  There is evil and darkness and pain in Three Pines. But there is love, laughter, community and more. I miss it more and more each time I reach the end of a book. Thank you, Ms. Penny. Merci, Beaucoup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EX1GPC7QCTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022053#wasThisHelpful","R25EX1GPC7QCTL","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-designed and very functional pencil pouch.

"If you are dealing with issues of vulnerability; if you're in a place where the struggle has become overwhelming, and you can't afford or aren't getting (for one reason or another) professional help, this is a book well worth your time. Yes, there are a lot of self-help books out there addressing these issues but few are as truly helpful, relevant and insightful as Rising Strong (great title). Brene Brown is an exceptional author whose education (how many self-help authors have a Phd and are social workers?), life work and experience have enabled her to compile a highly readable, reassuring and genuinely ""will change"" your headset and possibly your life after you've finished it.Unlike a lot of books on self-help, this isn't what I call all Pollyanna/think good thoughts/manifest X, Y,Z. It's about what to do when real life leaves you reeling and wondering ""What next? Is there a next?"" When, for various reasons, you feel incredibly vulnerable and at risk in your life, you need to read this book.Like a lot of books out there today in the self-help field, it has a clever title, chapter headings and POV (point of view). Unlike many others, it has real content and not fluff.As the subtitle says: ""If we are brave enough, often enough, we will fail. This is a book about what it takes to get back up.""Personally, I liked the book's anecdotes and stories. It is how real people learn and relate rather than the often dry and academic (and yes, dare I say it, ""pure science"" approach) material out there on the same topic. This author, in my opinion, knows how to take a lot of information and package it so that the average person looking to improve the quality of their life and willing to make an effort to understand what is going on and to implement change, CAN get accessible information.This book may not resonate for everyone but I suspect that a large number of people who've simply given up after falling and ""failing"" in life might find something in here to help them get up and keep going.  You take your help where you find it. It was the right book for me at the right time in my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3MBZNM1SHAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995821#wasThisHelpful","RI3MBZNM1SHAR","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We have a number of cotton and/or linen dish towels (of different weaves, textures), which we've found very useful in the kitchen to wipe hands, dry dishes, mop up spills.These look as if they should be absorbent but they are not. After wiping down one glass and one dish (neither of which were dripping), these seemed to be very wet and no longer absorbing anything.

"First, it's a gel, and NOT a cream, as described. Nice, silky texture to it but comes out in quite a bit more than is needed for under two eyes, even with the lightest touch/squeeze.It moisturizes OK, nothing spectacular. (Takes awhile after putting it on to ""evaporate/dry"" under eye. Leave extra time if you are applying a concealer (yes, some folks will use this in daytime) to eyes.) As for the other product benefit claims, in time I've been using, can't say that I've seen a difference in my under-eye area. Perhaps my puffiness and darkness under eyes is not as severe/prominent as others for whom it has been useful.I've used a few other Garnier eye and skin care products and been pleased but every product can't be a hit. I think a great deal depends on how serious your own problem is with puffiness and dark circles. And your perceived benefit (It is all in the eyes of the beholder after all.)The problem is that a company raises expectations with a product name such as ""Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream Anti-Age plus Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream"" / I'm always leery when the word ""Miracle"" is used to describe a product (and frankly, I don't even understand how a company is allowed to use that kind of wording in a product name or claim.).I don't know if any product can deliver the benefits that this product claims.

"I had seen the ads for this product and was interested to try it. I'm a fan of matte foundations in general and anything that can make your pores ""look smaller"" is of interest.I found the liquid to be a bit thickish, more than I expected from a contemporary foundation (the others with mattifying properties I've tried from other brands in a similar price range were thinner). First time out, I used my fingertips to apply and smoothed out with a face sponge. I'm careful about using a tiny bit but it still seemed very heavy on my face. Worse, it created dry patches (even after applying on skin that had been freshly moisturized).Coverage was good but looked a bit fake and ""thick"" (for lack of better description). Color was OK (Sample sent to me was Classic Ivory).Applied using face sponge in subsequent applications, which helped a bit in terms of ""lightening"" up the look on my face. however, it's a waste of liquid when using this way as sponge absorbs the liquid.It seemed to stay matte/non-shiny for a bit but eventually, the shiny parts of face (nose, chin, forehead) were shining thru. I don't think there is any foundation out there that can keep a face shine free in all cases (high humidity, rain, etc.) so I can't say this is a true negative unless the only reason you are buying this is to maintain a shine-free face.Overall, it's OK but not great. I just didn't like the feel of it on my skin and the way my skin looked, no matter how carefully (and thinly I applied it.

"As someone who has read quite a few female-lead-character driven detective and mystery novels over the years, I'm always looking for a new heroine/interesting female detective. As hard as I tried, I simply could not get into this story or the main character. Whether it's the writing style or the topic or the backstory of the lead character and her family interaction...to me, something was simply lacking. Simply was not intrigued by Fina. The story itself also didn't hold my attention but mainly because I just didn't care about Fina and the writing often just irritated me.Give me Kinsey Milhone, VI Warshawski, or the wild and crazy Izzy Spellman and her family of PIs (Lisa Lutz' Spellman series). Even the formulaic-at-this point Stephanie Plum series.Given the number of others who clearly enjoyed the book, this is just a reminder that our appreciation of any genre, whether crime or mystery, is highly subjective and personal.

"We've had many oven mitts over the years of various sizes and materials but this has to be one of the best. I love the stripping that really does improve the grip. I love that it's made of cotton and is washable. I love the length (no more worrying about burning one's exposed upper wrist!).The design is straightforward yet stylish. It truly does resist both staining and having water leak through, big plusses.Of course, the main function is to protect one's hand while placing items in/out of ovens, toaster ovens and it does this very well indeed. Protection to 500 degrees is another plus. Many seem to be ineffective at even lower temps.Nothing to NOT love about this but one small issue for those of us with small to medium-size hands: It's a bit oversized (good for guy cooks) and can slip off if you're not careful.

"Being able to print on Clear, plastic labels that can then be very easily (and all at the same time) attached to the tabs on these divider pockets is a great idea. But the actual execution, depending on your printer and the template you choose, can be more time-consuming--and annoying-- than simply printing out labels on either plain paper or other types of tabs and then adhering them to the tabs.There's a learning curve here even if you are used to using templates and there is no alignment sheet supplied (a big oversight to my mind and why this is three not four stars). If you've got a lot of these to do, or you need something very professional looking, it's maybe worth your time. If you are just doing a set, well, it depends on how you've previously done labels. For me, this was initially too much work and too much fussing with the printer and template.Clear vinyl/plastic page holders that are sturdy enough to hold 50 or more pages of papers are a great way to segment items in binders--and esthetically these look a lot better than the traditional type of paper/clear tab options one generally finds and uses.Just be prepared with patience and time to get things properly aligned.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3LE1H8P9QBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48PYAK#wasThisHelpful","R2R3LE1H8P9QBB","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To put it in context, I rarely if ever read books by or about celebrities. Diane Keaton is an exception. Thinking she might have a new or thoughtful take on the subjects (aging, beauty), I picked up this book (which is a quick, easy read if you're not looking for more than something to do on a day when you have nothing else to do).I hate saying it's disappointing, but it is. That is, to be fair, a comment perhaps more about me as a reader and the expectations I bring, than it is on the writer. Perhaps I just never found anything too new or profound in Keaton's observations, comments and thoughts about the two key topics.If my best friend had written this, I'm not sure I'd have found it any more interesting.Maybe the real issue is that I wonder why any of us would spend so much time dwelling on certain things.All I know is that I felt a bit sad and depressed reading this. I thought Keaton was perhaps more confident about herself than is the case given what she wrote here.If you come with no expectations, have a few free hours and like Diane Keaton, it may be worth your time.

"After a recent inpatient surgery, I suffered excruciating pain and severe nausea and vomiting (to the point that I had to be hospitalized).Since I had the same surgery (albeit under general anesthesia) twice, two weeks before and did not have any of these problems, once I recovered I suspected that something had changed in terms of anesthesia during the procedure and post-op drugs. Everyone at the hospital kept saying: ""No, no. It's not the anesthesia."" But I am super drug sensitive, something doctors neither seem to understand nor take seriously, and I knew that the only variable in all of this was the drugs (type, quantity and when administered).After verifying what I was given in the third surgery, it was clear that it WAS the anesthesia. At that point, I wanted to  educate myself on other aspects of anesthesia. This book, which is written in a way that seems to be more consumer friendly and educational than a truly medical book, really helped.In my opinion, if you want to make a truly informed decision about surgery (or other procedures) that require anesthesia, it's worth your time for you or your patient advocate (not the hospital one but the friend or family member who serves as yours) to review the contents of this book.You may learn more than you want to know, but...better to know than become a statistic. That's my thinking.At the very least, you will be able to ask more pointed and relevant questions (although again, you tell doctors things and they still seem to either forget or ignore what you said...a real concern. Maybe you need to text them everything to get their attention.)in advance of any procedure (where you have that option).It can also help you better understand the process and, hopefully, reassure you on some levels. (Any professional medical doctor will tell you that ALL procedures and any type of anesthesia have risks. No matter how minor or major the  procedure.)I wished I'd had the opportunity of reading this before my procedures.This book isn't for those who belong in the ""I don't want to know about it"" group. It's for those of us who want to educate ourselves, work better with our doctors to ensure accurate and safe procedures and better understand what is involved with the administration of anesthesia, which is a key, if not the key, componenet of a procedure.I think this book belongs on the bookshelf in any home where an adult or child lives. Because you never know when you'll need to know this information right away!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MX4M7J59G0CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405187565#wasThisHelpful","R1MX4M7J59G0CF","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not really ""green"" to use disposables but in real life, there are times when you need the option of a good paper plate. Plus, because these are so sturdy and you can use just one plate to heat (microwave) and serve, you are saving both paper and water for washing regular dishes. In the past, we heated up stuff on the paper plates which were then soggy and falling apart and required another regular (non-disposable) plate for serving or eating. That is wasteful.I love the sturdiness of these especially as we use them to reheat a lot of food that has liquids and/or some greasiness. The liquids don't seep into the plates and you can then serve and/or eat from them as needed. Saves water (for washing by hand; we don't have a dishwasher) and time. Plus, we've cut down on a lot of spills and stains. (You have to be careful taking most regular paper plates out of the microwave as stuff often leaks or seeps over the edges.)The size (8.5 inches) is great; neither too big nor too little. Definitely helps with maintaining healthy portion size. Would prefer all white rather than the colored pattern but since we're not using these for a party or decoration, it really doesn't matter.We use these in the apartment, for picnics and when we travel. At about $.065 per plate, they aren't cheap but you get what you pay for. You could easily, depending on what you place on it, reuse these by wiping them off or shaking off crumbs.Some reviewers noted that the plate surface gets ""sticky"" in the microwave. We have used extensively in microwave and have not had this problem.These have become our new ""go-to"" disposables and it'll be hard to revert to the traditional cheap and flimsy white paper ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMV9GXEAXZFWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DP5VX58#wasThisHelpful","RMV9GXEAXZFWB","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've got about a half-dozen Swingline staplers in our home and home office and I've used even more at work over the years. Most have held up pretty well to heavy-duty usage in terms of amount of paper and frequency of use. Rarely had jamming issues. All sizes took same standard staples.I haven't had this model long enough, or tested it rigorously with batches of multiple page items, to determine it's functionality and stability (as in it won't fall apart) if used very frequently and/or for heavy usage for multiple-page sets. Who knows if this construction and material will stand the test of time but if, for some reason, you need a ""gentler"" stapler, this qualifies.As for being ""50% easier"" to use. How is that measure? By sheer grip/force needed? It is lighter in weight and you just need a gentle touch (if it's placed on a surface) or a squeeze (if used while in hand) but that may have more to do with material (plastic) than some specific construction trick.It's easy to load and uses standard size staples. I've read that others have had issues with jamming, but that hasn't happened so far. You never know with staplers but one has high expectation for the Swingline brand.$13 is a lot for what is something that has a plastic body. Let's hope it's sturdy plastic.After playing with it for a bit, I realized that unlike other staplers, this doesn't ""open up"" so that you can use it on flat surfaces. That's not a negative, IF you don't need it to do that. But that option is one that most of us do use (if only periodically) and are used to from other models. One wonders if the omission of this feature was deliberate or could not be incorporated with this design.If a light touch is your primary need and you're not using this in an office situation that requires a lot of hand stapling (or flat stapling), this could be a good option. However to really appreciate the light touch (whether 10% or 50%, it has to be relative to whatever model you were using!), you'd probably have to be using it enough for your hand to appreciate the difference.FYI: If you plan to mostly use this in your hand, keep your own hand size in mind. Mine is fairly small (size 6 glove) and this is too big and uncomfortable for hand-stapling.

"We basically use these as the household cleaner equivalent of antiseptic handwipes. Wipes are convenient and easy to use so we tend to use them more often to clean up various bits and pieces in the kitchen and bathroom as well as other elements that get a lot of individual hand prints each day (door knobs, metal or plastic handles on dressers,etc. the surfaces of various pieces of furniture not wood).They are a lot more convenient (albeit not less expensive) than toting around a spray bottle of cleaner and a roll of paper towels or microfiber cloths.We haven't done any scientific swabbing and testing to find out if these wipes actually disinfect surfaces, so who can say if/how effective they are. But Clorox is a trusted brand, so one starts by assuming they do work.The two downsides, and why they get three stars, are the scent (The citrus is tolerable; the fresh scent, not so much) and the way they get stuck in the top opening when you try to start them and during ongoing use. Very annoying to have to stick one's fingers in the tight plastic opening to pry stuff out and pull it through. That needs work. I've almost cut myself a few times.I don't know why companies think everything needs to be scented. I'm highly sensitive and loathe all this scented stuff. Are they trying to mask what they feel is an unpleasant smell?The size is good and we can use one or two to clean off the work surface of counters in our kitchen and/or to wipe down the sink in the bathroom. Convenience is key as I like being able to wipe down with one item versus paper towels and a spray bottle.I wish the package were a bit smaller as I'd like to be able to take these with me for train, air travel (although I think I saw them in small packets in a store recently.)They seemed to stay wet and not dry out in the package, which is good because we've tried other brands that seemed to dry out pretty quickly even in tightly closed packages.Our trio arrived intact, with no leakage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEJJSNHY64TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSC9F2C#wasThisHelpful","RHEJJSNHY64TO","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I chose this book because, with little real depth of knowledge about gluten-free cooking, I wanted a reliable source of information. As a fan of America's Test Kitchen, I thought this would be a good jumping-off point to educate myself on the basics of gluten-free cooking.This book met those objectives. The up-front sections (background and how to select) info on grains, breads, gluten-free flours and pastas were an especially helpful summary/overview.I was, like others, somewhat surprised (shocked even) to see their reliance on white flour in recipes, something I want to avoid. The recipes also use a lot of milk and eggs. That said, you can still get a quick intro to the basics of gluten-free cooking and baking. Just don't treat this as the bible or the most comprehensive tome on the subject matter.Depending on your other health/dietary concerns, you'll find recipes that work within your dietary constraints. If you're into baking, there are a lot of recipes for bread, rolls as well as deserts, including cookies and cakes and pies. I don't bake a lot so I would have preferred more recipes for dinner appetizers and entrees.What I liked:>The book's format and layout; very clean and uncluttered. It's visually easy to read and see the important bits in each recipe and it's well-organized for easy quick reference to various topics. (If you're a novice cook, there are bits and bobs of ""how-tos"" on various relevant aspects for almost every recipe included in the book.  And I'm fond of the ""Why it works"" section, which helps educate you on the fine points of a recipe. (may be of no interest to some folks, however)>>The page on ""Weight-to-Volume Equivalencies for GF Flours"" which you'll find invaluable if you're trying to rework other recipes using various commercial flour brands.>The section on ingredient substitutions.There weren't a lot of recipes of interest to me given my interests. Again, I'm not a big bread, pasta or desert person.But I must say, some of the recipes did make me want to try them out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXHF7Z3EZ3ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493616#wasThisHelpful","R3NXHF7Z3EZ3ZR","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this newest entry in the series because I like the main character, Ten,  (a Buddhist and  former LA cop and current PI) and I  enjoy how the authors weave in various Buddhist principals and teachings. I've always wondered how someone like Ten, who was raised/lived in a Buddhist monastery, would deal with the pressures and stresses of real life...and ""real"" life in LA!It's interesting to get inside Ten's head as he deals with various situations that challenge his beliefs and his practice. I like that he's written as a human (read: Flawed) hero and not as some unrealistic, idealized specimen. Ten doesn't always make the best choices for himself and he ends up hurting himself and others. It's his awareness and openness to change that makes the journey interesting---if you happen to be interested in and/or practice Buddhism.Let's be clear. This isn't a series with the depth of characters and plots as say Louise Perry or Donna Leon, but it's a light, quick read. The plot lines are thin, not all that intriguing or well-developed. This is a character-driven series and if you like Ten, you'll enjoy the latest entry. Reading is like catching up with a friend you haven't seen in a bit. You want to know how his/her life is going and what they've learned and been through.I'd strongly suggest that you read the first two books (in order) in the series before picking up this one.An excerpt from the fourth installment is included. I'm definitely intrigued especially as it raises some real questions about Ten's former partner.I'd like to see the writers go deeper with the plot lines to further explore Ten's integration into the modern world. And I hope we can steer clear of the over-emphasis on Ten's dating/relationship stuff, which I found so boring and uninteresting in this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6PYZC4FNLBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401941672#wasThisHelpful","R1U6PYZC4FNLBA","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We took the time to open every package and take out each bulb and test to be sure it worked. Thankfully, they all did.This makes it a good deal price-wise, which it would not be if some bulbs did not work or had been broken. It helped, I think, that the box of bulbs (four to a pack) was such that the twelve packs were tightly packed with no room for movement and then, the box they were in was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in another box. That said, lightbulbs are fragile and we know that all shipping services pretty much treat packages roughly, even when, as this box was, it was labeled: Glass / Handle with care.The real test of course is how long these bulbs last. We've purchased bulbs in the past (all GE, bought at retail and online) that seemed to burn out in days of even mild use.Right now, I'm glad that we have the option of buying bulbs like these that have been discontinued. At the prices currently charged for the alternatives, we simply can't afford the number of bulbs we need for the lamps/lights in our apartment. Too bad the government doesn't take that into account. And the new bulbs? You spend a fortune experimenting until you find one that delivers the quality /color of light you need. Most are just awful.And as for the savings? We've heard from friends who have sprung for expensive bulbs that the new ones simply do not last for years and years (as advertised and promoted). So much for the ""savings.""We'll be buying these until we can't find them anymore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R331F26WWLOTMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB4NODK#wasThisHelpful","R331F26WWLOTMH","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.I've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.Other than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).Texture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on ""evenly.""Look when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)Color: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled ""blonde"" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAFTMOLENR5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z5YBK0#wasThisHelpful","RUAFTMOLENR5R","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a variety of Suave body wash and haircare products for about a decade. This, like the others, has delivered in terms of my expectations for what I want from a shampoo: Moisturizing, non-drying, easy to lather and rinse out, economical and leaves hair easy to comb out wet even if you're not using a wash-out conditioner.Scent is highly personal, so it's not surprising that some reviewers have had a negative response. I'm very very fragrance sensitive and many haircare (and other) products never make it into the shopping cart because they have scents that are either too strong or unpleasant (to my nose). Fortunately, this was not the case here. I found the scent to be fairly mild in the shower and not the kind that lingers when your hair is wet or when it dries. What it does is turn shampooing in the shower into a bit of a spa experience. The scent, the color, the texture (very creamy) of the liquid all work together to make it feel as if I'm getting a shampoo in a salon. These are all plusses especially in a product at this price point.With my colored, dry, frizzy/wavy hair, the real test is how my hair feels wet after shampooing and how easy it is to comb out using my wide-toothed wooden comb. This product rinsed out easily (though it would be easy to put on too much given how creamy it is if you do not carefully monitor your application), left my hair tangle free and easy to comb.When my hair dried (naturally), it was clean, soft and did not have any lingering scent (what I love in a shower I do not necessarily want for my hair). All ""good things"" for any shampoo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7ZFJX9RKHEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSNWZFU#wasThisHelpful","R1F7ZFJX9RKHEP","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd been using another brand's case and was OK with it but felt it was too bulky and ""ridged,"" plus the side buttons required intense pushing to work thru the case.This case is everything I wanted: Sleek, well-fitting, lightweight with easy to push side buttons and easy to access port covers for  headphones/speaker and power cord connections. I'm from the ""less is more"" school of design and this design is clean and functional. The materials and snug fit make it easy to store and easy to hold.Comes in easy to open (and store items) packaging, already a plus since you don't have to cut thru anything (or your fingers) to access the case and the screen protector (which comes with a little cloth to polish the screen).As others have noted, the one flaw is the screen protector. Mine did not seem to have any self-adhesive and did not stick to the surface (and it got smudges on it as I tried to get sticker off) so I just inserted it under the sides of the rubber cover, which pretty  much holds it in place--a workaround that may not be acceptable to you if you want something that actually adheres to the screen. It moves around (pulls down) a bit at times but no big deal.What I don't get is why the screen protector piece is NOT full size of the screen. Screen protector stops a bit before the bottom of the screen. Is this a flaw? Or by design?Installation was simple--once I realized that you have to separate the two pieces (the rubber wraparound and the plastic cut-out back). You place the phone inside the rubber piece, then secure the plastic cut-out back to that.There was a bit of pushing to get the edges of the rubber piece secure around the phone but once in place it was very secure.This is probably one of the best, if not THE best, protective cell phone cover sets I've used over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TPGH5XJWIP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSQ3N0E#wasThisHelpful","R34TPGH5XJWIP6","A221I9R7I92ORO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221I9R7I92ORO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe my expectations were too high but I just could not get into this book.  The brothers' lives/stories just did not move me in the least.I've read other books (fiction, nonfiction) with cooking, restaurant and food prep themes.

"Review upated 9/3/2015 with following comments (original review follows below)I had to come back and update my review here as I experienced problems with the remote that I had ordered and had been using when I wrote the review below.  I give great credit to the vendor as they have worked with me, or are working with me, to resolve the problems that I've had by accepting the now defective unit (the volume up area of the joystick on the remote ceased to function after a few weeks of being on my motorcycle's handlebar) as a return and get me a new one that will resolve this issue.  I appreciate the vendor's efforts and their customer service as they've been nothing but friendly about working with me.  I did get a little frustrated with the manufacturer who I turned to originally, expecting that they'd offer to RMA the device and swap it for me.While the manufacturer eventually headed towards doing an RMA, they also suggested that I would be best to turn back to the seller.  I'd much prefer to not have to go back to the vendor, especially with something that I'd call a manufacturing defect, but I have to admit it is up to the manufacturer to determine how they wish to proceed, and also up to the vendor as to how they want to handle problems.I am again looking forward to getting a replacement unit, but that will take a few weeks to get done.  Meanwhile I'll go back to using the headset directly (the 20S that I was pairing this with).  It may not be as convenient for adjusting the volume while listening to music, or switching the channels while listening to the FM radio, but it does work.Review updated 9/3/2015 - original review follows:I have a couple of observations and recommendations with this device as a few days of usage has lead me to a few issues and some pointers that may help others out.I originally oriented this device similarly to the picture that is shown on the product listing with the joystick on the ""front"" of the device and the power indicator light at the top.  When I did that, I found myself hitting the buttons too easily which lead to frustrations and actions that I didn't need/want at that point occurring (things like changing radio stations when I didn't intend to).I wound up turning the device ""upside down"".  Once I did that I found myself hitting the buttons much less frequently.  On a related note, I also found through trial and error that the buttons weren't doing what the instructions stated they would.  For example, bottom button is supposed to be the equivalent of the Ambient button for Sena 20S users (which I am) except that doesn't seem to be the case, at least not for me.  The bottom button (which is now the top button for me) instead serves to turn the FM radio on (if held in for 2 seconds, give or take) and also serves to advance the FM station to the next preset station when the button is pushed momentarily.I am easily able to use the joystick to flick up or down to lower or raise the volume (reminder, I'm using this device upside down to ""up"" lowers volume, ""down"" raises the volume).I have mild frustrations with how this device fits on my Harley Dyna, since it is a little wide and tends to line up in such a way that it blocks my thumb access to the left turn signal and other buttons on my left control cluster.  I find that I have to move my hand a bit to reach my thumb over past the joystick and this remote control to reach the turn signal, horn button, or headlight control.  Additionally, I would note that using this device also means lining up the open end of the remote control so that your clutch handle can be pulled back into the space where this remote control might otherwise block it at.  Think of this device as a bit horseshoe or U shape that has to have the opening of the horseshoe/U aligned with your clutch handle.  If you don't have that sort of alignment the thickness of this device may intrude into being able to completely use the clutch (which would be a very bad thing).For me this is a fairly solid 4 star device.  I might use more of a 3.5 star rating if that was possible, but it isn't, and I really do find this device very useful, so I'll stick with the 4 stars.  If you are a user of a Sena headset, then definitely consider this add-on if you can use it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QHII9VISN93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100F7R5K#wasThisHelpful","R17QHII9VISN93","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the record, this would be a 4.5 star item for me, but I've rounded up here.  (Which is what I alluded to in the title for this review)Over the last year I've been through a Sena SMH5 (no FM), then later an SMH5-FM and then later a Cardo Scala Rider G9x before circling back around to get this product (20S-01).  I've liked all of the above, though each of the previous devices had something missing here or there that led me to swap one for the next (typically passing the older devices down to another rider who might be able to make some use of the device).I liked the SMH5.  It was fairly simplistic, but worked well enough for me to listen to music on or answer phone calls with while riding.  I would note that I didn't have a lot of success with voice commands for it, but using the Jog dial was easy enough to get the hang of.I upgraded later to the SMH5-FM because I wanted to be able to listen to ""live music"" over the radio, or get sports talk or news talk to catch up on current events.  That device worked well in the end, but I encountered some issues with it that originated from the TomTom Rider 2013 device that I paired it with (when I selected the sound ""none"" for alerts I didn't realize it was going to flip to silence for some period of time.  I assumed that none meant no alert sounds and no interruption of other audio that I might be listening to).  I didn't determine the source of that problem until after I had upgraded again, to the Cardo Scala Rider G9x.  With that device in use I was able to test things out more and link the alerts that the TomTom device was putting out back to the seemingly dropped audio.I liked the G9x but... it suffers from a lack of LOUDNESS in the audio.  It does boost the loudness with AGC (Automatic Gain Control) that is keyed to noise and speed, but when it does boost the audio it winds up garbling it a bit, or making it hard to determine what you are actually hearing.  Think of a speaker that was turned up too loud and just can't handle the volume level you are tasking it with.  Outside of that issue, I also found myself wanting the Sena Jog dial control again, versus the button arrangement that the G9x uses.  Oh, one other fault with that device is the lack of an available remote control (where one is available for this device).Now, this device isn't without issues for me.  The voice commands definitely worked with the G9x.  I was able to make enough noise to wake it up easily (typically by using the word ""Radio"" in a reasonably stern voice) and then could give it a command that it understood and completed.  I've not had similar success with the 20S, but do intend to practice more with it and fine tune it (if possible) to get it to respond better when I want it to.That leads me to another quibble with this device, and that is one that I've seen with all of the Sena products that included FM Radio (the products that I have tried).  The setting for using RDS to help ""lock in"" stations is apparently backwards, at least for my usage.  With that setting on the radio tends to ""drift"" and starts scanning around on the FM dial to find another station rather than actually sticking with the station that I was listening to and locking in that signal.  In fact, if I turn off the RDS functionality and just let the static and fuzz come through occasionally the signal locks much better and never drifts to another station.I would note a similar not quite as expected functionality with the use of the handlebar remote that I paired with this device, but that will show up in a review of that remote control when I get an opportunity to write it.The FM audio and other audio levels definitely reach a higher volume level without getting ruined (when compared to the G9x as an example).  The FM station range is reasonably close to the G9x as well, and as a big advantage, the Sena products don't come with concerns about gray market purchases that the Cardo Products seem to make an issue of for purchasers that didn't purchase directly from an authorized retailer (which the big A to Z retailer here is not).Oh, one other area where I would have to acknowledge that Cardo seems to have an edge compared to Sena is with their supporting smartphone application.  Probably just personal tastes, but I found I liked the Cardo app better compared to Sena's.  I somewhat assume that eventually the Sena app will offer the same things that I like in the Cardo app, and may even be an improvement over the Cardo app.  That's an area where the healthy competition should lead to improvement.So, this isn't quite perfect, but is awfully nice (from my perspective) and is a device that I absolutely love having.  Being able to listen to the radio, or take phone calls is really nice.  Made even better with the handlebar remote control (though that device isn't quite perfect for me).  4.5 stars if possible.  Rounded up to 5 if not. ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139DV57FGD6SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJGPN2K#wasThisHelpful","R139DV57FGD6SV","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a refurbished one of these Acer Aspire Switch 11 computers (the SW5-171-39LB model) back in April, after searching around through potential local retailers to find any that might have one of these in stock to check out in person.  I was able to find the little brother version (the one with the 10"" screen) at a certain brick and mortar store that just happens to have been primarily Windows oriented ;-)  Seeing that one in person left me feeling more comfortable about how big the keyboard was on this model and how much more I'd like it compared to an ASUS T100 10-Inch Laptop [2014] that I had purchased previously.  While that little Netbook/Tablet hybrid computer was OK, I had grown frustrated with the size of the keyboard (the keys are just a little too small on it) and also because of the size/resolution of the screen on that device.  Just a little too small (that 1.6 inches makes all the difference in the world).I loved the battery life on that T100, and really appreciated that it could be charged through a Micro-USB type connection, though I would also have to note that you needed to use the charger it came with or at least a charger that provides plenty of juice otherwise the poor thing would outpace the charger and leave you draining the battery faster than you could charge it.This Acer Aspire Switch 11 has its own charger that you likely won't find a good generic replacement for.  You can find some less expensive chargers for it, or some OEM chargers from the big A to Z online store here, but this is not a device that charges through a Micro-USB connection.Where this device shines is in an awfully pretty screen.  The 11.6"" diagonal offers just enough additional screen real estate to let me see things without seriously straining my eyes because of the small type.  At least after adjusting and selecting the ""larger"" display mode that is offered on this device that is the case.  You can still select a display mode that makes things small (due to the higher resolution that this device offers) if you want, but for an aging set of eyes like mine you likely want bigger on the screen instead of smaller.The tablet portion of this device is definitely top heavy.  The keyboard portion of this 2-in-1 is very light.  It can easily tip backwards when used in laptop mode as the keyboard isn't heavy enough to counter balance the tablet portion.  Going with Tent mode helps in that area, or turning the screen backwards on the keyboard base if you'd prefer, but if you select either of those options you lose the use of the keyboard and are pretty much forced to use the device in tablet mode.The 128GB of ""drive"" space that the version of this device that I had purchased is nice.  While the T100 that I still have only had 64GB (which at the time I purchased it was a lot compared to the 32GB that was standard on most of the lower-end devices) of ""drive"" space, it was enough for most of my needs.  In fact, that device still had plenty of room available when it was time for me to upgrade to Windows 10 (and it did upgrade easily enough).  With the 128GB that this device featured I had absolutely zero concerns about having enough room for the Windows 10 upgrade process.4GB of RAM is definitely very nice with Windows 8 (or 8.1) or Windows 10.  While 2GB works fine (and worked well enough for me on a Dell Venue 8 Pro 5000 Series 32 GB Windows 8.1 Tablet), I go with the thought that with Windows operating systems that more RAM is always better.I really do like this device and use it quite frequently for taking notes (using OneNote), or streaming some music via iHeart Radio or Amazon Prime music streaming.  While I wouldn't turn down something more powerful if given the opportunity, I like this well enough to easily recommend it for most potential purchasers.  4 solid stars, leaning towards the 4.5 mark.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA72IBSHLYZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNQFDIM#wasThisHelpful","R2PA72IBSHLYZX","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I requested this product for review because in just looking at it I could tell it was going to appeal to more than a couple of the youngsters in my extended family.  My nephew's son has been seriously into dinosaurs over the last year.  The unfortunate thing for me in having any thought that he'd really enjoy playing with this toy is that in his case if it doesn't appear to be hyper-realistic he just isn't interested.  For a still relatively young child, he is more than a little picky about his toys.  My wife and I gave him a couple of plastic dinosaurs that we did purchase through the big A (here) and those were some of his favorite toys last year at Christmas time.  While this toy is not as realistic as that one was, it does offer a big advantage - being able to assemble it in a similar fashion as one might do with Lego toys.For other, less selective, younger members of the family the ability to assemble these toys and then play with them after they are assembled would lead to many hours of fun.I would note that these aren't quite perfect.  The instructions are definitely similar to Lego instructions and unfortunately just like Legos the instructions seem to cut corners a little.  Just enough to possibly frustrate some individuals that might be working on assembling these toys.  More than likely the assembly would eventually happen, but not without some confused looks as to how things go together in a few of the potential steps.4 solid stars for this toy.  If you've got youngsters that would like to play with dinosaurs, there is plenty of value here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266T0TBZWFHQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTLHNI8#wasThisHelpful","R266T0TBZWFHQ6","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If possible, this would be closer to 3.5 stars, or maybe a little below that level, but since ratings here can't use anything other than whole numbers I've rounded down.  Hang on for a bit and hopefully you'll find that I've justified that rating.Let me say that I like this device, and it does have a few features that I consider serious positives.  The ability to use your own speaker, or your own microphone if you preferred - either of which will easily plug in with a common plug type.  That is something that just isn't possible on the Sena Bluetooth headsets that this unit replaced for me.On the more immediate negative side though, and the reason that you won't find a ""verified purchased"" badge for this item for me is that the manufacturer has some notoriety for not wanting to provide support for their products if they weren't purchased from authorized retailers (which, unfortunately, the big ""A"" here is not :-( for this item)  While you might luck out and find an authorized dealer that lists the item here, that isn't likely as if they do list the item here they would likely do so at a discount and that is something that the item manufacturer doesn't want to see happen to this device.  Anyway, given the manufacturer's stance towards purchases from gray market retailers, you would potentially place your purchase at risk if you don't stick with buying from an authorized dealer.Realistically, buyers should not expect to have issues with this item, at least not the kinds of problems that would need warranty support.  It is well made, and well documented, and easy enough to ""assemble"" (install on your helmet).  The instructions are clear as well.  Those areas are also positives for this item.Back to the negatives though are a few more serious annoyances.  Volume levels top out at lower levels than I would like and lower than I suspect most buyers would be happy with.  While the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) works and boosts the volume as you get more noise and potential interference, it does so in a way that leaves the sound less clear.  My own feeling is that the device's sound quality lacks bass and tends to be more on the high (treble) side, so it tends to become a bit of a high pitch whine sound when the volume is boosted through the AGC.  If I could adjust the tone, I would certainly aim for more bass.  I'd also like to see this device ""go to 11"" to get at least one more, or perhaps two more notches of potential volume settings.  I don't wish to blow out my ear drums, but I find myself thinking this headset just isn't bringing the volume levels that it should.The FM radio functionality is nice.  The reception though, is a little disappointing, at least given the raving that other users did which helped lead me to purchase this headset.  I had an expectation that I'd be getting clearer reception than I had been getting from the Sena SMH5-FM headset that this headset replaced for me.  I've since passed that headset on to a co-worker who was thrilled to get it, but I suspect that if I put that headset back into usage I would find that the FM reception was actually better than this unit provides (meaning I could get reception of stations several miles further away with the SMH5-FM than I do with this Scala Rider G9x).  The reception, however, depends quite a bit on the routing of the speaker wires, and I might find myself getting better FM reception with this if I spend more time routing and/or re-routing the cable to the right speaker around in my helmet. Beyond the signal quality though the SMH5-FM had better - at least for my tastes - volume levels, which again leaves me thinking that perhaps I should have stuck with that device and not tried so hard to find nirvana in the motorcycle Bluetooth headset area.The control scheme (buttons) are not bad though it has been taking me a little while to get my fingers used to which buttons are which, especially when I have gloves on.  While these buttons are glove friendly, they're not exactly easy to distinguish even with obvious effort from the manufacturer (or their designers) to provide decent tactile response and controls.  You would likely find yourself feeling around a little to confirm whether you are hitting the A button, or the B button, or the center button, etc.  That problem area introduces another potential area of disappointment for me - the lack of a handlebar mounted remote control option (such as the type that is offered for some of the Sena models).I can use the smartphone app (which is another plus for this device), but that typically means either pulling over on the side of the road so I can tinker with the app, or doing something I'd consider a little stupid - mounting my smartphone on my motorcycle so I can attempt to use it while I'm riding.  Neither is really the right solution, at least not in my opinion.One more area of note for the FM radio options - the G9x offers only 6 presets for the radio station settings.  The SMH5-FM offered 10.  If you are lucky enough to live in an area with plenty of stations to choose from those extra presets can be handy and can again save you from having to pull out the phone and application so you can scan up or down the FM dial a bit.In the end, I like this device, but wish the manufacturer was more consumer friendly in their pricing and support for persons that purchase from, well, anywhere.  I wish it offered a handlebar remote control option, and I really wish it offered more volume and better tone preferences/options for users.  The positives for this device just don't make me want to move my rating higher.  (Though I suppose I could give this device another plus for the case that it comes with, which I would note I'm in agreement with some other comments that I've seen - the case is nice, but it will likely be put away quickly to collect dust once you get things configured and begin using the device regularly.)I may yet come back in the future and be posting a review of a SENA 20S device, though in my research on that device I'm still finding that it uses SENA's own speaker connection which means no chance at using my own preferred speakers with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWMQTIT0TBNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXC6M00#wasThisHelpful","R1WWMQTIT0TBNR","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking to improve the Wi-Fi strength within my home, especially from the Verizon FiOS router that is used primarily within the home.  Sadly that router has never done a great job of providing coverage from end-to-end in my home and because of that I've had to make use of a second router to reliably extend coverage into what would otherwise be under-served areas of the home.  In my efforts to improve the signal strength I've used replacement antennas from Hawking, as well as other manufacturers whose wares were peddled here.  Truthfully none of them seemed to have provided much benefit.  With that all said, I learned long ago that signals can be highly directional and where the antenna is pointed can make a great deal of difference.  That combined with where the antenna is situated vertically within the deployed space, as well as types of materials that exist within walls of the facility can all impact signal strength.Note, I would not expect to see any boost in network speed as a result of using these antennas, at least not in most situations.  The benefit that would be gained would be in signal strength.  If your equipment had been dropping speed in order to continue to maintain signal then you might see benefits in speed, but otherwise expecting a speed increase would be wishful thinking.I appreciate that these antennas were designed for both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  On one of my most recent purchases (an Alfa 9dBi WiFi Booster antenna) I could never find any specifications that discussed which bands that antenna was intended to cover.  With most current routers designed to provide Wi-Fi in either band, getting an improvement in both bands is appreciated.This two pack of antennas is a little spendy compared to other alternatives (the previously mentioned Alfa antennas as an example), but they are well made and simple to install.  4 solid stars.Edited to add: please do experiment with the antenna direction.  If possible, use a Wi-Fi signal strength application on your smart phone or tablet device and measure your performance as you change the antenna direction.  Doing this should help you nail down your best results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPA5O5VXFK4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJJAYLI#wasThisHelpful","R2NPA5O5VXFK4O","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case reminds me a bit of my younger years when my father was into scuba diving and had high hopes of building his own water proof case for a 35 MM camera that he hoped to be able to use while diving.  I don't think my father ever did get his case to work as he had hoped, but I must admit to also sharing thoughts of being able to take pictures under water without having to be concerned that the camera would be ruined from exposure to the elements.  Those thoughts have caused me to put forth some disposable income on a digital camera that had promised to be usable under water.  That particular camera was not that great, as it was fairly low resolution and not as comfortable to use as I might have hoped.This case gives buyers a water proof case that offers a variety of lenses that can be used with your iPhone 6.  The lenses would be interchangeable with other Optrix Body Glove cases.  I really do like that feature, as it would allow me to, as an example, get a case for my daughter's hand-me-up iPhone 5S where I could use the same lenses.Negatives revolve primarily around the expense of this package.  It offers plenty of value for the cost, but it isn't an inexpensive item.  Consumers that can find iPhone cases at low cost from a variety of sellers may balk at the pricing level that is in effect for this item, but putting this case into use could save someone the cost of an action camera and also provides enough variety of lenses to achieve very favorable results.Personally, I'd love to see the same basic product available for my S5.  If it was, I'd be ordering as quickly as I could.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYF4M2HP2GUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7S34HY#wasThisHelpful","R1CYF4M2HP2GUZ","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a few friends posted about this item being a lightning special here I wanted to scream a little myself as I was mysteriously pushed into purchasing this little plush character even if I had no real justification for doing so.  Who needs justification? Are you trying to make me ANGRY OVER HERE?!< big wide evil grin >I really do like this little guy as I'm a big fan of the guy that provided the voice for this character in the Disney/Pixar movie that it comes from.  Lewis Black is someone that I've enjoyed hearing rants from going back several years now.  To me, he is very much in the same vein as another comic that left this spinning ball far too early, Sam Kinison.  Angry yes, but also really, really, really funny.  (Not necessarily politically correct, but definitely funny.)This plush is relatively tame, not really even rising to a PG type rating for the language that is used in the phrases that it is able to play back for you when you press it's left hand.My one complaint? (and the reason for the less than 5 star rating) IT ISN'T LOUD ENOUGH!!! I wish its screaming was louder, and wish that some of the other phrases weren't as quiet as well.  Other than that, it really is just what I would have expected and makes for a great addition to the toys around my cubicle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R746M6BEE9UWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE8YD98#wasThisHelpful","R746M6BEE9UWL","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really hope I don't have to come back and update this review later, but for now the rating is at least 4 stars from my better half.Truth be told, I saw jewelry and thought back to the earlier subliminal programming that my wife has done (""I always love jewelry"" ""You can never go wrong with nice earrings"" ""Shiny is always nice"" and other similar thoughts running through my head) and pretty much hit the button to request these right away.  That all said, I still have a few concerns.  10k Yellow Gold?  Hmm, isn't that a relatively low number?  Don't most people look for that number to be higher.  Shhh!!! Don't tell her, she may not notice.  Ah, heck, you know you can't do that.  Just tell her.  She'll still like 'em if they are shiny and pretty.  (And as it turns out, they are pretty much as shiny and pretty as you see in the image shown.  Not bad for such a low number.)No information available to refer to and research is another concern.  I would think that eventually Amazon will have more details about this item and maybe we'll all learn more about the specifications and quality, etc.  For now, the lack of such additional information is a little worrisome.  I did mention to my spouse that if she sees any strange side effects (shhh! don't jinx the potential use and re-use of these earrings!!!) from these to please let me know ASAP.  I don't expect any issues, but for some reason I have memories of some jewelry I remember my mom or grandmothers having that turned green with use.  Poor quality metals that never should have been used for jewelry got into the supply chain just a little too easily in decades past.""Imported."" noted on the product page.  Hmm, imported from where is also something that leaves me wondering.  For some reason my OCDness kicks in and leaves me wondering pretty strongly if these are imported from some country where the work was done by workers that haven't gotten enough breaks, haven't been paid enough for their time, or aren't as concerned with the potential health and safety of the end user (probably because they themselves weren't paid enough, were overworked, etc.)  I hope that none of these were ever a factor here, and in the end just want to be able to leave a nice 4 star rating that shows how well liked these were by my spouse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LUJF3CF8H01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV6OBVW#wasThisHelpful","R20LUJF3CF8H01","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should note here, up front, that the 5 star rating for these isn't just my own, but rather it should be duplicated a few times as this item would earn 5 stars from me, my stepson, and his oldest son.  Each of us would be happy to give this toy set 5 solid stars as we all LOVE it.  Asking what we like about it (everything) is nearly impossible for us to remember individually, there are just too many aspects that make us love this set.  The range of the shots when fired, the fact that there are two guns to play with, the target to set up and aim at and the fun, fun, fun that can be had once you get things built.  And oh, yeah, the building of the items in the set.  I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of little things that also factor into the rating, but the important part hopefully shines through:  buy this toy set without regret.

"Updated comments (after dropping a few stars from this item as it wore with usage):Originally I had given this item 5 stars as I liked how it worked, but over time and with usage I found that this holster just doesn't hold up.  The front face got scuffed up sooner than I would have expected and the thickness of the leather (or pleather, whatever it is) wasn't enough to keep this holster from wearing through.  I'm certain it was from rubbing up against the seat belt clip in my vehicle, but either way the durability comes into question and results in me having to come back and drop the rating as I don't want to have someone seeing the 5 star rating I had originally given this item only to find out for themselves that the item isn't as durable as it should be.Functionality wise, it continued to do what I needed and wanted until I decided to retire it because of the worn spots on the front.  It easily held my Galaxy S5 and yet allowed for easy access sliding the phone in and out of the holster.  In that area, the 5 stars that I rated it originally would still apply.New rating (due to apparent lack of durability): 3 stars.Original review follows:I really wish this holster had been available when I first got my S5, or heck, even further back to when I had my Galaxy S3.  I had previously used a small hanging 'bag' as a holster for an older phone (back to my days of having and using an iPhone 3GS) and just liked having the phone available at my side by not obnoxiously so.I was ""OK"" with the holster that came with the Otterbox Defender case my phone is in, but inevitably the holster gets snagged on something -- typically the seatbelt/door area on the passenger side of a co-worker's vehicle -- and the OEM holster winds up destroyed (for all intents and purposes) and no longer usable for holding the phone at my waist where I want it.This belt holster works very well for my needs and seems to be plenty durable.  It holds the phone in either a portrait style stance or in a landscape stance if desired and it does it while the phone is still safely ensconced in the Otter Defender case so if the phone were to happen to slip out, it would still be protected.  Really though, there is no need to worry about the phone coming out of the holster as the holster closes nicely and holds well enough with the magnetic 'catch' that keeps the top of the holster held down.Easily a 5 star rating for me, and easily recommended for purchase for anyone that might want a nice holster to hold their Galaxy S5 phone in.  Note though that if you don't have a protective case on the phone about the size of the Otterbox Defender case then you will likely find an issue that I know someone was complaining about for one of these holsters for a Samsung Note 4 - the phone would be swimming around and bouncing around within the holster since these oversized (and clearly noted in the product listings and descriptions) holsters are intended to have the phone kept in a protective case within the holster.The manufacturer here does offer a variety of holsters though, and if you want to use the case for a phone that isn't enclosed in a protective case you can likely find a holster that will work well for your needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPT8BP8I888X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRD12FI#wasThisHelpful","RCPT8BP8I888X","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My relatively poor rating comes from several areas for improvement with this device - hopefully I don't forget them all, but here goes:* Put the display where it can easily be seen.* Put the exhaust area away from the console's air intake area* Personal preference: I'd prefer to have the thing leave the top of my console flat.  Just my own preference but I don't particularly care for the aesthetics of this relatively large add-on that covers only one side of the console.* With this device on top of the console stacking another device on the top of the console (I know, not really advised, but bear with me), even with some sort of spacers in between, would be difficult.If you are concerned that you need to help cool your console, this device would do the job but it may not make that much difference in the long term (unless you are somewhat abusing your console by using it in an small enclosed space with limited air flow).Thankfully Microsoft seems to have learned their lessons with heat exhaust and console devices compliments of the problems that had plaqued the first few years of the Xbox 360's lifetime.  I hope that the Xbox One continues to behave itself in this area and that I will continue to not really *need* this device.3 stars.

"If not for the smell, this might actually rise to the 5 star rating.  Seriously, the smell that this case has is one that will more than tickle your nose during the first several days of ownership.  That was a known for me at the point of ordering, but it remains something that I can't ignore in terms of making recommendations for others that might be interested in cases from this manufacturer.  I've purchased Fintie cases for other devices and have found them to be more than reasonably protective of the devices and easily functional for their designed purpose.  They cover the devices well and make the devices easier to stand and use without having to hold them.  But... during the first few days of ownership expect to notice the odor of the 'pleather' that is used for making these things.Looks (aesthetics) wise these cases look nice.  The one that I purchased was the ""brown leather"" (excuse me, it's actually Vintage Antique Bronze) hard cover book type that for some odd reason, at the time that I purchased and am writing this review, shows with a totally different pattern down in the row of sample color/pattern choices.  (Actually the pattern is a little confusing.  It is trying to show the pattern of the imprinted decoration on the case with a small corner in the upper left showing the Bronze color.  The pattern is drawn on paper or something similar and almost looks like an artist's doodle.)This case does make me smile a bit in that once it is installed the ""spine"" of the case appear to be about 3 or 4 times thicker than the incredibly thin iPad Air 2 that is installed in it.  While thin might be in when it comes to iPads, with this case thin isn't an option.  I don't have a problem with that, but if you really want the iPad to be thin while in the case, then you'll want to look for other options.Personally I like the protectiveness that this case offers and like that it has the 360 Degree Rotation feature.  It is nice to be able to rotate the case and iPad without having to take the iPad out of the case, using it in either a Portrait or Landscape style all while having it stand up nicely by using the grooves in the cover.  Also nice is the automatic wake feature that this case supports.  Open the cover and the iPad Air 2 wakes up automatically.  Other cases may include that feature as well, but not necessarily in combination with the 360 Degree Rotation.All told this is a nice case.  Not quite perfect, but pretty nice.  For me the room for improvement would be having the thing aired out thoroughly prior to packaging and shipping as well as making the cover a little thinner if possible.  I understand making the cover thinner might not work as well as I would hope as it might make the grooves that are in the cover too thin to be able to keep the iPad from slipping while it is standing.  That doesn't make me wish any less though ;-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IX72EU7U2DKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4N0WH8#wasThisHelpful","R1IX72EU7U2DKV","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this game, but... Yeah, I know there's always gotta be a but there somewhere, or at least it seems that way.  There doesn't always have to be a but involved as there are times along the way when something is just so darned perfect that I can't or don't find any faults with it, but this isn't quite one of those times.I really like this game a lot.  It looks good.  Not perfect, but really good.  There is room for improvement graphically but it looks impressive and does a good job of showing off the kind of graphical output that the current generation of console gaming hardware (Playstation 4) can produce.  That said, I see the player images and think that while they are fairly recognizable they just aren't as realistic as I would hope to see.  A little rough around the edges is about the best way I can describe it.On the plus side, the gameplay options are thorough enough to give an older gamer geezer like me an enjoyable experience.  Realistically I just never got that good at playing the supposedly more realistic hit stick and pitching with the stick style games.  I can place the pitch and time the pitch (not that well, but enough to get by) in the beginners/basic interface and still get an enjoyable experience.  It'll take more practice to get the timing down again so I can control the pitches better and if I can find enough gaming time I will do just that.Given the chance, I would have given this a little less than the 5 stars it is getting from me here.  If I had any real alternatives, I might be looking at something more down in the 4 star range, but the alternatives are few and far between.  MLB's own RBI baseball just doesn't cut it for me as it looks too 'toony' and just not that impressive to me.  Wishing for alternatives doesn't make them happen though, and meanwhile looked at in its own right this game is pretty good.If pressed to justify the extra cost for the Anniversary Edition versus the regular edition I'd say spend the extra $$.  The additional cost is minimal compared to what is included for the gamer.  While you can earn extras through your own play, getting the Anniversary Edition gives you a head start and saves you time along the way.  It also offers up the bonus themes you can use immediately to give you PS4 some team flare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23M8PSQE5ASH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVYCCT4#wasThisHelpful","R23M8PSQE5ASH5","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is yet another of those times when I get to welcome in a guest reviewer to help me with the review of this product.  My daughter (well, actually this isn't technically true, as it isn't just my daughter, rather all of the others in the household as I sit alone on Android island) is the iPhone user, at least when it comes to iPhone 6 (the others are still using iPhone 5 devices).  That being the case, and me still thoroughly enjoying the use of my Samsung Galaxy S5, left me looking towards my daughter to be the tester for this case.Given the damage that I've witnessed on the hand-me-down iPhone 3GS that I had passed along to my daughter (or should I say on the old case she had on that device) and the damage that I had seen on the cases she had for her iPhone 4S and the cables and headphones for same, I figure that anything that can survive her usage should be given a few extra stars no matter what I might otherwise think of it.I have to admit that when I saw the image of this case that I didn't think that I'd like the appearance that much.  It seemed a bit too busy for my tastes, and just didn't look that good to me.  My daughter wound up loving it and once I saw it in person and on the phone I didn't think it looked bad at all.  The busy pattern just isn't as busy when you see it in person.On the protective side, my daughter has had the phone cord get snagged with the phone taking a dive off of the table and on to the floor.  With this case on, there have been no negative impact from such occurrences (not that it happens that often, but it does occur often enough to see it happen with this case on the device).In the end, if the design doesn't bother you, then I would think this would settle in around the 4 solid stars that my daughter offered up as her rating.  I'm going along with that rating (hey, I'm not crazy enough to tell any of the women in this household they are wrong on anything ;-) )","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q30WYNCSOCC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH0IXDC#wasThisHelpful","R2Q30WYNCSOCC2","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the 2 star rating might be harsh, it is hard to say that the level of harshness would approach that of the smell of the cleaning solution that the manufacturer supplied with this device.  While I do expect a ""cleaning solution"" like smell, this stuff goes further and is seriously off-putting.  If you are like me and have family members that experience breathing difficulties that are easily irritated and initiated by odors then you likely want to steer well away from this device or at least ignore the manufacturer's recommendation that you use their cleaning solution.  Of course if you do that, well then the manufacturer will caution that you likely won't get the best results -- as if they have some magic ingredient that works that much better than any other cleaning solution that previously existed or may be invented in the future (gee, imagine that, what are we supposed to do if the manufacturer changes their formula in the future??)Besides the smell, there's also the noise that this gadget makes.  On the plus-side, if you happen to be older and getting into the hard-of-hearing territory you might not hear it as well and it may not aggravate you in that area.  For those that do hear well this device seems to do a great job of generating an abundance of noise as it tries to do the job it was designed for.  Admittedly, that problem may be one that varies depending on the luck of the buyer/user but from what I can see in checking around about this device it seems to be a common issue.This device is relatively easy to assemble, is relatively lightweight, and seems like something that could handle a need for many people, but the end result here seems to be clear: this version of this device needs more in-house (back at the manufacturer, not your house) testing and improvement before it is turned loose on the marketplace.  As it stands now, 2.5 stars would be a bit of a stretch, hence the 2 star rating that I've used here.  Thanks for the opportunity to try it as this easily could have been something I purchased and then wanted to return after it was initially used.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322ZO0X7GUK17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWHW#wasThisHelpful","R322ZO0X7GUK17","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worked just as I had hoped.I've previously acquired a  NOCO Battery Life BLSOLAR2 2.5 Watt Solar Battery Charger and Maintainer that I have used with my Suzuki Savage LS650 just to keep the battery charged or charge the battery back up a bit if it is a bit low.  That panel works well for me if I have plenty of time to let the battery charge back up.  Unfortunately my lack of patience got the better of me when I tried to let the battery on my Harley-Davidson Dyna charge back up.  For that bike leaving the Solar panel charger on the bike all day didn't make much headway.  A little I guess, but not enough to get back to being able to turn over the starter when I was trying to do so (so I could take advantage of some milder weather).After checking through several different options for this device, I opted for the 3.5A model.  Once I got it, even though it was still a fairly damp day, knowing that better weather was ahead, I went for it and quickly put this device into service.  I plugged it in and instantly saw the 25% indicator blinking.  Given that the already attached NOCO battery indicator was saying the same thing I knew I'd have to wait for the charge to complete.  Within a short period I checked back and found that the battery level was then showing 50%, and later blinking at the 75% level.  Not long after, woohoo!! 100%.Today I uncovered the Dyna, disconnected the charger and hit the starter.  It roared to life and made me very happy as I was able to take a nice little ride to shake off some of the winter dirt and dust.I'll certainly keep using the Solar charger as it works well when there's time to let it do so, but meanwhile I'm very happy with my purchase of this charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA2JOOGOF84Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWVEKS#wasThisHelpful","R2HA2JOOGOF84Z","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had several versions of this software over the years and generally found it does a reasonable job if expectations are set appropriately. For a do-it-yourselfer that has a fairly straight forward set of requirements this software works well.  On the other hand, if you have a lot of variables and variations away from the types of templates that this software uses and provides then the usefulness goes down and the need may quickly arise to visit an attorney and have them handle your affairs.Note that if you have a previous edition of this software you can likely get by with that version, though upgrading does help to address changes in laws that happen throughout the country.For the price point, this is easy to recommend and solidly falls into the 4 star range for me.  Easily recommended for others, though usability (for completion of creation of wills, etc.) certainly varies depending on individual needs.

"What, you don't think you can believe the subject line I've used for this product review?  Do I need to take pictures of the before and after to show you?  I suppose I could take pictures to show, but if I did that the before pictures might wind up with too much shine (from my balding spots) and could potentially blind people and the after pictures might seriously look like someone glued or stapled a wig or  toupée to the top of my head.  I kid, I kid.I was so eager to get this bottle of shampoo, as I really needed to do something about the thinning hair I have up there.  Sadly, like many men, as I've aged I've gotten hair growing in places that I don't want, and am not growing hair in places where I'd prefer.  While it isn't a George Costanza situation at this time, I definitely see more bare spots up there than I'd like.  Given that situation, and the description of what this product is intended to do, I was hopeful that it would help breathe new life into what hair I've still got on top of my head.On the serious side, I've used Head and Shoulders for quite a while, with 2-in-1 for dry hair.  That product includes conditioner within the shampoo, which may bother some but never gave me much of a second thought.  That product worked OK for me, though I have a feeling that old tales of using the same shampoo too often leads to build-up and lack of response/performance for the product and I often wind up using a different product to come along and get in one last lather and rinse.  Either way, that was good enough and seemed to give reasonable results -- except for the continuing loss of hair in spots where there had been some previously.  No, the shampoo wasn't burning away the hair follicles, it was just father time smacking me around and reminding me that I should consider myself lucky that I have not wound up as hairless as my grandfather on the maternal side was at this stage of my life.Having just started using this product, I have to be serious and say that no, there isn't a new forest of hair up there, at least not yet.  Nor, would I expect one to start growing there.  This isn't a hair growth product, rather it is a product that is supposed to clean and nourish your hair and make the hair that is there fuller and thicker.  (Hmm, I seem to recall a spray-on product that did something like that, but looked hideous when it was used ;-) )  As a cleaner, I think this version of H&S works fine.  The smell was a bit different and slightly less pleasant to me compared to the H&S product I had been using, but the clean feeling seemed to kick in at about the same point as the product I was previously using (Lather, Rinse, Repeat once).This comes, at least for the package that I got, as a pretty hefty supply of shampoo.  It would last me many showers worth, so I really can't complain and wouldn't complain about the price point.  You get a fair amount of shampoo for your money.In the end, if Head and Shoulders is a brand you trust, I think you'd be happy with this product (or perhaps the males in your life would be happy with this product as it is aimed primarily at males).  4 solid stars from this reviewer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3MA9G4D7FAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD853J6#wasThisHelpful","R3R3MA9G4D7FAQ","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While some may look back at the Harley-Davidson #1 days with less than fond memories, the Red, White & Blue #1 with the Stars and Stripes makes me think of the days of Evel Knievel doing stunt jumps on his motorcycles (and his attempt to cross the canyon in the rocket style motorcycle).  (Others may remember this particular style of logo as the days when AMF was ruining their favorite motorcycle manufacturing company.)Regardless of your own particular thoughts of this logo, as a key chain, this one does a good job.  It has a nice feel and gives an impression of being something that will be durable.  I have minor concerns that the chain may break over time and drop the logo along the way (I've had that happen in the past with a Coca-Cola logo key chain), but I think this key chain will hold up fairly well.If the logo appearance is important to the buyer, I think buyers will be happy with this key chain.  It looks exactly as you see in the item picture, has a nice shine and doesn't have a cheap or rushed appearance in the logo, the lettering or the color areas (there is no bleed-over from one color area to the next, as an example).Given the typical H-D 'tax' one might expect to pay for officially logo'd or licensed products, this item comes in at a reasonable pricing level.  I've seen relatively cheap looking plastic logo items sell for nearly as much and know from experience that they don't last long as the paint on those wears off quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFBE7OBO704/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N31N988#wasThisHelpful","RWFBE7OBO704","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Netgear N300 Wi-Fi router comes in at a very budget friendly price point, priced inexpensively enough to quickly inspire questions as to why it is so relatively inexpensive.  For the most part, those questions could be ignored, though not completely so as in the end the old adage about getting what you paid for probably applies here.  Performance wise this router is OK at best, but slows quickly when trying to use more than a few devices at the same time.  Similarly, the wireless coverage areas that this router provides is not that impressive and someone that hopes to provide wireless connectivity to a whole home would likely be somewhat disappointed as I found myself being.3 stars for an OK router, but asking for anything more than just OK would likely lead to disappointment and a return trip to find a router that performs better with more devices in use, or a router that provides a more sizable coverage range for the wireless network.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FC8R0ZOP162M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJYEI#wasThisHelpful","R2FC8R0ZOP162M","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice and durable toy block set and as a nice bonus it includes a wooden box/tray to put the pieces back into - the only problem being that the pieces don't have form fitted trays within the wood box/tray to actually snap or sit back in, which leaves the high probability that the pieces aren't going to be put back as neatly as they otherwise might.  One solution that might work there is that parents can take a picture of the set before they take the blocks out of the case the first time, then at least there would be a picture to reference for what goes where in the box if you want it back the way it started out.  Alternatively, you can place the individual blocks into bags for storage and just ignore the wooden tray (or use the wooden tray as a base to stand the blocks up in).The recommended age for this set starts at 3 years and up.  I think that number is a bit conservative as this set is easily durable enough to work well for younger ages, though of course playtime should be supervised and you shouldn't give pieces that might be a choking hazard to small children.The picture book that is included is a very nice addition as it sets up the possibility of sharing the play experience with a youngster that is going to be playing with the blocks, whether that shared experience is between older siblings and younger siblings, or between parents and children.Nicely priced, and durable enough to last through several children's playtimes.  Easily 4 solid stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5TOCP8RME9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GEH8DU#wasThisHelpful","RR5TOCP8RME9H","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I requested this item as something that I hoped one of my favorite guest product tester/reviewers (my daughter) would put through the wringer.  She, having recently upgraded phones to an iPhone 6, had been a longtime user of Otter products (for her iPhone 5).  The Otter case that she used with her iPhone 5 saved that phone multiple times and given the durability of the cases she used, she was happy to continue to rely on Otter products for her new precious.  That said, she was also very willing to give this Speck case a try as she was growing tired of the bulkiness that the Otterbox that she had been using added to her phone.She noted that she really liked the sleekness of this product.  It is thinner and less bulky compared to the Otterbox and yet she felt that this case still offered a high level of protection for the phone it encases.  She liked the looks, clearly aimed at younger people with the bright colors.  If she had to make a choice between this case and an Otterbox, her opinion was that she'd be glad to consider this option.  If the difference in price wasn't that significant she would likely stick with Otter as she has known their products longer and has found them highly reliable.My own experience with Speck products goes back to products that I had back when I had an older iPhone.  I liked the Speck case that I had though I wouldn't have categorized it as being as protective as the Otterbox product that I later went on to use and depend upon.This one rates at a solid 4 star level.  It looks nice and is good at doing the job it is intended for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DYPPVKHOR9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON39CQ8#wasThisHelpful","R36DYPPVKHOR9V","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This turntable looks great and makes me wish that I still had more of the albums that I used to have, though the turntables I had back in the day did more than enough damage to those albums to make me glad that I've switched primarily to digital versions of the music that I favor.Don't get me wrong, I like music on vinyl, but there were plenty of reasons to switch to digital and those reasons weren't just because of the scratches that would inevitably befall the music I had on vinyl platters.  On the other hand, I would also note that digital lacks something compared to vinyl.  There's just something about putting on a record and setting the needle down gently to play the material that is embedded there-in.  Yes, even with the pops and hiss that might be there.I love the looks of this item.  It is aesthetically pleasing and fits very nicely into the area where I reserved space for it. It really does seem like a work of art (sculpture style).Setup of this device was simple, and using this device is also very user friendly.  Really there's not much to not like about this turntable.  Not quite perfect, but really, really nice.  4 solid stars for me, and a big salute to TEAC for helping to keep vinyl alive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTJURSS2WJIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9WK1BW#wasThisHelpful","R3CTJURSS2WJIZ","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review has been prepared by a special guest reviewer.  My daughter, who has significantly more hair to be concerned with taking care of.  ( As I'm getting older the amount of hair I've got up there keeps dwindling, seemingly replaced with hair in other places :-/ )  While I could use this product, I really couldn't give it the kind of test that my daughter could, hence the bottle was handed to her to allow her to do her best (or worst) with.  Her comments follow:I hopped on the dry shampoo band wagon a couple years ago and have since been on the hunt for that one dry shampoo that does it all. You could rattle off a list of brand names (high end or drug store) and ask me if I've tried them, and my answer would probably be yes to all. Even with high end brands I've had the constant issue of that white, powdery residue being left behind.I've been a long time fan of aussie products however, so I was hoping this one wouldn't be a let down. Much to my relief, it wasn't. I sprayed a bit at my roots and gently massaged into my scalp like I would with normal shampoo. No white residue, no stickiness or greasiness. It left my hair soft and more voluminous. Only thing that may bother someone is the fact that it has a fruity scent, and it does linger throughout the day. For me personally, I'll take the artificial fruity scent if it means having a great time saver like this around.Summary: 4 - 5 star range depending on how much you might like the scent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVAX5FWOO9DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP23U24#wasThisHelpful","R2LVAX5FWOO9DQ","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this product though I'd have to say that I'm not sure I'd really like to have to carry one of these items in my already overloaded bag of electronics and gadgets that travel with me.  It isn't that big, nor that heavy, but by the time I bag up the various chargers and adapters, along with the cables and then the actual devices, I wind up walking around with enough weight that I think carrying around a 16-pound bowling ball would be the easier task.This little gadget works for the task that is intended, though like another reviewer here noted, be careful not to jam it in too far lest you find yourself having trouble getting it out from under the door.One other thought with this gadget - I'd really like to hope that I wouldn't need something like this for most of my travels.  If I think the area I'm staying in isn't that safe and secure then I'd more likely check-out and move to a safer area.

"By now you've likely seen a ton of negative reviews and/or comments noting that the makers of TurboTax have apparently gotten a little, well, greedy.  Features that used to exist in the Deluxe level now require upgrading to the Premiere level.  Depending on how much you complain you can probably find an inexpensive upgrade to get back the features you need, but in reality it seems that plenty of people got upset at having to pay more for what they used to get or having to complain to get those features back no matter what had to be done to do so.  I'm trying to be fair here in noting that for an average user, the features that were taken away from the Deluxe version of this software probably aren't needed, but average is a highly unpredictable thing and many people might find that they actually do need those missing features and now they are expected to pay more to get it or switch to a competing product.Realistically both products won't see serious use from me for a few more weeks.  Once employers make the earnings statements available I'll get to spend serious time working on returns and determining the good or bad news about the tax situation for my family.  While I hope for good news in that area, I'm also hopeful that Intuit will yet again learn the lessons of not upsetting their customer base.  We'll see about that in future years though, assuming I continue to willing to give them a chance.I would note that at least one competing product (the HR Block application, for example) seems to be making a serious push to take advantage of the possible mis-steps here by Intuit.  I can't say that I blame them as it surely seems to be a golden opportunity (some people might remember how ""New Coke"" helped Pepsi make inroads against their competition) handed to them.I suppose I could have come here and chewed Intuit a new one like others have, plopping a one-star review here and just moving on but I'd prefer to be honest in my review and note the issues that I have with the product rather than just dog-piling on here.I've been a user of TurboTax for many years now.  Long enough to remember more than just this current year's issues with the application and stupid things that Intuit has done.  (I remember a big fuss over the equivalent of a root-kit that was installed compliments of one year's version of the product.  Apparently current management doesn't remember that mistake as they make a similarly upsetting move with this year's product differences compared to last years :-/ )  Given this year's mis-steps, and some problems I had with last year's product, I'm not sure I would remain a TurboTax user.  I seriously had intended to switch to a competing product this year (that earlier mentioned HR Block software, already purchased as part of an Amazon Gold Box deal not so long ago).  I felt forced into using that product last year (and I did buy it last year) as I had issues with a never fixed 'bug' in last year's TurboTax software.  While last year's taxes were a little more complex for my family than a typical year, they shouldn't have been that confusing and yet last year TurboTax caused me a lot of grief with my state tax filings and in the end caused a serious delay in getting the refund I was due.I hope this year's version is better in that area but won't know for sure until a few weeks from now when I have all of the required paperwork in hand.  Given that I have both the HR Block product for this year and the copy of this year's TurboTax product to double check things with, I am pretty sure I'll be able to e-file this season without issue as one product or another will work for me I'm sure.I have installed both products and have a couple of thoughts about both that I'll put here.  Both products irritated me a bit as they both wanted my personal information for product registration and/or activation (HR Block wants an activation code to be entered).  Neither product was smart enough to actually look for last year's tax return files to grab my personal information from to pre-fill that information out.  Given that a few steps later in the process the applications both read last year's returns and import personal information from same it seems both could make a little more effort to save customers time in that area.  I can note that the Block product didn't ask the questions about what product I used last year and/or where I purchased my products from.  It really doesn't take long to complete the information but it bugs me that I have to sit and type in information that is there for the taking if the apps used a smarter process for starting up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BMT8DVLED01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYXTCGY#wasThisHelpful","R18BMT8DVLED01","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I requested this device I noted that it discussed both Apple iOS and Android (it's even part of the item title).  When I received the device I had to do a double check as the package that I received doesn't discuss Android at all.  There's plenty of mention of iOS and/or the Apple App store, but not a single logo on the package for Android, the Google Play store, or anything else android related.I can go to www.getqardio.com/devices to get a list of devices that I can use this item with and yes, it lists my Samsung Galaxy smart phone among the devices that I can use it with, but that list of devices is definitely shallow.  I can understand not having had the time to get every possible Android device tested and I can even understand that some of the requirements may limit their list of supported devices due to newer Bluetooth features that might not exist in older Android devices, but I'm left with the thought that perhaps the company should be aiming at two different but very similar devices - one that is sold for iOS users and one that is sold for Android users; each with separate packaging and marketing.Beyond those issues, this is an interesting device.  I like the idea of being able to record information that can be used to check for patterns and patient history.  I can certainly see where that could be very useful for anyone that should be tracking their blood pressure on a regular basis (and even if you haven't been told to do so, it is still a great idea to check your blood pressure regularly).This device looks nice, ships in a nice little paper/cardboard can package, and comes with a manual and single sheet quick start/introduction to the device.  The quick start page uses color headlines that I suspect were supposed to be printed in the same color within the manual.  Apparently someone opted to print the manuals without color (except for the cover page) and that seems to have resulted in several spots within the manual being harder to read as the gray scale printing for the original color is light and harder to see than it otherwise would have been.Please realize that I'm seeing what might be a pre-release item and as such you may not find the same issues with a purchased product.This item falls into solid 3 star territory for me.

"A small pet peeve for me is when manufacturers use the same manual for multiple devices but then don't have the manuals clearly point out all of the differences between the devices... so, you wind up wondering how something was supposed to be rather than being able to clearly find out from looking at the instructions.  Realistically, I'm a guy, and as a guy, well, I don't want to lose my guy card by having to read instructions but there are times when having a line or two of instructions or a picture or two worth can go a long way to putting things together correctly.In the case of this device, assembly was fairly simple and for the most part I didn't feel as if I had to check the instructions at all, except, well, to confirm that I didn't need to put in any screws or bolts to hold things together.  Since I hadn't found any of those items as I unboxed this beast, it was a pretty safe assumption that none should be needed, but then again when you are literally snapping things together you question a bit as to whether or not there should be something locking the connected pieces into place.  Even without screws, pins, bolts or other items to lock the pieces together, this Upright Vacuum feels sturdy enough for use just about anywhere in the manufacturer's intended target areas.With assembly issues discussed, it's time to move on and ask the question of how well this vacuum works to pull up dirt, fuzz, hair and other things from your floors or other target areas.  The manufacturer states that this device works better than a competitors products do.  I'm not sure they are wrong in making that boast, though I'd have to see some objective measurement that backs up that claim.  Truth be told, I expect either manufacturer could put together a test that shows their product bests the other, leaving the performance area pretty much a tie.One thought from my own personal preferences is that I wish that the cord and retractor were higher up in the upper portion of the device.  I prefer to have the cord well up and out of the way as I vacuum.  With this device the cord is mounted fairly lowly in the upright portion of the device and that tends to have the cord in an area that annoys me as it feels like I'm being tied up by the cord as I go through the home vacuuming up the floors.4 solid stars as this device seems to be not quite perfect, but yet very nice, for use around my home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IAHYHAG5QHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXB4XRW#wasThisHelpful","R32IAHYHAG5QHH","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was super excited about this product when it was initially going to be a project at one of the large crowd funding sites.  I loved the idea of how it would work and really liked the thought that it would just plain work and not require myself or others in the household to remember to change the magnetic sign that we hang on the door or pay attention to the light that shows that the dishes were washed (as soon as someone opens the door to the dishwasher that light goes out, so it isn't reliable if someone doesn't put the dishes away after opening the door).The problem that keeps me from giving this five stars is that this little gadget is a bit touchy about placement within the dishwasher and for some potential users it may keep this from being a usable solution at all.  Basically the gadget needs to be placed somewhere it will get covered with plenty of water.  Without enough water to float the indicator there's no way to get the gadget to register at all, so if you over-fill your dishwasher or if your dishwasher is super-efficient and doesn't use much water you may find that you aren't able to use this gadget at all.During the first few weeks of use in my household we had mixed results.  It was a little frustrating given the hope and faith I was wanting to place in this gadget.  I contacted the manufacturer/inventor and got some feedback that mentioned the placement of the gadget and how important it is to get a lot of water flow in and immediately around the device.  The suggestions pointed me in the right direction for making it work more reliably, though I would note that given my spousal units propensity to crowd things into the dishwasher and possibly block things a bit from larger objects placed in front of smaller ones, it hasn't been that easy to find a spot to place this gadget that works 100% of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBEGOBFL90QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQGIIPI#wasThisHelpful","RFBEGOBFL90QK","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small, but not really all that light (which affects portability) { side note: it seems a little odd to complain about weight and portability for a device that only weighs a few pounds, especially from someone (me) that remembers the older days of 'luggable' computers that weighed well more than a typical bowling ball would, but this is the world we now live in.  If it weighs more than a few ounces it gives us pause and we get distracted by how much something weighs and complain about it. }Sound quality is acceptable for my taste, but not so impressive to make me love this product.  For the price point that this product is sitting at, I think many people might expect better sound quality and may find themselves a bit disappointed.Build quality seems good, appearance is acceptable as an accessory that will be sitting out in your environment somewhere within range of whatever device you are using to stream content from.Pairing the device is very easy and should not cause problems for most typical users.  Realistically, if you can't figure out how to pair this device then you really must be technologically challenged.Power supply issues may confuse some users.  Don't assume that this device can be charged from any potential charger.  It is apparently power hungry and may not charge at all if you aren't using the charger that it comes with.  While other chargers may work in its place, you will likely find that using an alternate charger may not feed this thing enough juice to actually charge it up.  Given that this device can be used to charge other devices (such as a smart phone) from its own USB port, it kind of makes sense that it might take a bit more power to actually charge it up.  Mark the power supply if possible and keep it where you can find it if you intend to use this device frequently.Note this is a mono and not a stereo output device.  You can use more than one to get stereo sound, but that would obviously double the cost which could get awfully spendy given this device's own price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJSW27MDRRPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUBFAQK#wasThisHelpful","R3CJSW27MDRRPC","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd just about give my right arm to be able to use half stars in the ratings here, as this isn't quite a 4 star item for me, but then again it is better than 3 stars.  What keeps it from being more solidly in the 4 star territory?  The idea that it just doesn't wow me that much more than a less expensive sister product in the Brother label maker line.Back over the spring/summer of this past year I picked up a similar product, also made by Brother, from one of the large office product retail chain (immediate need and sale pricing won out over purchasing from my favored retailer :-( though this favored retailer won out when I requested purchase of two of the same device for use in the office).  The version that I had picked up wasn't PC connectable so it didn't offer any of those features, but as a basic label maker it worked well and was considerably less expensive compared to this model.This model is nice, and if I considered the 'suggested retail price point' for this model and that one, there isn't that much difference between the two and realistically I'd probably say spend the extra just in case you do want the PC Connectable features later, but... well, the PC Connectible features may not add that much for most users and with that considered it probably makes the less spendy versions a better fit.In either case expect to wind up paying for the label tape as you'll find it doesn't last long at all.  About the time you get started labeling the things you want to you'll find the tape gone and the job only half done (if that).  In other words, buy additional tape at time of purchase.  You'll need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I26P0OUWWHMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEKCCQ#wasThisHelpful","R3I26P0OUWWHMZ","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I noted in the subject for this review that these are value priced but not necessarily a better value than other choices.  I reached that conclusion by comparing these against a set of Sony headphones that I recently over-paid for (not really, they were priced similarly to these headphones) back when I was travelling on vacation with my daughter.  Having forgotten to grab a set of headphones or earphones before reaching the airport I wanted something that would be comfortable for use on the plane and having a preference for over the ear rather than in the ear the Sony headphones that I picked up were the only somewhat reasonably priced choice I had (outside of grabbing some cheap earbuds).In any case, I did use those Sony headphones for the duration of the trip and they worked well but weren't really what I would term high quality for sound and comfort.  They were fairly basic and probably should have been sold for about 1/3 less than what the airport vendor was charging for them, which is about 1/3 less than what this set of Pioneer Headphones seems to go for here at Amazon.Compared to those Sony headphones, this set of headphones is more comfortable for my taste, but still could be better and more comfortable.  Sound quality wise, these sound OK to me, but didn't wow me as much as I might have hoped for.  Not bad, but not so impressive either.  Factoring in the price point, I'd say they deliver what I might expect but not much more.In the end, I'd put these in the 3.5 star territory.  Good, solid, value priced, but not something I would necessarily consider my be-all, end-all headphone set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUA03VWQ0UYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLX0AW#wasThisHelpful","R1YUA03VWQ0UYG","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is going to be one of those times when some people will look at my Vine Review badge and probably figure that I was looking a gift horse in the mouth as this review isn't as favorable as some might expect (given that yes, I am review 'free' product that was provided by the vendor).While I don't want to be too negative (I try to be optimistic), there are a few things with this item that cause me to drop the rating and urge caution for any potential purchaser.  First up, I have to say that the directions that are included are somewhat sparse.  Yes, I would admit and acknowledge that if you visit the manufacturer's website, or especially if YOU search for that TUBE site where you can find so darned many videos that you'll probably find some very useful and helpful videos that are meant to teach a beginner how to use this item.  I appreciate the existence of the videos but found them to be a bit too simplistic as they skip over some things and just presume or assume that the viewer will put things together enough to get through the steps as easily as the person who was making the videos had.Normally I lean on my guy-card credentials and try to take the approach that instructions are for the weak, but this device and its controls are far from simplistic enough to just jump in and start flying (though I would admit that I did try taking that approach just to see what the results might be, and no, those results and the frustration from that approach aren't why I'm giving this middle-of-the-road rating to this device).I think a novice can learn how to work with this device, but in demonstrating it and working with it while around friends, we each came to the conclusion that it doesn't work nearly as easily as we might hope or expect.  Now, with that said, the fact that it 'takes off' and hovers in place puts it well ahead of some other RC copters and drone type devices that I have had in the past.  My frustrations with them often stemming from the fact that they don't work nearly as well as the demonstration units that one would see while walking through the mall areas ever do.Once the drone is flying, my own opinion, and that of the friends that were testing it with me, is that the controls for forward and back motion are slow to respond to.  While I appreciate caution in such things, the delay in the response means users like me wind up giving the drone the commands to fly forward more frequently than we should and the device winds up slamming into a wall or flying farther or backwards compared to where the pilot would expect it to go.  More responsiveness would be useful for sure.A few suggestions for the manufacturers: update your documentation to make the links to your website nice and bold.  Direct people to the website for clear step-by-step instructions on how to update the firmware, and how to start using the device.  Add the same website link to the box the device is shipped in as well just to make the point that a purchaser should start there.Additionally, it would be nice if the manufacturer included a spare blade or two in the package.  I appreciate that spare parts can be purchased from the manufacturer, and it is nice that they are easily replaced.  They do seem fairly durable, and yet not indestructible, hence the idea that a spare or two would be nice to have.  The body of the drone is durable as are the the legs and frame that the motors and blades are on.  The large wheels that are included with this rolling spider also seem fairly durable based on my own testing, though the blades can impact things and get bent up and damaged even if the wheels are on the drone.In the end I think this is a nice device, but it is not a toy and is not something that I would expect to be durable enough to be played with by younger persons who may not work with one as cautiously as would be required with this device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11V9HBQH5F8T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZM53NC#wasThisHelpful","R11V9HBQH5F8T5","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first thought, this was a 'woohoo! a Star Wars version of Army men', but upon closer inspection and further investigation, I'm not sure this set and others in the same series are really all that great.  Oh, for a Star Wars collector/fan, certainly there is value added, but as a toy with long term playability, in that area I'm really not so sure.It is cool to think that you have a remote control to 'use the force' to knock down the figures with, but the remote control works OK at best, and could be frustrating for kids to figure out.  Think of it in the same manner you might think of the old vibrating electronic football sets where you were happy to see movement of some sort but couldn't count on that movement playing out in the manner you wished for.  While that may lead some to use more imagination and perhaps to being an opportunity to be an optimist in how this set works, I think reality is more on the side of this being something that gets played with a little and then somewhat cast to the side just because it is almost too much work to use in the manner it was intended.Having multiple sets with different ships and figures available is very nice, and having any of those items relatively reasonably priced is also nice, but buying more than a few sets can start adding up the costs quickly and again just how much playability can be had from any of these sets?  That really depends on the imagination and patience levels of the kids you give the sets to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCXR5DITX0574/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILA2766#wasThisHelpful","RCXR5DITX0574","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so close to giving this the 4 star rating, but in reality the only reason I might knock a star off for this item is because of how heavy it is, which in reality is far more of a plus rather than a minus.  The weight is an issue for lugging it around and getting it ready to install in a vehicle, but once installed it should pretty much remain in place and from that point on the weight factors in just how sturdy and durable this item is.  It is made to last and the quality shines through.  While I can't promise I'd be back later to confirm that it really did last the touted 12 years, I suspect strongly that I could come back in 12 years and say positively that it really did last that long and would likely still have years of service left if someone really wanted to use it.  (Note: I would not recommend trying to use it beyond the rated life cycle as some materials do wear with time and the crash protection level could be compromised if used beyond the intended life span)This convertible booster seat delivers on its promises and is a very, very nice child safety seat.  It is, as one more potential, a little spendy but when it comes to safety for your children and/or loved ones (for those buying for grandchildren, or nieces or nephews, etc.) can you really put a price on safety?It is very comforting to know that when the youngsters in our family are being driven around that they are going to be comfortable and well protected while in this booster.  While my generation may have survived standing up on the back seat, leaning over the front bench seat screaming in our parents ears as we demanded to know 'are we there yet?', taking those sorts of chances with our children or our children's children is not recommended.Lots of other options exist within the market space for this item, and many of them are far less spendy, but they may not last nearly as long and/or my not be nearly as durable as this item is.  They all are made with the goal of protecting the occupant in case of a crash, but the materials and construction for many of the other options are just not nearly as nice as what Diono has delivered here.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend one of the other options, it just means that given the choice, I would be happy to have this Diono seat or happy to see it used by anyone that I knew needed one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5169WZJATHVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS2QIK#wasThisHelpful","R5169WZJATHVX","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is OK, but I just can't get myself much more excited about it.  It works as intended, in most cases, but it may come at the expense of blocking the air flow coming out of the vent that you attach it to.  It is nice that it allows the phone device that it is holding to be easily rotated, and it opens relatively wide so it will hold a good sized phone device (such as a Samsung Galaxy S5, my phone device of choice), but it doesn't wow me to the point of giving more than a 3 star rating.

"Fun to build, though it can be a little frustrating trying to assemble in spots as things are more fragile at times then you might want to encounter.  Not terribly fragile, but enough that you might find yourself frustrated trying to get some pieces together without having other pieces knocked off.  If you are cautious and patient (not always a trait that I'm personally good with ;-) ) then it really isn't that bad, though noticeable enough that I felt it worthy of mention here.The finished product looks pretty cool and does remind me, as a player of the videogame that provided the inspiration, of the videogame.  It also provides a cool item for someone interested in the space program (who may not even care about the videogame) to build and display, though of course it is based entirely on a fictitious space weapons system, not on any real (at least not that we know of) satellite in the known U.S. space fleet.4 solid stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WP7EFAA0X17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J05N0BM#wasThisHelpful","R2WP7EFAA0X17","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't help but think of say the baby that used to advertise for a certain stock market buying/selling/trading company, standing up, holding onto the side, and perhaps doing one of those old fashioned ""Let me out of here!!!"" chants while standing in this play yard.  About as soon as I think that though, I think wow, if that was truly the situation, I'd feel a bit sorry for the toddler and the relatively small space it was confined in.This is a nice play yard, but it is not terribly big.  The trade-off has already been made in making this particular play yard smaller, more portable, and lighter and easier to carry than one that would be bigger.  For a single baby, this would be OK, and mothers that want something smaller and lighter will certainly be happy, but if you have more than one child you might think of using this with, then please look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV36MS2FA48BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJIXP1S#wasThisHelpful","RV36MS2FA48BK","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If not for the form factor this might be close to 5 stars from me.  It works well, doesn't look that bad in the white color, but the form factor that was chosen that makes it inconvenient to even consider using anywhere you can't find the room for it to stand up as it was designed for winds up costing this device a bit in my book.  While some might point at me and say the problem is mine, and that I should just reconsider where I would place the device, things aren't always so simple.  The location that I had been using a different router in is one that was on the shelf right below my TV.  If I were to place this device into the same space that was so nicely used before, I'd wind up with the antennas sitting up blocking part of the lower part of the TV screen.  Trying to place the device on a lower shelf isn't much better as the clearance height on the lower shelves is a bit lower and not to easy to place this device in.Beyond the form factor issue, this is a solid product.  The Wi-Fi signal that it delivers is good.  Not necessarily great, but solid in comparison to other routers that I've used in the home.  Wired Gigabit speed is a must have for me, and this router delivers solidly in that area.  The availability of a 'Guest' network is also really nice and can help alleviate concerns that someone that comes into your home could be gaining more access to your network than you would otherwise want to allow.The manual could use a bit more work and shows room for improvement, but the materials that are provided in the box and/or found at the manufacturer's web site are sufficient for most users to find what they need in.  If I had to note the expected user level for this item, I would go with novice or above, and not necessarily beginner.  While anyone should be able to use this router and get it working, a true beginner might find the setup process a bit more technically confusing with this product than other options that are available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYQV5MENNXED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2ROH0C#wasThisHelpful","R2SYQV5MENNXED","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've previously gotten plastic shelf liners that I'm still using several cabinets.  I liked those particular plastic liners because they featured ridges and troughs that let any moisture that might have remained on dishes that were being put away collect without worrying about possibly damaging the shelves.  The cost on those liners seemed comparable to these, and the ease of cutting those liners was similar since the ridges worked well for providing guides and cut lines.These liners definitely have an advantage in cutting them to fit since the pattern on them offers cutting guides in almost any direction you'd care to use.  They are also easily machine washable compared to the plastic liners where you must wipe them down or scrub them by hand (with a brush, sponge or similar cleaning tool).For me, these are nice, functional and reliable shelf liners.  Not really something that I'd normally get overly excited about, but definitely something that I appreciate having around.(I would note my excitement level for these might be a bit higher were it not for the idea that the installation of these liners may lead to a long list of honey-do items being brought along for the ride ;-)  That whole 'while we're doing this, how about we go ahead and get this done too' type thing :-/ )","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OKUQ7S63YKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVMOKJ0#wasThisHelpful","R30OKUQ7S63YKY","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's somewhat ironic that this showed up for me as an Amazon Vine offering *after* I had already ordered and received a 'Premium Value pack' version of this same product, along with a host of additional items including the Guardians of the Galaxy play set and a few extra figurines and power discs.  I was, obviously, all-in on Infinity 2.0, though I hadn't let myself get pulled into the Infinity world back in the 1.0 version other than to collect a couple of the figurines.Disney Infinity, even in that earlier rendition, was somewhat ingenious (one of my friends and I were using the word devious) in how it appeals on so many levels.  Disney collectors can collect the figures just to display while others may be collecting the figures both for use in the game and for display and collecting.  Throw in the power discs and the play sets that offer new areas to play in and the appeal broadens further, and beyond that there's the Toy box mode for even more appeal and potential gaming satisfaction.This starter pack offers gamers what they would need to get started in Disney Infinity 2.0's Marvel environment.  3 of the now infamous Marvel heroes are included: Thor, Ironman, and Black Widow.  Each nicely done though missing one key aspect that some collectors might look for as they are not movable (non-articulated) in their poses.  They are not exactly like their movie representations, but are close enough to both the movies and the comics to be instantly recognizable.For those that aren't familiar with the Disney Infinity environment, the figures double as your playing piece for use in the video game environment.  Players pick one of the figures to use to select that character within the gaming environment and then place that figure on the Infinity base which is connected to the gaming console.  The Infinity base reads electronics that are in the base of the figure (or in the power discs) to determine which character should be used as which player in the game, or which additional options should be available to that player within the game.  The Infinity base has two separate player slots on it, and a third spot for where the play set activator goes.  The play set activator determines where the players will be playing, or which story the players will be working within.With the 2.0 series, the Marvel Super Heroes move into the spotlight, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  More play sets will be available along the way as each play set offers yet more playability to gamers and also offers Disney the opportunity to sell more of the collectible figures.  With the 1.0 series Infinity seemed to be oriented much more towards younger children while the 2.0 series opens up lots of possibility for (Marvel) comics fanboys (and girls) of all ages.Fans of the comic book characters get to explore the environment and smash, bash, blast and shoot bad guys as they work to save the universe from the evil that would otherwise rule.  The only real problem in that area, and one that helps lead to the less than 5 star rating here, is that the play set environments and stories are fairly short.  Serious gamers will fly through (no pun intended there) the play set within a 4 - 5 hour period in many cases and then be left feeling that they got ripped off a little on the game playability.  Having other play sets available helps to eliminate that problem, but those play sets typically come at a cost of approximately 1/2 of the price of the original starter pack.  (Of course the play sets also include additional figures which would normally sell separately for about 1/2 the cost of a play set)Fans of the Disney Infinity 1.0 series, or people that had collected the figures and play sets will find that they can use the figures within the toy box mode when playing in the Infinity 2.0 environment.  The play sets from 1.0 are not compatible with 2.0, and the figures and play sets from 2.0 are not backwards compatible with the 1.0 environment.  In some instances the 2.0 figures may not be completely cross compatible with all of the play sets (as an example, the Hulk character can't be used in all of the 2.0 play sets, and the Rocket character from Guardians doesn't work in all environments either).For those that aren't aware, there is a Collector's edition (PlayStation 3 or 4 only) that adds a display base.  That display base is NOT used within the game, rather it just offers a nice base to display your figures on.  That set also includes the otherwise as yet unavailable (outside of auctions and third party sales) Hulk figure.  That figure will be available for separate sale late October 2014.One other consideration that comes into mind is that in order to use this item you'll need to have room for setting the Infinity base up and will also need a USB port available on your PS4 (also compatible with the PS3, though then you'd need the software for same) to plug your base into.  If you are space constrained in the area where your console is set up, you may find it frustrating having to plug the Infinity base in.  You can plug the base into a USB hub if you want/need to, but that would add the need to purchase same (separately).Besides the somewhat disappointing play set average game times, the cost of buying the power discs and figures and/or the pre-arranged packages of figures that don't always include the combination of characters you might otherwise have preferred factors into the not quite perfect 5.0 rating here.  I do like being able to mix and match by getting separate figures and play sets, but those costs do keep adding up.  In the end, this sits squarely in the 4 star range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34JV9U8TEM5WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWHOXGI#wasThisHelpful","R34JV9U8TEM5WM","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to snicker a bit as I read the note that Amazon is showing me about this item not fitting my Harley Dyna Super Glide.  Uh, really?  I have it mounted there already and had no problems at all mounting it there (well, except that I stripped the bolt and then wound up breaking the one that came with this pedal pad and instead had to use the one from the old pedal pad that was being replaced).Of course the reason it fits so nicely may be that the prior owner had gotten several upgrades done on the bike when he owned it, including several Kuryakyn components (including the smaller version of this brake pedal pad).  My only real complaint about these pedal pads is that part of the reason that I was replacing this pedal pad is because one of the rubber pads on the original pedal pad was lost just a few days back.  I'm not sure what happened to that rubber pad other than the glue and sticky material that was holding it just wearing out, but the missing piece sent me here to find a replacement pedal pad.  Since I was doing the replacement, I opted to add this Longhorn version which adds more surface area to the brake pedal for my big feet to more easily hit.I like the looks of this Brake Pedal pad, and prior to having lost one of the rubber pads from the old ISO Brake Pedal Pad, had really liked the one that was on the bike previously.  It was not terribly spendy and it does make a pretty nice customization for any bike.

I like the looks, though not having been the original owner of my Harley, I have to admit that the Kuryakyn mods were chosen by the prior owner so I was just replacing the same basic item with a newer one (which I had to replace after laying the bike down back in the spring).Replacing this shift peg is a simple enough task, and I like the Longhorn peg for the extra length which leaves it easier to maneuver my big feet on.  I also like that I could find replacement pads for this shift peg after I did lose one as that saved me from having to buy yet another shift peg.  Finally, I like the fairly reasonable cost for this replacement shift peg.  If the pads were stuck on the peg with some adhesive before the item was packaged, I think it would be a higher rated product for me.  As is, I would recommend getting some Gorilla Glue super glue or something similar to use to make sure the pads adhere to the peg; otherwise expect to need to purchase some replacement pads sooner rather than later.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFEK5GOG7DXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KPUIWS#wasThisHelpful","R3CFEK5GOG7DXM","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit irritated at having to buy these replacement rubber pads, though I'm glad that they were available so I didn't have to (instead) buy a new shifter peg since I had only recently purchased the one that I wound up buying these pads for.  Replacing the missing pad was easy enough, though I chose to combine one of these replacement pads with some Gorilla Glue (super glue) that I hope will keep the newly replaced pad in place for a long time.  I did take the precaution of wiping down the shifter peg good before hitting it with the Gorilla Glue, then placed the new pad in place.The new pad isn't as worn as the pads that have been in place over the last several weeks, so it isn't as weather faded.  It doesn't look bad, but the better recommendation would likely be to replace all of the pads at the same time if you are concerned about keeping the pads well matched.I can say that the pads that have stayed on the shifter (and had stayed on the brake pedal) have held up well, though I also wound up ordering a new brake pedal after losing one of the pads on it at about the same time I lost the pad on the shifter peg.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV9B6W8D132B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JT0OQQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV9B6W8D132B","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute toy, with bright colors that instantly draw your eyes to it, and it also offers up the promise that it can be played with on both wet or dry surfaces, but the reality is running it in water will leave users a bit frustrated because it tends not to be driven/powered in any sort of controllable fashion.  While the marketing materials and blurbs on the box say it will work in water, work is just not the term that I would use here.  More like it will run while in water, but not be steerable or powered well enough to control well once it is sitting in water.  Riding it through a puddle where the wheels can still touch the bottom and get traction is fine (though it will catch water in the toy that would eventually need to be dumped out).  Riding it through sand and dirt would likely result in the dirt being pulled into the toy and eventually fouling up the toy for future use.Controls are not quite as intuitive as one would hope.  It is hard to describe other than to say that even with practice, controlling this toy will be a bit of a challenge.  Kids will have to be patient (and how often is that happening?!? ;-) ) as they try to make the toy go the way they want.  Young children may not care, older children may be frustrated by the lack of control, and older children (approaching teenage) would likely look at this toy and think it is more for younger children.If used primarily indoors, I think this might last a good while.  Taken indoors and outdoors, I'd expect it to break down faster than purchasers might like.  3 middle of the road stars for this toy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W516LJJYPVUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR2Q3E8#wasThisHelpful","R2W516LJJYPVUW","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My step-daughter recently had to give up her nasal spray habit and lay off all of the allergy meds she'd be taking as she and her mother (wife 2.0) went off to get updated testing for allergies done.  The allergist required a week of no use of allergy meds (or at least no meds that included antihistamines) and that was leaving my step-daughter a bit frustrated as her breathing was impacted, along with the extra itchiness and irritants to her skin and eyes that was floating in the air.Now, I must admit to being a little less sympathetic towards her allergies considering she seems to pour an abundance of perfumes and chemical smells on herself, or light up enough candles to light up a minor ballpark just because she likes the scents; meanwhile her mother gets a whiff of any of the above and nearly has an asthma attack due to those irritants.  Of course mom's health doesn't really matter as the personal satisfaction of smelling like you have something to hide is more important don't you know?In any case, about the time that the allergy testing and week of no meds was hitting this little device arrived from Amazon and was instantly deployed into step-daughter's room.  The size of the room is about perfect for the stated capacity and ability of this device.  Step-daughter loves the fact that it has a timer function so she can set it up for use for a few hours as she goes to bed.  Her mother and I like the fact that it does take a lot of contaminants out of the air.  It can't quite combat the burning candles (or at least we still get plenty of exposure to same when they are burning and the step-daughter's bedroom door is open), but that likely has more to do with the sheer numbers of candles she might light up at a given moment.This device is a bit spendy, but it does seem to work well.  It might wind up helping to break the step-child of the nasal spray habit and if so that would be a great thing.  Of course getting rid of the perfumes and other irritants would be the real answer, but that will continue to go unrecognized no matter how much us old folks try to convince the younger generation that we do actually know best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWF4CPDSRVUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXSBJ7Q#wasThisHelpful","R2AWF4CPDSRVUP","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remember that old saying about if you can't say anything nice?  Uh, yeah, I might be able to stop this review right about here :/I like the idea of this toy and thought it would be cool for fanboys of the Titanfall game to be able to build their own Titan for display, but if you want something to display, you'll need to look around for something other than this frustratingly fragile model.While it is possible to build the model, it is also possible you'll be spending just as much time putting things back together as you did putting them together to begin with, all while trying to assemble the next part of the model.  Just as you put one piece in place, another one you had already put together will come apart and you'll end up cursing this thing more than appreciating it.Nice try, but just not something that most kids would get satisfaction from.  2 generous stars, but really that is a reach.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QCZT5QM6XZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIHN56S#wasThisHelpful","R28QCZT5QM6XZC","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When my internet friends and acquaintances were raving on and on about their support of some Kickstarter project for the PowerCube I was otherwise engaged, uh, distracted, uh, cash strapped and feeling a little let down by having supported some other projects that were delayed and seemingly never coming to fruition.  If I had the funds available, I'm still not sure I would have been a supporter of the project as I just couldn't see that much need for yet another extension cord/power strip in the house.  I have plenty of devices that need to be plugged in, and I have definitely gone out of my way to pick up strips that had plenty of room between the various outlet ports so I could plug in the necessary wall-warts without blocking ports I would eventually wind up needing.One of the more recent power strips that I had gotten was similar to this: Belkin 12 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Telephone and Coaxial Protection (except the one that I had picked up at the local home improvement store also included USB power ports).  That strip was used for the area where my daughter's desktop PC was setup at.  She made use of the USB ports to charge her fruity phone device or her music playing pod device.  It was nice that in doing that she was able to keep some of the otherwise likely used power ports so she could plug in other devices and a/c adapters for charging up some other things as well.That power strip was/is nice, but it eats up a fair amount of floor or desk space as compared to this compact PowerCube device.  Yes it offers up several additional outlets compared to this PowerCube, but given the well-designed modular nature of the PowerCubes, that can be resolved fairly easily (though at additional costs as you add those other PowerCube modules/devices).While I can't discount the use of the larger power strips, I do really like the PowerCube.  I think it works well and do think that the designers delivered on their vision and promises.  If you need a power strip, give the PowerCube serious consideration.  It deserves the 5 stars that I'm giving it here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KHSAQDXYIW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPNH4LC#wasThisHelpful","R35KHSAQDXYIW7","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On my metric bike (an older Suzuki LS model), I had the luxury of having an official manufacturer's toolbag/kit available.  While the toolkit wasn't with that bike at the point I got the bike (used), it was easy enough to find a new replacement set via internet ordering.  With that set and that bike the toolkit has its own area of reserved space on the bike where the toolbag is supposed to be kept.My Harley Dyna doesn't offer up the reserved space, and didn't come with a toolbag/toolkit at all.  With that bike I wanted a set similar to the useful but not too big/heavy toolkit that I had for the Suzuki.  That's where this set comes in nicely.  Since I have saddlebags behind me with plenty of room in the bottom of same, putting a set of these tools (in their nice storage bag) in a semi-permanent home in the saddlebags is an easy enough task.This isn't a set of every tool you'd ever possibly need, but it does include the most frequently used/needed tools and sizes for the wrenches so *most* issues that might require having a set of tools handy can be dealt with even if you were stuck out on the road to nowhere.  Definitely not a substitute for a good roadside assistance program (check with your insurance agent/providers as many may offer such coverage), but for those that know how to turn a wrench or use a screwdriver, it might help get you back on the road a little quicker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R398J7ZFB7HKKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1BT9BW#wasThisHelpful","R398J7ZFB7HKKX","A25QJBK33C4O0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25QJBK33C4O0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice. These pants have a lovely soft finish to the fabric. Like brushed cotton, I suppose. Doesn't look fluffy, but feels fluffy soft. Super comfy.They have a great cut, making them easy to move around in, and very comfortable for lounging and for activities. The elastic at the hems (bottom of the legs) are handy. Not tight (which I wouldn't like) but enough to stop them falling over my shoes and potentially dragging on the ground.The draw string has a nice feature I've not come across before. It actually crosses over at the front (inside the waistband) so when tying it into a bow you just make a bow without first tying a cross-over. Not sure how to explain that, but normally tying a bow requires two steps. One to cross the chords over, and the next to actually form the bow. Because they are already crossed over inside the waistband, you just do step two. Quick and easy. A simple touch, yet it shows the designers of these are actually thinking about how to make their product better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBJ8ESFJBQS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8RBZC8#wasThisHelpful","RVBJ8ESFJBQS1","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've written many Amazon reviews, and it's quit rare for me to not recommend what I am writing about. Mostly because I do a lot of research before buying things, and I typically end up with exactly what I require. Not so with this HomeSpot Bluetooth Audio receiver.I've had no end of trouble with it on Apple devices. I've tried it with:* iPhone 5* iPhone 6* MacBook Pro 17"" (mid 2010)* MacBook Air 11"" (latest)In my experience, it's been a pain in the proverbial arse on all of these Apple devices. It refuses to connect with the MBP. It is fickle with connecting (and staying connected) with the iPhones. Each time I try to connect the iPhones, I typically I have delete the connection/pairing every time, and then repair them. That in itself can be tricky, but at least it tends to stay connected until I terminate the connection. But to then reconnect, again I'll have to remove the pairing completely from the iPhone, and start from scratch. The MacBook Air has better luck, but not 100% success.I also have a Nexus 4 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8. I have better success with these devices. It should be noted that both are running Cyanogenmod (non-stock android). They connect and play fairly decently. So, based on my experience, I'd say this device has decent compatibility with Android devices, and very questionable compatibility with Apple devices.If it was just on my Apple MacBookPro I experience these issues, I might be inclined to think it's the computer that's at fault. That's actually the only Apple device I own, and I was tending toward blaming the MacBookPro. But>> AlternativesI also have experience with the Brightech - BrightPlay Home HDTM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Receiver / Adapter with apt-X Technology for CD Quality Sound. I set a family member up with one. It has worked well with my MBP, and their iPad and iPhone 6. I would have bought the same one for myself, but since the HomeSpot was a little cheaper and had great reviews I figured I'd try it out. Also, I liked the idea of the device not having to be located right at a power point. The BrightPlay sits in the powerpoint (I suppose one could use an extension lead to reposition it), whilst the HomeSpot powers-up via a USB cable. This gives more flexibility as to where it is positioned.>> Conclusion...I would not buy it again, and would return it if I could (too late for that though). I am now looking for a better device, and also considering WiFi audio streaming instead (such as the Sabrent WiFi Audio Receiver). I see plenty of other people who are very happy with this device (which is why I ordered it), so there's a good chance your experience with it will be better than mine. If you buy it, I'd suggest giving it a thorough work-out in the first couple of weeks, on as many different devices and usage scenarios (such as distance from device) as you can. That way, if you're happy with it, great. But if not, you can make use of Amazon's excellent 30 return policy and send it back. Otherwise, I'd recommend the Brightech - BrightPlay Home HDTM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Receiver over this HomeSpot device.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9T84MM46387H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OBCAW2#wasThisHelpful","R9T84MM46387H","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own three pairs of Ecco shoes, all from the BIOM range.I've been an advocate of barefoot walking for many years, and have been mostly barefoot all my life. So I tend toward only wearing shoes with no arch support, and little or no raised heal padding. For instance, the other shoes I wear are Merrel Barefoot shoes.The Ecco Zero Cross-training shoes are very well made (as per most, if not all, Ecco shoes). They are lightweight, have have zero heel lift. The leather is Yak leather, and is well stitched.People who are accustomed to ""normal"" shoes will very likely NOT find these shoes to be comfortable for walking or standing for anything more than short lengths of time. This are as close to a minimalist shoe Ecco do, and that means almost no padding, arch support, heel lift, etc. I only recommend buying these shoes if you are into barefoot walking, and are looking for a little something to help protect your feet, with a shoe that also looks great.I hear from other reviews around the Internet that the one notable downside of Ecco shoes is the soles wear out much quicker than the rest of the shoe. I've not had mine long enough to comment on this, but it is a concern. I expect the uppers on these will easily last 5+ years of regular and near daily use, but I suspect the soles will wear out long before then if they are used outdoors (which one would expect to do).I know my size in the Ecco range (which I determined by visiting an Ecco shop), and it's been consistent across the three pairs I own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SH9IFKHP8GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XF1SYU#wasThisHelpful","R6SH9IFKHP8GK","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What follows is my review I posted on the 1lb jars of Nutrex Spirulina a few years ago, with a few extra comments regarding this bulk 5 lb option (which is the way I buy it).My so-called ""reviews"" are typically long. This is no exception. If that's not what you're after, I provide the IN BRIEF section at the top. If you have the time and inclination to browse over a lot more information about spirulina, please read the FULL REVIEW. If you find this review helpful, please click the button that says so. Thanks.<< IN BRIEF - THE CONDENSED REVIEW >>With this brand of Spirulina you are on to a good thing! Especially as far as taste and quality are concerned.Simply put, after 20+ years of Spirulina usage, this is the best Spirulina I know of, at one of the the best prices (and shipping options) I have seen anywhere online and off-line. If the best tasting Spirulina, made to high standards, is what you are looking for, this is the one to buy. In my opinion, it's best to pass on the slightly cheaper non-Hawaiian varieties (from India, China, etc.). There are a few other US made brands that are also good, but for reasons explored below, I stick with the Hawaiian variety.If you've never had spirulina, try this one first, as that taste is the easiest to handle. If you've had (non-Hawaiian) spirulina and didn't like the taste, try this one as it will likely taste better.Worried about Fukushima fall-out? Nutrex spirulina comes up clean. Only into RAW foods? Nutrex spirulina is dried at below 116F using a patented ""OceanChilled"" drying process. It's about as raw as you'll get unless you grow your own fresh spirulina. Looking for organic spirulina only? Nutrex was certified organic up until around 2008. Then the rules changed around the use of what's called Chilean Nitrate. So they dropped the certification, as Cyanotech believe other nitrogen sources are no ""cleaner"" or better than Chilean Nitrate. So, in my opinion, Nutrex is as good as certified organic, but if the certification matters to you, check out NOW Foods organic spirulina.That's my IN BRIEF review in a nutshell.I like to share detailed information where appropriate, so people like yourself can inform yourself if you so desire. For my more in-depth info, please read on:<< FULL REVIEW - THE FULL MONTY >>Let me first put this review into a helpful context.I have been eating Spirulina on an almost daily basis for approximately the past 20 years. Since my mid-teens I've been making big green looking smoothies every morning. My father and I affectionately refer to them as my ""Swamp Water"" or ""Swamp juice"" drinks.This particular Spirulina is from a fantastic high-tech Spirulina production facility on the coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. They use ultra pure deep ocean water for both growing and drying the Spirulina. It is dried at a low temperature to keep the nutrients in tact (at or below 116F / 46C).<< THE 5LB BULK OPTION >>It is worth noting that quite often the 1 lb jars actually work out cheaper, per pound, than the 5 lb bags (here on Amazon). The 1 lb jars often drop to around $23 to $25 each, which is around $115 to $125 for 5 lbs. The 5 lb bags are often selling on Amazon for around $140. Right now (Nov 4, 2014) I see 5 lb is only $118, which is the best I've seen in the last few years. So currently it's the best deal, but be sure to check as it might change by the time you read this.If you are having your order shipped internationally (via freight forwarding, or a friend, or simply in your luggage, since Amazon don't ship this item internationally) the 5 lb bag weighs a LOT less than 5x 1 lb jars, as the glass is heavy. So even if the 5 lb bag costs a little more than 5x 1lb jars, it may be worth it to cut back on weight.<< STORAGE - IMPORTANT >>If you buy the 5 lb bag, one concern for some people is whether they will use it quickly enough before it deteriorates. Here is what I suggest: Take a few weeks to a months worth out of the bag and store in an air-tight glass jar (use an old Nutrex spirulina jar, if you have one), and store the 5 lb bag in the fridge or freezer. Keep it well sealed. It will last a LONG time (many years) stored in the freezer. I recommend to NOT use the main bag (especially if you keep it in the fridge or freezer) on a daily basis. Aside from the fact the bag is hard to seal well, and the snap-lock seal will likely peel away from the bag if used often, it will also keep the spirulina dryer. Because refrigerated spirulina is much colder than the atmosphere in your house, each time you open the bag a little moisture will condensate onto the powder (this is especially true in humid [60% +] environments).<< THE TASTE FACTOR >>I'd been eating Spirulina for perhaps 5 years before I tried this Hawaiian variety (manufactured by Nutrex). Now, let me say I had always loved the taste of Spirulina. I'd put a couple of heaped tablespoons of it into my morning drink. Friends and family, however, found the taste too strong and ""green"" if I put in that much though.One day I met the guy who was importing Nutrex Hawaiian Spirulina into New Zealand (where I lived at the time). He asked if I'd like to try some (at a health Expo). I said, ""No thanks, I am very familiar with Spirulina"". He said, ""Not Hawaiian Spirulina. It tastes much nicer than the other kinds"". I let him know that I actually already enjoy the taste of Spirulina. At the time I was getting New Zealand branded Spirulina (imported from India or China). The guy said that compared to the Hawaiian variety, other Spirulina tastes like earth. I'd never noticed that. Curious, I tried his little cup of green stuff, and WOW it was extra delicious. I realised, for the first time, that indeed the other varieties tasted a bit like soil. Whereas the Hawaiian variety tastes creamy and... well, it's hard to describe. Let's just say it is delicious for those people into concentrated green foods, and whilst perhaps calling it ""delicious"" is going too far for some, it is certainly the most palatable for those folk who are not yet used to eating concentrated green foods.So, that was over 15 years ago, and I've eaten primarily Hawaiian Spirulina ever since. Partly because it tastes great, which means I can put as much as I want into my drink without it getting over-powering, but also because my research indicated that the Hawaiian variety is superior in quality and nutritional content. This particular one being sold here on Amazon is at one of the best prices I have seen, which is why I often buy it from here when I am in the USA.<< SPIRULINA BENEFITS >>Rather than me listing here all the many benefits of spirulina, I suggest doing some research online. There's no point in me repeating already widely available info. What I will say is that I am not without reason for using spirulina pretty much every day for over 20 years. For me, I consider it a staple food. I have excellent health, and I attribute some of that to regular use of spirulina. If I couldn't buy it any more (for whatever reason), I'd get into growing it fresh myself (in fact I am investigating that option anyway).If you are new to Spirulina and super-foods in general, I suggest adding this product to a smoothie, and drinking that each day. Use clean spring water if you can. Certainly avoid chlorinated and fluoridated tap water if at all possible. In a blender add to the water 1 ripe organic banana as a base. It will greatly improve the taste.Then add the following:- Start out with 1 teaspoon of Spirulina. Increase to 2 or so tablespoons if you wish, and as you get accustomed to the taste.- A handful of Raw Organic Goji Berries (soak them in water overnight if you want them to blend more smoothly),- 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of Organic Raw Maca Powder- 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of Lucuma Powder- 1 tablesppon of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms - Fresh Bee Pollen Whole Granules (or any other decent pollen on Amazon, as there are quite a few now)- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of organic Ginger Root Powder (that'll help with your digestion of the other goodies).- You could also add 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of Chlorella powder. The one from NOW foods is a good deal.This approximate recipe is for about a quart (1 litre) of drink so use 1 quart (1 L) of water.Blend them up in a blender, and enjoy.I have given workshops on what I call ""Intelligent Nutritional"" throughout Europe and Canada, and this is a basic version of a recipe I share with people. I've had many people after just 3 to 7 days tell me they feel like a new person (they look like it too!!) after drinking this each morning. Friends comment on how them seem to be ""glowing"" and ask what they are up to!! Try it out.<< TABLETS OR POWDER ? >>I recommend using spirulina as a powder, if possible. I think it's best to taste and ""chew"" (keep in the mouth for a little time) what we are eating.  Swallowing tablets by-passes that step. If you really can't stomach the taste of Spirulina at all (and I know some people can't), you'll have to go with the tablets. Power is also more instantly digestible, although that's unlikely to make any real difference. If you decide to buy tablets from another company, make sure they are 100% low pressure/low-heat pressed tablets. Some brands have fillers and binders in their tablets which indicate a poor quality product and high-pressure tableting machines (which will damage the spirulina). Nutrex tablets are good quality.If you know little or nothing about Spirulina, please read up on it on the Internet - it's worth leaning about. I'll mention here that it is a highly concentrated source of a very broad range of nutrients. I'd say a couple of tablespoons of this rich green powder contains more nutrition that the people eating the Standard American Diet (SAD) might get in a week worth of meals. This is powerful stuff that will change the way you feel, big time! Enjoy! I know many people who have had a wide range of very positive benefits from adding spirulina to their diet. Less food cravings, diminished desire for junk food, more energy, improved sex-life, less need for coffee in the morning, weight loss, improved memory, and many other benefits are just some of what people have reported to me and in literature.<< ORGANIC STATUS >>If you want ORGANIC spirulina, the Nutrex brand is NOT certified (or un-certified) organic. HOWEVER my research into spirulina indicates it is not possible to grow certified organic spirulina with reputable certification authorities (such as the major ones in the ""Western World"". Since October 2005, most of ` Organic Spirulina ' was from USA. Two major USA companies (Cyanotech, the makers of Nutrex brand, being one of them) have both ceased production of `Organic Spirulina', due to the USDA terminating the use of a fertiliser which was originally permitted as an organic feed for the growth of Spirulina. When those rules changed, the organic status was dropped. It is my understanding the only so-called ""organic spirulina"" is from China and India, and that one reason for this is that the so-called ""organic"" standards there are questionable (i.e. not worth paying extra money on). The best organic spirulina, according to my research, is made by Parry Nutraceuticals, and marketed by third parties under many different brands.For the past 18 years I have been eating almost more-or-less only organically produced foods. Yet in the case of the Nutrex spirulina it does not bother me that it lost its organic certification status due to changes in the organic standards. Having researched the matter, I have no problems with that technicality in this particular case.I have asked NOW Foods about their ORGANIC SPIRULINA POWDER and their non-organic spirulina (that was previously from Hawaii). The organic product is certified organic (by a number of reputable certifying groups) and grown/produced in India. They tell me it is very high quality and from a state-of-the-art facility there in India. I am aware it is manufactured by Parry Nutraceuticals. You can look them up online. I have a tub of it sitting in my kitchen draw. It's been there since mid-2012, hardly touched. The reason is that it tastes awful. It literally smells and tastes like cow or horse manure. I've bought a wide range of spirulina brands around the world, and the Organic NOW Foods Spirulina takes the award for the worst tasting, by a long shot. It's the first time I've found Spirulina to be unpalatable. I understand from Parry literature (online) their product is high quality, and has a long list of organic certifications. But in this instance taste wins out over my wish to eat organic foods. I have communicated with NOW Foods numerous times in the last year about this issue. They say they are aware of it and are that the manufacturer is working on it. You can read my full review of the NOW Foods Spirulina for more details of those emails.<< OTHER BRANDS (of Hawaiian Spirulina) >>It should be noted that ALL of the above info I have been posting applies not only to the product this review is on. It applies to all Hawaiian spirulina, under any brand, as it is all manufactured by Cyanotech, the owners of the Nutrex brand. Other brands that are stated to be Hawaiian are: MicrOrganics (UK), TruNature (from Costco), Nature's Life Hawaiian Spirulina, Lifetime Hawaiian Spirulina, Thompson Nutritional Products. Obviously the prices go up and down, but in general this Nutrex product I am reviewing is the best price.[[ UPDATE on the above statement: Since late 2011 Cyanotech ceased selling their Hawaiian Spirulina in bulk to US based companies, who then resell it under their own brands. This means that there are no US brands with Hawaiian spirulina except Nutrex. If they still claim to be selling Hawaiian spirulina, it is highly questionable. Only non-US companies continue to bulk buy from Cyanotech and package this spirulina under their own brands (mostly in the UK). There are brands selling spirulina grown in California, and perhaps some other US sources I am not aware of (see below).<< OTHER USA GROWN OPTIONS ? >>Apart from the various brands listed above which are Hawaiian, the other USA grown spirulina (from California, not Hawaii) is the Earthrise Spirulina Natural brand. I have bought it a few times over the years (although not in the last 5 years or so) and I don't recall having any personal issues with it. I see most people report it tastes acceptable or nice. I know some people have switched form Nutrex to Earthrise because of concerns about radioactivity from Fukushima. I think it's pretty hard to say what the exact impact of that ongoing (yes, it's still critical, as of Feb 2013) disaster. Most, if not all, of the US West coast received fallout from Fukushima, so the Earthrise facilities in California might have been just as likely to be affected as Hawaii. Anyway, that's another option if you want a US made product (as opposed to spirulina from China, India, or Thailand - the other main producers), that is also is quality packaging (brown glass jar). Right now on Amazon, Earthrise Spirulina Natural is $30.99 plus $5 shipping (shipped by Swanson Health Products).<< BETTER PRICE OPTIONS ? >>As mentioned in my UPDATE above, there is no companies in the United States selling Hawaiian spirulina except Cyanotech who have the Nutrex brand. There if Hawaiian spirulina is what you want, this is it. The best option, and the best price.PACKAGING NOTE: Spirulina is sensitive to oxidation from light and air. The dark brown glass jar of the Nutrex brand (and Earthrise brand) is superior to the thin white HDPE plastic used by many companies bottling spirulina.<< NOW FOODS SPIRULINA (the non-organic one) >>For a nearly two years I was recommending in this review that people buy the bulk 4 lb tub of (non-organic) Hawaiian Spirulina from NOW FOODS. That's because it came from the same grower in Hawaii (Cyanotech) as the Nutrex brand. At that time the 4 lb tub was by far the best price for Hawaiian Spirulina. As of late 2011 I dropped that recommendation, because NOW FOODS changed their non-organic supplier to Parry Nutraceuticals (the same company they get their Organic product from). I have not tried it, but from what I am reading online it tastes as awful as the organic one from Parry (many people have also mentioned the manure smell and taste). If it tastes anything like their Organic Spirulina from India, it will not be at all pleasant. So since late 2011 I've been again recommending the Nutrex brand as the best spirulina at the best price. There are a few other companies selling the Hawaiian variety, but their prices are higher and their packaging cheaper (plastic as opposed to dark brown air-tight glass bottles).<< COMMUNICATIONS WITH CYANOTECH ON ORGANIC STATUS>>(12/Mar/2012) I have received numerous communications from Cyanotech in response to my questions to them. I'll pass on the following information for your consideration:I communicated with Cyanotech some time ago now... and they assure me their spirulina is ""herbicide, pesticide, and GMO free"". They did not mention fertilisers, so I will enquire further on that.They have stated:(Quote) >> ""Plant-based organic (biological) agriculture is fundamentally a system of maintaining soil health and therefore plant vitality. Organic farming relies heavily on the use of nitrogen fixing cover crops, composted manures, crop rotation, and of course organic farming eschews the use of synthetic pesticides (including herbicides). Properly managed organic growing systems build a healthy topsoil with a minimum of soil loss, and also minimized losses of nutrients to ground water, streams, and lakes.The line between organic and standard cultivation of Spirulina is much less distinct, as pesticides and herbicides are not used in the culture of Spirulina. Furthermore, since Spirulina is grown without soil, there is no crop rotation or direct additions of manure to the growing system. Instead, Spirulina growers create the exact conditions of nature (high baking soda and ample amounts of soluble phosphorous and nitrogen) . Manures do not work in this system as they would be harvested with the algae and would contaminate it. This is because Spirulina is a filamentous algae and must be screened out of the water using a very fine mesh.In many ways, however, Spirulina culture belongs with more traditional biological growing systems. Spirulina does not create any ground water pollution or soil erosion (it is grown in lined ponds). Water and energy use are much enhanced over those of terrestrial agriculture (including organic systems). And as I mentioned, there are no pesticides or herbicides used. Spirulina culture is also extremely energy efficient. And although traditional organic farming can use cover crops for nitrogen, there are also phosphorous inputs that are from outside sources (this is absolutely necessary also with Spirulina). Simply put, both organic terrestrial and Spirulina culture systems are reduced input farming techniques that are much lower impact in terms of pollution and soil loss than typical commercial farming."">> (End quote)Their literature also states the following about their Spirulina:>> ""Pesticide free, Herbicide free, Environmentally friendly, Full nutritional value, Purified nutrients, Highest growth rate, Low heavy metal level, Low bacterial count""There is still no mention of where they source the nutrients for spirulina production. I'll asked about this in March 2012, with no reply. (Feb 2013, I have asked again, and will post their answer when I get it).Nutrex also share the following explanation about why they dropped the organic certification:>> ""In October 2002 the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) voted to continue to allow the use of mined Chilean nitrate in Spirulina production until October 2005.  (Chilean nitrate is a water soluble form of nitrogen used in the production of Organic Spirulina.)  Unfortunately, the USDA organic production regulations are directed at terrestrial farming and do not address the unique position occupied by aquatic farming of crops such as Spirulina.  Production of Spirulina requires water soluble forms of phosphorus and nitrogen.  This is not desired in terrestrial farming as soluble forms of phosphorous and nitrogen can harm the soil and contaminate ground water; on the other hand, in Spirulina production this is not a problem because all culture ponds are lined and there is no runoff or contamination of ground water.  Cyanotech feels that the NOSB will vote to disallow the use of Chilean nitrate in October 2005 as it is mined and thus not considered a sustainable source of nitrogen.With Chilean nitrate prohibited in all organic production systems, an alternative source of organic soluble nitrogen must be found.  The only sources of soluble nitrogen allowed under organic regulations are compost teas and various manures.  Cyanotech has examined these potential sources of soluble nitrogen and found them unsatisfactory because they would:1) Contaminate our Spirulina with lead and other heavy metals2) Increase the bacterial count in Spirulina3) Produce inferior Spirulina products at a much higher costFor these reasons, Cyanotech will stop production of organic Spirulina if Chilean nitrate is disallowed in October, 2005.  Instead we will concentrate our efforts to continually improve the quality of our All Natural Spirulina products.In many ways standard Spirulina culture methods (not organic) are compatible with traditional organic growing systems. Spirulina does not create any ground water pollution or soil erosion since it is grown in lined ponds.  Water and energy are used much more efficiently than in terrestrial agriculture use (including organic systems).  Cyanotech's All Natural Spirulina products are GMO free, are produced without the use of pesticides or herbicides, are produced using pure deep seawater pumped from a depth of 2000 ft as a source of trace minerals and use a patented OceanChill(tm) drying process to preserve oxygen sensitive nutrients.  Hawaiian Spirulina from Cyanotech has the highest purity, and by far the highest nutritional value of any Spirulina available.>> (End quote)I will post back here when I find out more about their fertilisation methods. For now it seems they use what is called ""Chilean nitrate,"" which was until 2005 an excepted fertiliser under US organic standards.<< FUKUSHIMA RADIOACTIVITY CONCERNS >>(Added 13/03/2012) Fukushima radioactivity impact report: Nutrex/Cyanotech assure me (and the public) they have not experienced any fallout or related effects from the Fukushima nuclear power plant incident in Japan. They have made this public statement:>>"" Cyanotech implemented monitoring of our Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica and BioAstin Natural Astaxanthin products immediately after the disaster in Japan through independent third party laboratory analysis. The analyses found no detectable radiation (less than 1.0 Bq/kg for iodine-131; less than 0.5 Bq/kg for cesium-134; and less than 0.6 Bq/kg for cesium-137), in products produced on 3/22/2011, which was the time in which it was theorized that the tail of the radiation plume from Japan could reach Hawaii. Cyanotech continues to test its products for radiation contamination through independent third party laboratory analysis to ensure that they are the highest quality, most healthful products available in the supplement industry. Recent radiation testing of Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica and BioAstin products find no detectable radiation."" << (End Quote)For those people concerned about radioactivity in general, please note that Spirulina has been proven to significantly reduce the ill effects of radiation exposure. If you want to maximise that effect look into using Astaxanthin, which is extracted from Spirulina. It is the primary antioxidant in Spirulina, and is considered to be the most potent anti-oxidant we know of. There are many options for this on Amazon so I recommend doing a search to see them all.<< MY CONCLUSIONS >>Nutrex Hawaiian Spirulina is a great product and I am sure you'll be as or more happy with it that the other spirulina options. Ideally go for the powder, but if you can't stomach it, switch to tablets. If you want certified organic you'll have to go with a potentially fowl tasting variety from India. If you simply want US made, use either Hawaiian (Nutrex or one of the other brands I listed) or Earthrise (from CA). This bulk 5 lb option is often the most cost effective way to buy Hawaiian spirulina, but the price can vary a lot, so I suggest comparing the per pound price to the 1lb jars before you purchase.I wish you all the best of health,Jonathan EvattInternational lecturer, Traditional Naturopath, and award-winning author of Peace, Power, and Presence: Wisdom for a Lift of Freedom.>> If you find this review helpful, please click the Helpful button.

"Young Living Essential Oils make decent oils. No complaints there.The are, however, all basically over-priced... in my opinion. That's pretty much always the case with Multi-level marketing companies (which YL is).In this particular case, however, there are some additional complications that may be confusion for people in terms of the price. I know it had me confused for a bit, until I spent a good half hour researching it. Therefore I wish to point a few things out, and share what I discovered:Whoever is selling this 5ml of Valor blend on Amazon is charging a relatively high price (as many other ""reviewers"" have pointed out). But not necessarily higher than it would otherwise be (say if you bought this directly from a YL distributor).The primary VALOR product available in the USA is actually a 15 ml blend WITH a carrier oil. The recommended retail price from a YLEO for a 15 ml bottle of Valor is CA$33 (in Canada) and around US$28.62 in the USA. But these all have a relatively inexpensive carrier oil. So we can't compare this 5ml product with the 15ml products.HOWEVER: I notice there are different product images showing for this 5ml product on Amazon. The one on the product page indicates it is 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil, which will mean it is without the (relatively inexpensive) base oil. This is the reason for the higher price, when comparing the 5ml with the 15ml Valor. I have not been able to find any YL Internet literature showing this 5ml Valor as a 100% pure oil, except when sold as part of a kit (with a selection of other oils). Otherwise, all one can buy is the 15ml version, which, as mentioned, contains a base oil. The image that shows up as I write this review (on the review writing page) shows a different label, and it does not state 100% Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil on the visible part of the label... to that adds further ambiguity. Despite this, I am going to assume this is the 100% essential oil being sold here.<< WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS >>From my perspective, if someone wants Young Living oils they are best to buy them from an official distributor.Hopefully you can find a distributor that is not going to push you into joining and getting a distributor kit, etc., if all you want is the oils. Good luck.BUT in all honesty, my professional opinion is that YL oils are (like EVERY other MLM product I've seen in the past 30+ years) significantly over priced. You can make up the Valor blend yourself... save money, and likely learn a few things and have some fun along the way.The Valor blend is made up of the following oils:- Spruce (Picea mariana)- Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora)- Blue Tansy (Tanacetum annuum)- Frankincense (Boswellia carteri)- In a base of almond oil (also listed as ""in a base of coconut oil"")So, as mentioned, this does not classify as a pure essential oil. It is a blend in a base (or ""carrier"") oil. There's no telling just how much base oil is in there, but it makes a huge difference to the value of the product. I think it is safe to say this is mostly base oil. Hence the price difference between the 5ml Pure oil and the 15 ml ""massage"" blend.<< MAKING YOUR OWN >>If you have an interest in getting more hands-on with your essential oils, I suggest making your own blends. You'll save money, and no doubt learn a few things and enjoy the experience. if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, by all means buy this oil blend directly from a YL distributor.There are numerous options on Amazon for what looks like good quality alternatives for each of these ingredients, except the Blue tansy:To make it easy I have created a list using Amazon Listmania: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R2J7OIKKRPTPOB/The Blue tansy, as far as I can tell, is currently (Oct 15, 2014) best bought directly from Plant Therapy or Eden's Garden.I suggest keeping it simple, and using equal amounts of each oil. That way if you buy 10 ml bottles of each, you'll end up with 40 ml of 100% pure therapeutic grade Valor blend.I'd suggest adding around 10 to 20 drops of that to 30 ml of carrier oil, or less if you prefer.<< RATING >>I have giving this what I consider to be a ""neutral"" rating. Three stars. Not bad per se, but not something I recommend, for the above-mentioned reasons.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CH11HIHGSHYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7W66B2#wasThisHelpful","R2CH11HIHGSHYI","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not familiar with the Gramicci brand until buying this item, along with a number of others. I was looking for clothing made from hemp and/or organic cotton.This Gramicci Men's Organic McKay Performance Crew is made from 53% Hemp/44% Certified Organic Cotton. The remaining 3% is spandex, which gives it a nice stretch quality to it.This garment is excellently constructed. The seems are very well stitched, and they are flattened to reduce any rubbing for those who are highly active. The seam layout includes a panel up each side, which is nice. It distinguishes the shirt from cheaper T's.Looking at the picture here on Amazon I was not convinced I would like the Oasis Green color. Now that I have the garment, I see it’s a slightly deeper green than the picture indicates, which is great. It looks also a tad neon in the photo, which had me concerned.Gramicci does not indicate what kind of dyes they use. That might be my only complaint. I am sure many of the people going for hemp and organic cotton garments would quite likely appreciate knowing if non-toxic / natural dyes have been used. They don't say, so I can only assume the dyes are nothing out of the ordinary.I highly recommend this garment to anyone who appreciates well made clothing and highly quality ecologically sound fabrics. Hemp is tough, and I expect this garment will last me many many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMY5RQGVTGRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COJHJMM#wasThisHelpful","R1IMY5RQGVTGRY","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this spirulina product and discovered Stakich claimed it was from Kona, Hawaii, I was rather excited due to the relatively low pricing, and that it's in plastic jars (much cheaper for shipping to New Zealand)HOWEVER... Extensive research leads me to surmise Stakich are hiding something; that they are not being honest in their representation of this product. In the following ""review"" I will share what I have discovered, and leave you to form your own opinion.~ Introduction ~I've been using spirulina pretty much daily since the early 1990's (around 24 years). It's a staple food for me, and I eat 2 to 4 tablespoons of it a day (more or less). For the past 22 years I have been using primarily Nutrex Spirulina, although I continue to research and try other brands (many have come up over the years). You may have already seen my very popular review of Nutrex Spirulina powder.Until a couple of years ago, Cyanotech (producers of the Nutrex brand) sold spirulina pacifica under their own brand and they also sold it in bulk to third party private label companies. At one point I was recommending people buy Hawaiin spirulina from Now Foods, as it was the Cyanotech product, but selling at a cheaper price. I had a popular review on Now Foods spirulina too, although I had to change it when they started sourcing from India and the new product tasted foul.~ Unanswered questions for Stakich Inc~Stakich are claiming their spirulina powder is from Kona, on the Big Island of Hawaii. They don't actively promote this though, which strikes me as odd. Hawaiian spirulina is renowned for being some of the best in the world, and anyone selling genuine Hawaiian spirulina are ordinarily proud of the fact, and they go to great lengths to capitalise on this fact, by actively promoting it. On their spirulina product page it does say ""Ingredients: 100% Pure Hawaiian Spirulina"", but nothing about how it is manufactured, and nothing on the label indicates it is from Hawaii. When asking them directly, I was told (by Marcus) ""It is sourced from Hawaii"" by email, and ""Kona, Hawaii"" by voicemail and during a phone conversation. I see other customers have posted in the Questions and Answers for this product here on Amazon that they were also told it was made in Kona Coast, Hawaii.Cyanotech is the only spirulina producer in Hawaii, and they are based in Kona. Kona coast is not a big area so it would have to be a very small and secretive operation for someone else to be growing spirulina there, and for Cyantotech to not know about it. I've been there, it's an amazing place. As of 2014 I understand there is one other company in the process of setting up in Hawaii for algae production, but this is purely for the production of Astaxanthin (a powerful antioxidant extracted from algae, including from spirulina).When I asked Macrus (at Stakich) which particular company makes their spirulina, he was evasive and simply said, ""We don't give out that information... it's a private producer"". I asked if he would email me more information on their drying process, a Certificate of Analysis, and a list of the inputs his producers uses in the spirulina growing process (spirulina needs a lot of nitrogen, which can be derived from any number of sources, some better than others). He agreed, and yet has failed to send me this information. I also asked for this information some months ago, and he agreed and then failed to send it. I also spent many hours online searching for everything related to Hawaii and Spirulina. I found no other spirulina producers in Hawaii, except the one mentioned above (who are going to produce Astaxanthin from algae).I have tried to obtain this information from Stakich since June 2014, and it is now early September.Cyanotech have confirmed in writing they are the only spirulina producer in Hawaii, according to their extensive knowledge. They have confirmed that none of their staff in the Nutrex or Cyanotech departments have ever heard of the company ""Stakich Inc"". They have confirmed they do not sell spirulina to any US-based companies (since around 2012). They are not aware of any of their non-US bulk buyers on-selling it to US companies, and they commented this would make the price very high.~ CONCLUSION ~Until Stakich come through with the information I have requested, it think it is reasonable to surmise they are lying about the origin of their spirulina. I was very hopeful it did in fact come from Hawaii, but presently have no reason whatsoever to believe it does.I tried to find out where they are in fact getting their spirulina from by looking into US Customs Import records. I could see they bring in bee pollen, and other bee related products from China. I found one record of spirulina being imported by them, from China, in 2009. But that's old news. So it's possible they are sourcing it somewhere in the USA (not Hawaii, however), or that it comes from China or India (the two biggest producers) and I couldn't find the import records.~ My recommendation ~I highly recommend people add spirulina to their diet.My preferred brand is Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 16-Ounce Bottle. I but it in 5 lb foil bags (Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 5-pound Bag), although the glass jars are actually often cheaper per lb here on Amazon.com (I get it sent to New Zealand, so the shipping is a lot less for me on a 5lb bag than on 5x 1lb glass jars).If you want strictly organic spirulina, the only producer I know of is Parry Pharmaceuticals in India. The organic Now Foods (Now Foods, ORGANIC SPIRULINA POWDER, 1LB) spirulina is from Parry. I tried it and, as you'll see in my review of it, the taste was horrid (tasted like cow dung). Another US grown option is Earthrise Spirulina (grown in California) (Earthrise Spirulina Natural Powder -- 16 oz). I've had that a few times (some years ago), and I don't recall having any issues with it. The taste was agreeable, from what I recall.~ Star Rating ~It is very rare for me to review a product I have not tried. I apologise for doing so, but in this instance after 3 months of trying to get more info from Stakich on their product, I refuse to buy their spirulina. I am providing this information so other potential spirulina lovers like me can make an informed decision when it comes to their options, and benefit from my extensive research.I give this product 2 stars, purely on the merit of spirulina itself. I am sure spirulina would do most people a great deal of good no matter what reputable source it comes from. That very likely includes Stakich spirulina. BUT if it's important for you to know where it has in fact come from, Stakich spirulina is not one I recommend... as they are keeping it an elusive mystery.Good luck... and good health.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUBX06QQ706F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LR2CTS#wasThisHelpful","RCUBX06QQ706F","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I asked if he would email me more information on their drying process, a Certificate of Analysis of the product, and a list of the inputs his private producer uses in the growing process (spirulina needs a lot of nitrogen, which can be derived from any number of sources, some better than others). He agreed, and yet has failed to send me this information. I also asked for this information some months ago, and he agreed and then failed to send it. I also spent many hours online searching for everything related to Hawaii and Spirulina. I found no other spirulina producers in Hawaii, except the one mentioned above (who are planning to produce Astaxanthin from algae).I have tried to obtain this information from Stakich since June 2014, and it is now early September.Cyanotech have confirmed in writing they are the only spirulina producer in Hawaii, according to their extensive knowledge. They have confirmed that none of their staff in the Nutrex or Cyanotech departments have ever heard of the company ""Stakich Inc"". They have confirmed they do not sell spirulina to any US-based companies (since late 2012). They are not aware of any of their non-US bulk buyers on-selling it to US companies, and they commented this would make the price prohibitively high.~ CONCLUSION ~Until Stakich come through with the information I have requested, it think it is reasonable to conclude they are lying about the origin of their spirulina. I was very hopeful it did in fact come from Hawaii, but presently I have no reason whatsoever to believe it does.I tried to find out where they are in fact getting their spirulina from by looking into US Customs Import records. I could see they bring in bee pollen, and other bee related products from China. I found one record of spirulina being imported by them, from China, in 2009. But that's old news. So it's possible they are sourcing it somewhere in the USA (not Hawaii, however), or that it comes from China or India (the two biggest producers) and I simply couldn't find the import records.~ My recommendation ~I highly recommend people add spirulina to their diet.My preferred brand is Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 16-Ounce Bottle. I buy it in 5 lb foil bags (Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 5-pound Bag), although the glass jars are actually often cheaper per lb here on Amazon.com (I get it sent to New Zealand, so the shipping is a lot less for me on a 5lb bag than on 5x 1lb glass jars).If you want strictly organic spirulina, the only producer I know of is Parry Pharmaceuticals in India. The organic Now Foods (Now Foods, ORGANIC SPIRULINA POWDER, 1LB) spirulina is from Parry. I tried it and, as you'll see in my review of it, the taste was horrid (tasted like cow dung). Another US grown option is Earthrise Spirulina (grown in California) (Earthrise Spirulina Natural Powder -- 16 oz). I've had that a few times (some years ago), and I don't recall having any issues with it. The taste was agreeable, from what I recall.[UPDATE: Oct 2014: There is now another organic spirulina readily available on Amazon. It's from Earth Circle Earth Circle Organics Raw Organic Spirulina Powder, 8 oz. I've been trying an increasing number of their products in recent months. I have recently tried their spirulina, and whilst I had no particular issues with it (i.e. it didn't taste and small like horse manure, like the Now Foods Organic Spirulina did when I tried it in 2012 or 13) I am hesitant to eat concentrated food products like spirulina when produced in China. I understand they run their own tests in the US, but I still prefer the tried and proven Nutrex Hawaiian myself. But if you want ""organic"" and don't mind the ""China"" element, Earth Circle it's worth checking out.]~ Star Rating ~It is very rare for me to review a product I have not tried. I apologise for doing so, but in this instance after 3 months of trying to get more info from Stakich on their product, I refuse to buy their spirulina. I am providing this information so other potential spirulina lovers like me can make an informed decision when it comes to their options, and benefit from my extensive research.I give this product 2 stars, purely on the merit of spirulina itself. I am sure spirulina would do most people a great deal of good no matter what reputable source it comes from. That very likely includes Stakich spirulina. BUT if it's important for you to know where it has in fact come from, Stakich spirulina is not one I recommend... as they are keeping it an elusive mystery. I personally consider it important to know the source because Spirulina is easily damaged during the drying process; it is easily contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins; and different species of spirulina have a different nutritional profile. Some are better than others.Good luck... and good health.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOHAGUZULPGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LR2CSY#wasThisHelpful","R3BOHAGUZULPGJ","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I write long and informative reviews. If that's not to your liking, or you don't have time for a long review, please read the ""IN BRIEF"" summary at the beginning. If you want more information, read the full review.>> IN BRIEF - THE SHORT & SWEET VERSION <<I've been using Sprite Shower filters for nearly 20 years (since around 1998) and have no issues with them. I avoid showering in chlorinated water without one of these installed. I take mine all over the world for this reason (I am an avid traveller).I find this product works well. No complaints. What's more, my brother who has eczema finds his skin is 100% better when he uses these filters (I loaned him one and he wouldn't give it back!). His skin clears up when he uses this filter. I notice my hair is (which is long) is somehow nicer when I don't use chlorinated water (i.e. rain water, spring water, or water filtered by a Sprite).I highly recommend this product, and have put many friends and family onto using it. They all love showering with it, and notice better hair and skin condition.If you have a hand held shower head (the kind that's on the end of a metallic hose) it is usually fine to install the filter part of this Sprite product where the handle screws onto the hose. The 3 Setting Shower Head won't be needed. Full details in my longer review below.Below is my full review which will interest you if you wish to learn more about these filters, and related issues with shower water, their usage, fitting them, etc.> >NEWER MODEL:There is a newer model of this filter. It’s the only one listed on the Sprite web site for a few years now (2015). I see some people complaining the housing on the new model cracked. It sounds like it's a design fault. The housing is not as robust. I’ve got a few units of the older model, and have dropped them occasionally, and they are very strong. The newer model is currently this one: Sprite HO2-WH-M Universal Shower Filter - NEW MODEL. It’s possible this older model to which this review is attached, actually ships the newer design. Although I am not sure. I am attempting to find out.< <>> MY FULL REVIEW AND DETAILED INFORMATION & TIPS <<--THE CHLORINE ISSUE--Chlorine is a known carcinogen. A little research on Google and PubMed makes that obvious. It's also an irritant. If you're checking out this product, you likely already know chlorine is an issue. So I won't get into details here.It's worth noting it's estimated that about 80% of the chlorine the average person takes in from water is via showing (through the skin, but also through inhalation). So, if you're avoiding chlorine in your drinking water for health reasons you'll like want to use a decent shower filter.I've been using Sprint shower filters since around 1998 (not the same one!! They last a long time, but not that long!! I wish), and they are excellent.I am very sensitive to chlorine. My whole life I can't drink chlorinated water. And I refuse to shower in cities with highly chlorinated water (like Auckland, and New York, L.A., etc.) because the bathroom quickly smells like a gas chamber.This filter does not remove the chlorine, as a drinking water filter does. Rather it binds the chlorine at an ionic level (converting it into a safe chloride salt) and effectively neutralising it.-- ABOUT KDF & CHLORGON FILTER MEDIA-- (pasted from a website about KDF)Kinetic Degradation Fluxion (KDF) is a high-purity copper-zinc formulation that uses a basic chemical process known as redox (oxidation/reduction) to remove chlorine, lead, mercury, iron, and hydrogen sulfide from water supplies. The process also has a mild anti-bacterial, algaecitic, and fungicitic, effect and may reduce the accumulation of lime scale. The KDF redox process works by exchanging electrons with contaminants. This ""give and take"" of electrons converts many contaminants into harmless components. During this reaction, electrons are transferred between molecules, and new compounds are created. Some harmful contaminants are changed into harmless components. Free chlorine, for instance, is changed into benign, water-soluble chloride salt, which is then carried harmlessly through the water supply. Many heavy metals such as copper, lead, mercury and others, react and bond with the KDF medium's surface, thus being effectively removed from the water supply.KDF process media will reduce or remove chlorine, iron, hydrogen sulfide, lead, mercury, magnesium, and chromium, and may inhibit the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi. Redox media remove up to 98% of water-soluble cations (positively-charged ions) of lead, mercury, copper, nickel, chromium, and other dissolved metals. While removal rates depend on a number of factors, more than 98% of chlorine is removed by KDF in home water treatment systems (90% in shower water filters due to high flow rate).With Sprite filters a substance called Chlorgon is also included in the KDF media, to increase the temperature range for effective chlorine removal.-- THE BENEFITS I NOTICE --This shower filter from Sprite Industries makes a very noticeable difference to the levels of chlorine (and related toxic gases, such as chloroform) in the bathroom atmosphere. I got my first one 12 years ago when I moved to a town in New Zealand that was having issues with farm animal run-off getting into their water supply. They temporary solution was to greatly increase the level of chlorine treatment in the water. The water smelt so strong just washing my hands was a complete turn-off. I installed one of these filters and the problem was solved. No more toxic chlorine smell when showering.I travel a lot and I take one of these filters with me every where. I install it where ever I go and need use a shower. It is usually very easy to remove the existing shower-head by hand, and screw this one on. I don't find that plumbing tape is necessary.My hair is nicer when I use filter water, and needs washing less often.My skin does not get dry when I use filtered water. Otherwise I tend to get dryness on my shins, elbows, knees, and face. I don't experience this when using this filter for my showers.My brother has very sensitive skin. He tends to get eczema. His skin easily gets red, thin, broken, and itchy. This problems essentially went away after I gave him one of these shower filters. He couldn't believe he had suffered so much for so many years, and the answer was so cheap and simple. He knows when the filter needs replacing because his skin will start getting irritated from showering. He replaces the cartridge every 18 to 24 months (with three adults using the shower daily).-- HELPFUL TIPS and TRICKS --Many modern showers have a hose that goes from the wall to a shower head sitting in an adjustable bracket. (like Handheld Shower, for example)The idea is that you can lift it off the bracket by hand and shower that way. Usually where the hose screws into the fitting on the wall is too close to the wall for a Sprite  filter to screw in. What you can do is screw the hand piece off of the other end of the hose and put the filter on between the hose end and the hand-piece. Due to the way the threads go, the filter will be around the opposite way from usual, which is fine as the filter is bi-directional.NEW TIP (August 2015): If you are using the filter on a shower system like the one just described, you may find the filter makes the shower head and handle too heavy. This can cause it to droop down. It also makes it rather heavy to hold when actually using it as a hand-shower. To avoid this issue you may benefit from buying a short length (12in of less) of flexible 1/2 inch female-to-female hosing, such as this: LASCO 10-0413 1/2-Inch Female Iron Pipe by1/2-Inch Female Iron Pipe by 12-Inch Flex Stainless Steel Braided with Poly Inner Core Water SupplyAttach that small hose to where the shower hose attaches to the threaded fitting on the wall. Then attach the filter. Then attach the shower hose to the filter. What you'll now have is the filter at (or 12 inches from) the wall end of your shower hose. Droopy heavy shower-head issue solved.- - ->> Filling the bath (great for children)Connecting the Sprite filter on your shower hose also comes in handy if the shower is above a bath tub and you wish to have a chlorine-free bath. You can install the filter as described above, but just leave off the shower head (or take it off) when you want to fill the bath. The shower hose can dangle down into the bath and fill it. Children have sensitive skin, and I highly recommend filling their bath this way.>> Travel Tip: Showering on the roadIf you are going to take this filter with you travelling I recommend taking a small adjustable spanner/wrench or vice-grip with you. I've sometimes come across shower heads that I can not remove with my bare hands. Trying to find a wrench in the moment can be next to impossible, or at least a nuisance. One like this one should do the trick: Vice Grip 4WR 4-Inch Curved Jaw Locking Pliers with Wire Cutter or Crescent Adjustable Wrench 4 Inch (I am assuming that'll open wide enough. I personally use a Vice-grip as it well even if the shower fitting nut has a rounded style to it.-- ALTERNATIVE FILTER OPTIONS --I've been so happy with the performance of the Sprite filters, that I've never had the inclination to try any other brand or type. I have researched all the major kinds out there, and none convinced me to change. The Sprite was the most cost effective, and gets rated as having excellent results.In recent months I have since looked at other shower filters on the market. The alternatives which stand out are the Aquasana AQ-4100 Deluxe Shower Water Filter System with Adjustable Showerhead and the Rainshow'r KDF Shower Filter With Massage Shower Head. Both are more expensive than the Sprite, and both can only be purchased with a shower head included (as far as I can tell). These other filters cost a lot more. Just the replacement cartridge for the Aquasana can be $40+. Are they any better? I can't really say, as I have not used anything but the Sprite, but certainly worth looking into.-- OTHER SPRITE OPTIONS >> NEW AND OLD MODELSprite make a number of shower filters.The high output (HO) model was recently (in 2011 or 2012 at a guess) updated to have a more attractive streamlined look. That's the one this review you're reading now is linked to. However, the various Sprite products on Amazon seem to switch around from the newer to the older model. It gets a bit confusing. Here is an example of the older style model (according to the picture): Sprite HO-WH-M Universal Shower Filter and 3 Setting Shower Head, White. The newer one is the one you're currently looking at (Here). II am not sure why they older style model is still for sale on Amazon. Sprite have not depicted them on their web site for at least a few years (as of 2014).SUGGESTION >> I suggest buying the newer model, as it looks a lot nicer. The old model (of which I have owned three) looks clunky in comparison. Also, as of today (July 2014) it's cheaper than the old model. ($30 compared to $39)Sprite also make filters that are built right into a shower head. I assume they have lower water output, because the one I am reviewing (and use) is referred to as High Output. I would say it has lower water output because the filter cartridge is small (it has to fit into a shower head). If you have a modern shower and looks are important to you, you may prefer these newer all-in-one units. Examples are: Sprite ARS5-CM Royale All In One Massage Shower Filter Chrome, and Sprite S1ARS5CT Royale All In One Chlorine Removing Filtered Adjustable Spray Chrome Trim Shower Head, Chrome. Look around on Amazon for the full range.They also have models that come with a handle, and the filter is built into the handle. Such as: Sprite Royale Deluxe Hand Held Chrome Chlorine Removing Shower Filter. Again, there are a few options, so do a search on Amazon.Exactly which model of Sprite filter you buy will depend mostly on your existing shower head type. I have only used the Sprite High Output model, and I can highly recommend it.-- DO YOU NEED THE SHOWER HEAD ALSO? SOMETHING TO CONSIDER --The product you are looking at comes with a filter PLUS a high efficiency shower head.The advantage of getting the shower head option (the product you are looking at) is that if you travel you may find where it is useful to have the filter AND the shower head. I find it has better output than many of the shower heads I come across. This is especially noticeable if the water pressure is relatively low, in which case the high efficiency shower head will make it seem like the pressure is MUCH stronger. It's also more environmentally friendly, because you will use less water when showering. Personally, I would get it just for that reason alone, but I am into minimising my impact on our environment and natural resources.HOWEVER, if you only intend to use this filter in your house AND you already know you want to keep your EXISTING shower head, there is really no foreseeable reason to buy it with a shower head. You can buy it without the shower head here: Sprite HO-WH High Output White Shower Filter, Polished White, Chrome, GoldSTILL NOT SURE? At the time I am writing this, the price difference is minimal (less than $5), so if you think there is ANY chance you might need or want the high efficiency shower head then I'd suggest you go ahead and get it.--THE CARTRIDGES--I find that the filter cartridge lasts me much longer than a year because it is just me and my partner using it, and my showers are relatively short and only every second day or so. They can last me for a couple of years before I notice the chlorine smell returning. However, the average household, with average show lengths, you should expect to get around a year from each cartridge.Replacement cartridges are relatively cheap. Here's an example: Sprite Filter Cartridge Replacement Model HOC For High-Output Filter Heads -- just $13.56 plus free Prime shipping at the time I am writing this.--WATER PRESSURE?--In my experience, having used this on MANY showers around the world (I travel with on), this filter does not create any noticeable change in water pressure.TIP: If the water pressure is very high, it is advisable to actually not put the shower pressure on full. If the pressure is too high you will get decreased performance from this (and any other) shower filter. Set the pressure at a level that is still enjoyable, but not blasting out -- if you wish to maximise the amount of chlorine removal.--4.5 STARS, A LITTLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT--One way I'd like to see this product improved is for Sprite to provide a convenient way to record on the filter when it was installed, and thus when it ""might"" need to be replaced. Ever better, would be a small built-in (resettable) flow meter or some way to indicate when it needs to be replaced. I realise, however, such an innovation may increase the price, and may be impractical, although it would also ensure we get maximum usage of the filter, and minimum exposure to chlorine once it needs replacing.--PATHOGENS, AN ISSUE ?? -- (Added, in response to a question raised in the comments discussion on the review I wrote of this product WITHOUT the shower head)One person raised concerns (in the comments) about this filter increasing pathogens in the water, based on the inaccurate idea that removing/rendering harmless the chlorine with KDF will result in a built up of pathogens in the shower head. This is a good point to address. Here is the information I shared in my reply:Even if KDF did nothing to modify pathogen levels in the water, it is not going to directly result in an increase in such pathogens, as you have suggested. But, as it stands, KDF will actually kill most pathogens. Some manufacturers of carbon block drinking water filters will actually fill the central tube in these cylinder shaped filters with KDF granules. Partly because KDF helps with chlorine removal, etc., but ALSO because it will greatly increase the usable life-span of the carbon filter. A major issue issue with carbon filters for drinking water is that over time they can become a breeding ground of bacteria and pathogens, potentially making the water worse (from a pathogenic perspective) rather than better. Inclusion of KDF in the filter helps prevent or eliminate this issue.Something I did not point out in my review is that KDF media will also kill bacteria, fungi, virus, etc. It will also reduce heavy metals (not really an issue for showering), and will also reduce hydrogen sulfide (usually harmless even for drinking, but is what gives some water sources a slight rotten egg smell).Here's a blurb on KDF from one of the manufactures of this material:""KDF process media work to reduce or remove chlorine, iron, hydrogen sulfide, lead, mercury, calcium carbonate, magnesium, chromium, bacteria, algae, and fungi.KDF media exchange electrons with contaminants, changing them into harmless components. During their reactions, electrons are transferred between molecules and new elements are created.""""KDF media control the build-up of bacteria, algae and fungi in organic based media such as GAC filters and in-line carbon filters, extending the life of the carbon as well as protecting downstream RO membranes and ion exchange resins form fouling.KDF process media kill bacteria by direct electrochemical contact and by the flash formation of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide, both of which interfere with a microorganism's ability to function.""---I trust this clears up any confusion about this.>> WARRANTY <<These have a one year warranty from Sprint.

"I've been using barley and wheat grass juice for about 20 years. I use to grow a lot of it myself, juice it, and drink it. In recent years I have travelled extensively and don't have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley/wheat grass. (from this point on I'll simply refer to barley grass, although all statements also apply to wheat grass).In recent years I have watched a multitude of cheap barley/wheat grass powders make their way onto the market. Please note that most of these products are, in my opinion, next to useless. They are made from whole dried barley/wheat grass--cellulose and all. The primary concept of having barley/wheat grass is to have the juice, free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf. All the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure, fresh juice. Then a process was developed (in Japan, as far as I am aware) to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact. That processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder. The result is a high quality product, but one that is not pure juice powder.Fast forward many years, and I come across the grass juice products from Pure Planet. As you will see from my review on Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder I give it five stars.Having used 5 or so jars of this product from Now Foods I have to say the product seems identical enough that I can't tell the difference. However, Now Foods gives you 118 grams for (currently) around $20 on Amazon. The Pure Planet product on Amazon is (currently) around $14 to $15. When you do the math, the Now Foods product is almost half the price.Obviously the many barley grass powders (not JUICE powder) as going to be a lot cheaper, but I really don't think it's worth it. Much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard-to-digest cellulose, and they are far less concentrated. I've tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don't give me the lift I get from JUICE powder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3VRGTJANAPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YE9CRO#wasThisHelpful","R1D3VRGTJANAPM","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very happy with this essential oil, and this product range/brand in general.First some prelude on my background: I do not consider myself an essential oil expert, although I have had an active interest in (and made regular use of) aromatherapy and essential oils for over 20 years.I don't have other sweet orange oils to compare this with, so I can only write about it on its own merits.My email contact with the owner of this brand has me satisfied that he knows what he's doing and that these products are as pure as he says.I mostly use this oil for cooking, specifically for chocolate production. A few drops (perhaps 3 to 5) will add a distinct and delicious orange flavour to about a pound or so of home made chocolate (I make it from whole cacao beans). Because it is steam distilled there are no solvent residues in this oil, and because it is from organic oranges it does not degrade the organic status of my chocolate. It also adds a nice touch to cream of pumpkin soap.Having tried the Cinnamon and Sweet Orange oil, I have now ordered quite a number of Plant Therapy Essential Oils.It should be noted that some essential oils can create or provoke sensitivity in the user if used in an undiluted form on the skin. Citrus oils are particularly prone to do this. What can happen is that the oil will produce a mild to severe immune response (rash, swelling, histamine reaction). Therefore I recommend using this oil in a carrier oil when applying it topically. The same applies to most essential oils, although some are fine undiluted (for most people).I have no hesitation to recommend this oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRP3FDUFW07U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069SQE2A#wasThisHelpful","RXRP3FDUFW07U","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After looking for a case to hold my Canon PowerShot SD960IS I ordered this case from Case Logic. I will update this review with my impressions once I have had a chance to test it out.In the mean time I am posting here the exact specifications of this case, mainly because I had to go offsite to find them, and also because I've seen inaccurate size info shared in other reviews. One review had me thinking my small little Powershot SD960IS would not fit in this case. I found that hard to believe because most common pocket cameras do not come much smaller than the one I have. So I looked on the Case Logic site. The key info I wanted is this: Fits devices: 4"" x 2.5"" x 1.1""Here is the full specifications I dug up online from the Canon site. Perhaps it will help you make your decision:Brand: Case LogicModel: DCB-302>> Fits devices: 4"" x 2.5"" x 1.1""  << (the important info I wanted)Dimensions: 4.9"" x 3.1"" x 2.8""Fabric: PolyesterWeight: 3 ozFeatures:- Camera case compatible with most compact point and shoot cameras- Quality materials and logical organization ensure your equipment is stored safely inside, yet instantly accessible- Zippered storage pocket holds memory cards an extra battery or small accessories- Detachable shoulder strap and belt loop allow for easy transportHERE'S THE UPDATE:I've had this case for a few months now. For such a small thing, I have to say I really like it. I already had a small (tight fit) case on the camera, but it didn't allow for carrying batteries and memory cards in it. That's the main reason I wanted a new case. This great little case from Case Logic is of similar good quality construction and materials as all their gear. The zips a good, and not too fine (meaning they should last). There is enough room to easily have three camera batteries in the front pocket, along with a spare memory card.

By the time he'd finished the first bottle he said he could see again. His vision was far from perfect, but he could at least see faces again, and everything was no longer just a blur for him. He postponed his surgery for a few months in order to continue with the eye wash. I also had him taking Diatomaceous earth powder to help cleanse the body of parasites, but I don't directly attribute his eye improvement to that; rather he and I think it was the eyebright formula. He was using it in his eyes and taking it internally. He was simply drinking what was left in the eye cup after each rinse (not the most savory thing to imagine, I know, but things are pretty simple in this part of the world, and the cost of these drops is high for someone in his position). In all he was having about 4 drops in each eye; 8 drops diluted into just enough boiled water to fill the eye cup twice (once for each eye).UPDATE 27/09/2013: Whilst ordering three more bottles for the above-mentioned friend, I thought I'd leave a minor update. Just to say it is perhaps 18 months since he started and he continues to use these drops each day. He was almost blind when I met him. He says he is doing well (seeing people's faces and the things around him; although not well enough to read). Blurry, but much better than it was. Good enough that he's asked for three more bottles. For a simple fellow living in Panama, these drops are expensive. $11 would buy him at least a week worth of food. So he is happy enough with the results to keep using it. He's still on a wait list for the surgery.>> The story of me and my partner <<Unable to recommend things to people which I have no tried myself, I also did eye rinses every evening for a few weeks. My partner did the same as me, although she worked up to 4 drops per eye, and I worked up to 5 or 6.Here is my process:1) Boil a little water in a saucepan (boiling it any method will work)2) Pour approximately 2 eye cups full of water into a tea cup.3) Add the total number of drops to provide the intended amount per eye. So for 4 drops per eye, add 8 drops in total. I started with just 2 drops for each eye, and progressed over a week or so to 5 or 6 drops per eye. You can work your way up to 8 per eye according to the manufacturer.4) When the mixture is cool to the touch (I test the temp with my cleaned finger knuckle, as it's more sensitive than a finger tip) I fill the eyecup and rinse the first eye by tilting the head complete back, and then opening the eye for a split second or two, and then closing it again. My eyes are clean, so I'd happily drink what the eye cup of liquid before filling for the next eye. I see no point in wasting it, unless the eye is infected or messy in some way.- YES IT WILL STING when you first open the eye into the eye rinse. This is normal and to be expected. In my opinion there is no harm done in relation to this stinging sensation. The cayenne will increase the blood circulation in the eye ball and surrounding tissues. It will also accelerate the absorption and distribution of the other herbs in the tincture.- I open and close the eye until the stinging is no longer too much to prevent me keeping the eye open. Once I can keep it open, I then rinse the eye as per normal, looking around in all directions and making sure the eye ball is well bathed. It takes perhaps 1 to 2 minutes per eye at the maximum... although spending longer may well hasten the results.My experience is that my eye balls would get quite red and bloodshot initially. But within a few minutes this would clear and the eyes would feel VERY soothed, relaxed, and would look very clear and bright. The whites would become more white than before the rinse was applied.I would do this right before bed, and in the morning my eyes would feel noticeably more fresh and clear. It is especially good after a day of using the computer a lot (I am an author and researcher, so extensive screen gazing is common). If my eyes feel irritated, this rinse does wonders. I have no particular eye problems (I'd already naturally reversed eye sight problems I had many years ago), so from personal experience I can only comment on how good it makes my eyes feel and look. My partner's experience was much the same as mine.If you want to know more about the healing benefits of Capsicum, try to find a copy of Dr John Christopher's book Capsicum.  I bought it many years ago, and it is a very informative read about this plant and its healing properties. Dr John Christopher had said that if he was for some hypothetical reason only allowed access to ONE herb for treating all illnesses during his career as a herblist, out of all the herbs normally available to him, he would select Capsicum. He considered it the ""master herb"".>> IN CONCLUSION <<If you are looking for a natural way to improve the health of your eyes, I highly recommend this product.Is it guaranteed to ""cure"" failing eyesight, cataracts, glaucoma, etc.? No it is not, but then neither is ANY other natural or medical treatment. Some things work wonders for some people; give mediocre results for others; and perhaps no results for a few other folk. But are you going to come to any harm trying this out? I see no reason to think so.It's a relatively small investment for what I consider to be a HIGH chance of improving your ocular health.>> OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT MAY BE USEFUL <<- The following is not about Herbal Eyebright Extract... so please only read on if you are interested in eye health in general:As a long-standng traditional naturopath I've met a lot of interesting healers and natural health practitioners. One man I knew in the USA would doing tests with MSM. One of his ways to testing the ability of MSM to open up micro-capilary circulation in the body was by using a special video camera that would film into the whites of the eyeball. It sends in a beam of light that makes it possible for the camera to show what is happening under the surface and within the whites of the eyes. Within a less than two minutes of ingesting MSM powder dissolved in water, you can see the capillaries (some of the finest/smallest in the body) flushing with a healthy flow of blood. They would go from looking kind of mangled and messy, to looking healthy, clear, and disentangled.He was not specifically studying the effects of MSM on the eyes, but instead was using the eyes as a view into what MSM does to the fine capillaries in the body. But my own hypothesis is MSM is highly likely to be beneficial to the eyes, and all the other cells in the body. That was also his conclusion after years of studying MSM. I mention this, because taking 5 to 10 grams of MSM a day may also prove to help your eyes (among other things). Research it, and if you like what you discover, try it out. I only recommend OptiMSM which is made in the USA under very strict quality assurance. Most MSM is made in China with questionable purity. The MSM sold under the brand ""Ultimate Superfoods"" is the cheapest retail source of OptiMSM I am aware of. It's available here: Ultimate Superfoods MSM Powder (16 oz).>> YET ANOTHER SUGGESTION <<I wrote the following in response to one of the comments to this review. I am posting it here as it may prove useful to others.I have found, through experimentation, that a dilute magnesium chloride solution makes a very refreshing and relaxing wash or bath for the eyes. The whole body needs magnesium, and most people are reportedly deficient in it. Many are highly deficient. One of its (vast number of) functions is to help facilitate muscle relaxation. That's what got me thinking it might help the muscles around the eyes.Buy some of this: Dr. Barbara Hendel's Magnesium Oil From the Ancient Zechstein SeaGet one of these (if you don't already have one): Flents Plastic Eye Wash Cup (or any eye cup that takes your fancy)You'll also need some clean, pure water (non-chlorinated... not tap water). You can buy spring water or even distilled water at many supermarkets and certainly at most health food stores.Fill the eye cup with luke-warm water (around body temp or slightly less). Spray 3 sprays of the Magnesium Oil into the filled cup. Wash your eyes in this. The salinity will be pretty much perfect, so you'll not even feel the wash solution. This makes it easy to look around in the solution for a few minutes (as long as you wish). The magnesium will absorb into the tissues in and around the eyes.~AN ADDITIONAL SUGGESTION FOR DAILY USE~If you intend to use the John Christopher drops on a regular basis, I highly recommend following it up (each time you use it) with some drops of pure rose water. Here'e one I use and like: Shea Terra Eau de Rose du Moroccan Distillate Water 4 oz.. Put 5 or so drops in each eye. You will find it very refreshing and cooling. The rose water will providing a cooling balance to the heating effects of the cayenne in the John Christopher solution. You may find it useful to also get a dropper (for the rose water). Something like this should do the job: Ezy Dose Calibrated Plastic Medicine Dropper Straight Tip, 6934 - 1 ml. I suggest ONLY using it for the rose water, so it does not get contaminated with anything else.I wish you all the best of health,Jonathan Evatt- Traditional Naturopath, health coach, and international teacher of healthy living.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1676GJGNLJXS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TQ4D4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1676GJGNLJXS5","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in the tropics, and where I am there are no-see-ums (locally known as ""Chitras""). They are tiny, almost invisible, biting insects of the same family as mosquitoes. Most people have a strong reaction to this little beasts if they are not accustomed to them (takes a few months). I won't use toxic chemical based insect repellents for health reasons. Yet I've had a challenging time finding an effective solution for the chitras. There is a lemon eucalyptus (Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent - 4oz Spray) product which works very well, but I find it is too strong for my skin and gives me a rash, especially if I use it on my face or neck.I have also made up concentrated essential oil formulas with mixed results. Again, by the time I get a mix which is highly effective it ends up being so strong I find it gives me a rash, again especially if I apply it to the face or neck.Then a friend comes to visit and he comes armed with Theraneem Outdoor Herbal spray. He left his bottle with me and today I used it during chitra hour (between 4:30 and 5:30 when the chitras or no-see-ums come out in full force). Normally this is a time of day when I simply have to go inside, as there are just way too many of these biting beasts. But I had to be outside to help a friend get something done before night. With this spray on my skin I was completely chitra free! Amazing. It's the first natural repellent formula I have found that is so effective against no-see-ums. And I was able to apply it to my face, neck, ears, etc., without any reaction. It felt very gentle and didn't give off strong fumes into the eyes.I highly recommend this product. I think it will be equally as effective against mosquitoes because they are related to no-see-ums and are typically easier to repel.NOTE: This product is reported to need reapplication every couple of hours. If you need a longer lasting product I recommend trying Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent - 4oz Spray. It is government approved with a 6 or 7 hour rating (with the same effectiveness as 90% DEET, just 2 hours less in its approved rating... DEET lasts for 8 or 9 hours). It works well, but it certainly is strong... which may be what you require depending on your circumstances. I recommend getting both products. REPEL for when longer lasting effects are necessary, and Outdoor Herbal Spray the rest of the time.Outdoor Herbal Spray might also be more suitable for children, as they tend to have more sensitive skin and REPEL would likely be too strong for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233P1VCRSOVN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YDJ21Q#wasThisHelpful","R233P1VCRSOVN2","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a nutshell, this product is great. I've been using Hawaiian Spirulina for around 20 years! Currently I use this exact one, from Now Foods.

"HERE'S AN IMPORTANT UPDATE TO MY NOW FOODS SPIRULINA REVIEWAs you will see in my original review below, I was for a year or more recommending this spirulina over the Nutrex one. They both came from the same manufacturer in Hawaii, but the Now Foods one was significantly less expensive. Now Foods no longer source spirulina from Hawaii. It comes from a grower in India. I have researched the grower and they seemed to be professional and producing a quality product. So when people started complaining of the bad taste of the new source of Now Foods spirulina, I bought some just to check for myself.Well, I can without a doubt in my mind say that this is the worst tasting spirulina I have ever tasted. In fact, it is one of the worst super-foods / health-foods I have ever tasted. It actually smells like cow shit. AND it tastes that way one might imagine cow shit tastes. I've had special Chinese medicinal herbs that tasted like horse dung, and I could tolerate that because it was something I'd only drink twice a day for about a week... and that was the way that particular herb was meant to taste. But I use spirulina every day, and this new formulation from Now Foods is so bad I have only made three smoothies in since the 1 lb pot arrived nearly 3 weeks ago. The only recommendation I can make is that anyone serious about spirulina stick with the Hawaiian one, with the Nutrex brand. Here's an example: Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 16-Ounce Bottle. I've been using that brand for about 18 years, and it tastes great (well, as great as something this green and powerful could taste).>> MY OLD REVIEW... which no longer stands true <<In a nutshell, this product is great.

"<< A little about background info on Barley Grass Powder  >>As far as I know the concept of drying and milling whole barley grass leaf started in New Zealand, in the Canterbury area. This form of barley grass powder has since spread world-wide, and as far as I can tell most of it is from NZ. I base that statement on my looking into Barley grass products available in Finland, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, Austria, the USA, Canada, and New Zealand. All places where I have lived and tried to source good barley grass powder.<< What is Barley Grass powder? >>In my opinion, ""Barley Grass Powder"" is a cheap and poor substitute for ""Barley Grass **Juice** Powder"". It's like comparing olives on a tree to cold pressed extra virgin olive oil -- when what you want is a nice healthy oil. I tell all my friends and clients (people I mentor on natural healthy living) to avoid buying all the barley and wheat grass products that don't have the word JUICE on them. The data and positive attributes historically contributed to Barley grass is ALL from the use of Barley Grass JUICE. Whether this juice is taken fresh or in a dried (power) form, the fiber has been removed during the juice extraction process.>> POWERED JUICE COMPARED TO POWDERED GRASS <<To start, I should mention that I emphasis the word JUICE because most of the barley and wheat grass products now available on Amazon and worldwide are simply whole barley/wheat grass that has been dehydrated and ground to a dust. It still contains all the fibre / cellulose. It's a lot easier and MUCH cheaper to dry and grind up whole leaf than it is to juice it and then dehydrate it (all at low temperatures).Leaving in the fibre has at least two potentially undesirable consequences:1) Your body has to still separate all the high-value nutritional content from the fibre. This takes energy and digestive strength.2) There is far less high-value nutritional content, as a large percentage of what one is buying (and eating) is just cellulose fibre.Yes, we need fibre in our diet, but expensive barley powder is not the place to try and get it. The whole idea of juicing barley grass (or wheat grass) is that it produces a food that is super easy to digest and assimilate, and has really really high nutritional content, living enzymes, etc.--I've written an extensive write up comparing the various barley grass products available on Amazon. Check out  Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder and see my review there for more information. You'll have plenty of info to make an informed decision.CURRENT NEWS: 12/Mar/2012: Right now the best option I found is actually the Green Kamut Organic - 90 gr - Powder. It's fulfilled by Amazon, so comes with free Prime Shipping (if you have Prime) or super-saver shipping. It's also a good price, considering it has 10g more than the other Pure Planet product I linked to above). I prefer Kamut. It is an ancient grain, so has not under gone hundreds of years of hybridisation. I have no idea how long it will continue to be on offer, so by the time you read this, you may did to do another search for ""Pure Planet Kamut Powder)"".

"*** UPDATE: 18/Aug/2012 - added new info on cheapest brand of this product ****** UPDATE: 13/Mar/2012 -- see end of review for my updates in *** stars.I've just finished writing this review. It is a rather long one. Perhaps my longest yet! But I feel this is an important subject--one mixed with deception and bending of the truth--and it involves your health, and mine.So, if you don't have the time or desire to read a lot of info about barley grass products, here is the short version first. Further down is a longer write-up, for those who are interested.<< THE SHORT STORY >>This is the best barley grass powder I know of. If you want to buy barley grass JUICE powder, this is the one. In my experience it is better than Green Magma and the AIM International products in both nutritional quality and PRICE. Much cheaper.Avoid buying all the grass products that don't have the word JUICE on them. Barley Grass Powder is a cheap and poor substitute for Barley Grass Juice Powder. It's like comparing olives to extra virgin olive oil -- when what you want is a nice oil.Buy this one, try it, and enjoy. PRICE NOTE: This particular item on Amazon may not be the best price, and currently does not have Amazon Prime. Shop around on Amazon, and elsewhere if you want the best price.*** UPDATE 18 Aug 2012 - In the last few months I have been buying Now Foods Organic Barley Grass Juice Powder, 4-Ounce. As far as I can tell, it is an equivalent product to the Pure Planet one. The difference is you get 4oz (118 grams) for about $15 (as of today). Right now the Pure Planet one is about $20. The Now Foods one comes out at about 13 cents a gram, and Pure Planet is about 25 cents a gram. That's almost twice the price.Read on if you want a deeper understanding of why I say all of the above...<< THE FULL REVIEW - FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO KNOW MORE >>For those not overly familiar with grass juices, etc., I'll share a few important points. I encourage you to take the time to read this, as I am sure you'll find it very helpful in navigating your way through the potential confusion of different barley grass products.>> POWERED JUICE COMPARED TO POWDERED GRASS <<To start, I should mention that I emphasis the word JUICE because most of the barley and wheat grass products now available are simply whole barley/wheat grass that has been dehydrated and ground to a dust. It still contains all the fibre / cellulose. As far as I know, this method of producing and selling these grass powders started in New Zealand (where I am from) and many brands source their grass from their. I had personal contact with the people who started that approach, and as far as I can tell they basically do it because it's cheap and easy. It's a lot easier and MUCH cheaper to dry and grind up whole leaf than it is to juice it and then dehydrate it (all at low temperatures).Leaving in the fibre has at least two potentially negative outcomes. 1) Your body has to still separate all the high-value nutritional content from the fibre.

The whole idea of juicing barley grass (or wheat grass) is that it produces a food that is super easy to digest, and has really really high nutritional content, living enzymes, etc.<< THE ALTERNATIVE / COMPETITION PRODUCTS >>As far as I know the first Barley Grass JUICE Power that became commonly avaialable was developed and manufactured in Japan by Dr. Hagiwara back in the 60s (from memory). Since then is has been sold under various labels/brands. I understand the process that was developed in Japan is now used elsewhere, such as in the USA.The main product that is still associated with Dr. Hagiwara is produced by Green Foods: Green Magma - Barley Grass Juice Powder 11 oz.Here is the ingredients of Green Magma:Powdered juice from organically-grown young barley grass, maltodextrin (a complex carbohydrate), organic brown rice.Here is the sugar / carbohydrate content:  Serving Size (2 Teaspoons/6g):  Total Calories 20 cal  Total Carbohydrate 4 g  Protein 1 gAs you can see, it is 67% sugar (a complex sugar, but sugar none-the-less), which is almost entirely coming from the maltodextrin (a complex sugar) they add into it. The rise is also ultimately no better than a filler ingredient.Another long standing brand (since 1982) is AIM International. As far as I can tell they licensed or copied the manufacturing process developed in Japan.AIM has recently changed their formula, which has increased the nutritional content. This suggests to me they have increased the amount of actual grass juice and decreased the amount of maltodextrin (essentially a nutritionally useless filler that is introduced as part of the low temperature spray drying process they use, as developed in Japan). Both AIM and Green Foods use a drying process that involves the introduction of maltodextrin (a sugar). AIM adds in some kelp, which is nice, but there are much more affordable ways to get kelp powder if that is what you want.AIM BarleyLife Nutritional Profile (reduced to show just carbohydrate)  Per 100g  Per 5gCalories 339Kcal 16.95KcalTotal Carbohydrates 54.15% 2.7075g  *(3.25g per 6g)Total Dietary Fiber 4.1% 0.205gTotal Sugar 15.9% 0.795gAs far as I recall, the AIM product use to have a higher sugar/carbohydrate content (similar to Magma). As mentioned, I think they reduced the amount of maltodextrin and increased the juice content.Both AIM and Green Foods make a true barley grass JUICE powder product, but both have maltodextrin which at the end of the day is an inexpensive filler. In my opinion, the same goes for the rice in the Green Magma product, and the kelp in the AIM product.Another competing product is from PINES: Pines International - Wheat Grass Juice Powder, 6 oz powderI have not tried it. I notice they add arrowroot to it. No idea how much.<< GMO STATUS ?? >>The maltodextrin in the AIM products comes from cornstarch (according to their product literature). I would guess the same is true for the Green Magma product. Neither state that this particular ingredient is certified organic. As most of the cornstarch produced in the USA is from genetically modified (GMO) industrial corn, I would not personally use the AIM product until I had it confirmed they are using a non-GMO cornstarch for their maltodextrin. I'd also want to know from Green Foods about their GMO status before using Green Magma. But, with Just Barley available, this all becomes a moot point.<< PURE PLANET JUST BARLEY >>Before I found the Just Barley product I use to go without barley juice when travelling (which is much of the past 15 years). When I am in one place long enough I grow (LOTS) of barley grass and make fresh juice each day. But when on the move, I've had to go without and it's the one ""food"" item I really miss since I started travelling and lecturing so extensively. I tried Green Magma (numerous times) and the AIM product. But both failed to give me the lift I feel when I drink fresh juice. Both felt like they lacked something, and both were very sweet (due to the maltodextrin). About the best I have been able to do is drink fresh shots of juice whenever I find a juice-bar that sells barley/wheat grass juice.In my experience, Just Barley is the real deal. 100% pure, GMO free, gluten free, organic barley grass JUICE powder. No fillers. No cheap rice. No cheap kelp. No cheap and potentially GMO maltodextrin.I now have a new travel companion. For the past two years I nearly always have this product on hand.It is a very light powder. 1 teaspoon weighs in at around 1g. Whereas 1 tsp of the other products mentioned come to 2.5 to 3g. That extra weight is from the other ingredients (maltodextrin, etc.).<< A WORD OF CAUTION (nothing serious) >>My only warning is to be very careful when eating this powder straight from a spoon. If you happen to breath in or out you are likely to either blow fine green dust over yourself, or inhale fine green dust into your lungs which will most likely result in coughing and that will then blast the dust everywhere!!So eat it from the spoon with caution. Otherwise mix it into water (or juice, if you find the taste a bit too much to handle).If you have any questions, feel free to ask through the comments.This review is not a review of the company supplying the product, as they seem to change here on Amazon every week! I always go for the one with Prime free shipping, or at least the one shipped by Amazon.com (if you don't have Prime). As the customer service is then second to none, in my experience.*** UPDATE 12/Mar/2012*** : Right now the best option is actually the Green Kamut Organic - 90 gr - Powder. It's fulfilled by Amazon, so comes with free Prime Shipping (if you have Prime) or super-saver shipping. It's also a good price, considering it has 10g more than the other Pure Planet product I linked to above). I actually prefer Kamut. I've had much less of it over the years, because I normally grow my own barley grass and make the juice fresh. But buying whole kamut grain in bulk is difficult and expansive (not even an option in New Zealand, where I often live). Kamut is an ancient grain that has not under gone hundreds of years of hybridisation. Thus I consider it a more whole/complete food.I wish you all the best of health,- Jonathan Evatt  Author of Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual EnlightenmentP.S.

"[Feb 2013: There's an update near the end]This is a mixed bag of goodies. Some useful, some useless. I'll make recommendations below, that I am sure you'll find useful.I have given this ""kit"" three stars, because most of the extra items are unnecessary, in my opinion, or completely useless. The case on its own, I'd give 5 STARS (once the toxic smell went away).The cover smelt REALLY strong and toxic when it arrived. Like a very noxious leather treatment had been applied to it. After about a week it went away enough that I could use the cover. Until then, the fumes were too strong for my eyes. Otherwise the cover is great. Fits well. Looks good. Protects it well (my Nook has fallen off of the bed numerous times and is just fine). 5 STARSI now see that other folk reviewing this product (in other kit options) have mentioned the toxic smell. I thought it was pretty extreme, and I see I was not the only one. The small has subsided enough (after a few weeks) to no longer be an issue.The light is complete junk. (0 STARS). I've gotta be honest about it. Super cheap mass-produced Made In China rubbish. It's not even designed for e-readers. It can't possibly clip onto the Nook. It can (just) clip onto the leather case, but it's not designed for this and sits way too far up... so the light does not shine on the screen. The little junky catch on the battery compartment broke off when I touched it gently to open the compartment in order to remove the plastic strip that's in there to stop the light from coming on before it reaches the consumer. I was not concerned, because I could see right away that light was of no use. What's more, it runs on three little flat cell batteries, which are bound to drain quickly, and a pain to replace (I prefer to only use rechargeable batteries, for environment and financial reasons).The light I bought (already aware the one with this kit looked bad) is: Mighty Bright Black Xtraflex 2 LED Book Light - it works great. Clips onto the case or the Nook (either way), and can be adjusted at any moment to give you the angel of light you need. (5 STARS, very happy with it)The screen protectors are fine. Just the usual. No issues. As normal, be ultra careful to get no dust at all on the underside when applying the protector. (4 STARS)The wires may come in useful. I've not needed them, but some folk might.The ""skin cases"" seem unnecessary when using the leather cover. The leather case won't fit comfortably with a plastic case on the Nook too... as the leather cover is a tight fit (nicely so) without them. So unless one wants to case change for some reason, these are pointless. (NO STARS, Not required)>> Here's what I'd recommend <<Save yourself some money...Get the leather case/cover, some screen protectors, and skip the rest.This option would do the trick: CrazyOnDigital Slim Leather Case Cover with Screen Protector For Barnes & Noble Nook 2 Simple Touch (Red/Brown). CrazyOnDigital Retail PackageOr if you prefer black:CrazyOnDigital Slim Leather Case with Screen Protector For Barnes & Noble Nook 2 Simple Touch (Black). CrazyOnDigital Retail Package (not sure why it costs more)Get the above mentioned light, or something similar.[UPDATE Feb 2013 - The smell was completely gone in less than a month, even if I stick my nose right on it and sniff. The case is still going strong and I can't imagine my Nook without it. Still 5 stars for the case. I suggest buying it on its own.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.- Jonathan EvattTeacher, natural health coach, and award-winning author of Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment (available on Amazon.com, [...])","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NUZ76CKJJOEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P9EB10#wasThisHelpful","R2NUZ76CKJJOEE","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solar is a great brand in general. As a traditional naturopath I've been utilising Solgar products for over 20 years. They have been around since 1947, unlike many of the supplement brands/companies around today (many of which don't even produce supplements, they just get them private labelled from by a range of nutritional/pharmaceutical bottling companies). Solar products are in brown glass jars, which reduces damage from light, oxidation, and moisture (in general, it's a sign of a quality product).Solar is also very good at ensuring their products are free of common allergens, and great with listing what is NOT in the product. For instance, the Biotin 5000mcg is free of the following: Gluten, Wheat, Dairy, Soy, Yeast, Sugar, Sodium, Artificial Flavor, Sweetener, Preservatives and Color.As a vegetarian, I always choose veggie caps over gelatine. Although even if I was a health-conscious meat eater I would avoid gelatine caps as much as possible.I consider biotin to be an excellent nutrient for hair, skin, and nail health. Using it with a natural source of silica is also useful.5000mcg would be considered a high dose of biotin. So consider this a high potency product. Because biotin in water soluable it's not likely you can take too much (within reason). Your body will eliminate what it can't utilise. It also means it is easier to be deficient in it.This review is not specifically about my experience with Solgar Biotin, because I can't objectively compare it to another source of biotin. However, I will say that I have found taking biotin on a daily basis noticeably improves the condition of my hair and nails. Stronger nails and less hair loss when showering and brushing. But because benefits derived from supplements are somewhat subjective and very dependant on many other factors, I won't get into saying much about what taking biotin will or won't do for you. If you think supplementing with biotin might benefit you, I recommend trying it out and seeing what the results are (after a month or so). I know a significant number of people who see a significant improvement (especially with their hair) when using high-dose biotin. Actually the lady serving me at the post office recently was yet another case. My partner commented to the lady that she had very healthy looking nails. She replied that due to her auto-immune thyroid disease her hair, skin, and nails were previously terrible (weak nails, and significant hair loss). BUT more recently (I am not sure how long, but perhaps a year or so) she had been taking 10,000mcg of biotin a day, and her skin, hair, and nails have improved to what they are now (which looked very good).This ""review"" is to simply provide the full product description. I find it a nuisance when food products don't have their full ingredients listed on the Amazon product page. If you also like to know exactly what you're putting in your body, this might save you from having to find this product on the Solgar site, like I just did. I am familiar with biotin and familiar with Solgar as a quality brand. So I am giving this product 5 stars.<< FULL INGREDIENT INFO >>Here's the full product info from Solgar:- - - - - - - -Biotin 5000 mcg Vegetable CapsulesBiotin is a water-soluble B-vitamin. It helps to promote healthy skin, nails and hair, and is necessary for certain enzymes to work properly. Biotin also supports energy production in the body, and is required for protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism.*Supplement FactsServing Size: 1 Vegetable Capsule  Amount Per Serving  % DVBiotin  5000 mcg  1667%DV = Daily ValueOther Ingredients: Microcrystalline Cellulose, Vegetable Cellulose, Vegetable Magnesium Stearate, Silica.FREE OF: Gluten, Wheat, Dairy, Soy, Yeast, Sugar, Sodium, Artificial Flavor, Sweetener, Preservatives and Color.SUGGESTED USE: As a dietary supplement for adults, take one (1) vegetable capsule daily, preferably at mealtime, or as directed by a healthcare practitioner.If you are pregnant, nursing, taking any medication or have a medical condition, please consult your healthcare practitioner before taking any dietary supplement. Keep out of reach of children. Store in a cool, dry place. Do not use if outer bottle seal is missing, torn or damaged in any way.Solgar's KOF-K certification # K-1250- - - - - - - - - -<< HAIR HEALTH SUGGESTIONS >>If taking Biotin to improve hair health (i.e. to reduce or reverse hair loss, then using non-toxic hair products would be something else I recommend. I've not seen a mainstream hair product that doesn't have multiple toxic ingredients including detergents, preservatives, synthetic fragrances, etc. This includes all the common brands that have so-called ""Natural"" product lines. They typically add an insignificant amount of one or two plant based ingredients (such as an essential oil and herb extract) to their otherwise toxic shampoo base and then call it ""natural"". By ""mainstream"" I am referring to ALL the common brands found in supermarkets and the vast majority of hair solons (the exception might be a hair salon that has taken a special interest in stocking natural products, but I've never seen such a salon).One example of a relatively body friendly brand of hair products is Avalon Organics. There are many others, perhaps better that this bring. Here's a line in their range that has biotin in it. I have no idea if biotin applied externally is of any real value. I've not seen the scientific data backing up this concept, but I've not looked, so it may exist.Avalon Organics Biotin B Complex Thickening Shampoo 14 ozAvalon Organics Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner 14 ozI also suggest NOT showering (and hair washing) with chlorinated water. There are various shower filters that remove chlorine from the shower. The one I have used for 15 years or so is this one: Sprite HO-WH-M Universal Shower Filter and 3 Setting Shower Head, White. I find they work very well. Chlorine can irritate the scalp and skin in general. It also tends to dry out the hair. It can disrupt the sebaceous glands on the scalp and the may interfere with the hair follicles. I know many people who have found showering without chlorine makes a noticeable different in the health of their hair and skin (skin is less dry, eczema reduces, etc.)A source of silica many people report positive benefits from is Biosil. If you are taking biotin for skin/hair/nails, you may find it useful to try Biosil. Of course, if you want to know what is having what effect, it may be best to take biotin and Biosil apart (taking each for a month, for instance). I know it can be hard to resist though... and I tend to take various things at the same time and then use my intuition as a guide to what is helpful and what is not.I wish you all the best of health.- Jonathan Evatt  Traditional Naturopath, and award-winning author of Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W36PVR719I58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OQ4ACO#wasThisHelpful","R1W36PVR719I58","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many of my ""reviews"" this is a long one. In fact it's one of my longest to date. So there is a brief review at the top, for those people who don't wish to read all the information I share further down. If you don't like long and informative product reports, or simply don't have the time to read so much, please read the  >> In Brief  << section at the top and perhaps skip down to the bottom if you wish to see other iron products I have provided links to, including natural food based iron supplements and some info on improving iron absorption in the body.>> In Brief <<My research on Amazon and elsewhere online indicates many people are satisfied with this product. Anyone with an iron deficiency who rectifies that deficiency is going to be happy about the results. That could be said for Feosol, or any other effective iron supplement without digestive side-effects. My concern, however, is with the overall Feosol formulation and the potential effects that may have on a person's health in the long term. In my professional opinion (as a naturopath and someone who for seven years formulated and developed natural health products and supplements), Feosol contains supposably ""inactive"" ingredients which I think are highly questionable at best. For anyone following a holistic approach to his or her own health I would not recommend mid to long-term use of this product unless there was simply no other iron supplement that proved effective for them. Since the active form of iron in Feosol is ferrous sulphate, I see no reason to use this product at all. There are plenty of excellent ferrous sulphate supplements available on Amazon ALL without the strange list of ingredients in Feosol.The ingredients that concern me the most are Crospovidone, FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Yellow No. 6, and Polyethylene Glycol. All of these have ZERO health benefits, do nothing to assist the uptake of iron in the body, and all are potentially detrimental to our health. In my view, there is no health-affirming reason to include these inactive ingredients in a ""health product"" or dietary supplment. Personally I take supplements to aid my health, and therefore give great consideration to exactly which products I use. I think there are cleaner and better quality iron products available with ferrous sulphate in them (the form of iron Feosol products us with). There are also other forms of iron that research indicates are just as good or potentially better than ferrous sulphate.I think there are much better (higher quality, more absorbable, less toxic, etc.) iron supplements available. I suspect anyone who has found Feosol helpful will likely gain at least the same benefits from one of the better brands whilst avoiding the unnecessary ingredients in Feosol. I give a list of many other brands at the end of my longer review below.>> In more detail - The Full Monty <<I was searching on Amazon for a high quality, effect, and natural iron supplement. Feosol had excellent reviews and a high rating so I looked further into it. Before ordering I wanted to know exactly what was in it. I could find no mention of the ingredient list on the Feosol website dedicated to this product. After searching the Internet I eventually found the ingredient list. When I saw the ingredients I got the immediate impression this product was more than likely made by a pharmaceutical company rather than a quality supplement company. I am not suggesting there is anything ""wrong"" with that per se, but many years of working with high quality supplements has taught me what the typical signs are of products made by pharmaceutical companies -- most specifically that they invariably include ingredients I'll almost never see in high quality nutritional products. For instance, I have NEVER ever seen synthetic coloring agents in ANY nutritional product I have considered using or recommending. The quality nutritional brands just simply don't use them. The company that makes Feosol is Meda Pharmaceuticals.Here is the full (as far as I know) list of Feosol ingredients:- Feosol Ingredients -Dried Ferrous Sulfate [(200 mg; 65 mg Elemental Iron), Equivalent to (325 mg) Ferrous Sulfate per Tablet], Lactose, Sorbitol, Crospovidone, Magnesium Stearate, Carnauba Wax. Contains 2% or Less of FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Yellow No. 6, Hypromellose, Polydextrose, Polyethylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Triacetin.~~ Crospoidone: The first ingredient that stood out for me was Crospoidone. Here is a description I found after researching what it is:** Insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone has its name Crospovidone in the pharmaceutical industry and PVPP (abbreviation of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) in the beverages industry. It is crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, white or yellowish to white free flowing powder practically without odor, which is insoluble in water, alkali, acid and usual solvents. It has good swelling characteristics in water without forming a gel.Crospovidone has been used in the manufacture of different pharmaceutical products. Because of its swelling property, it is used as a disintegrant in tablets, granules and gelatin **Here is some additional information from Wikipedia on possible issues with this ingredient:** there have been documented cases of allergic reactions to PVP/povidone, particularly regarding subcutaneous (applied under the skin) use and situations where the PVP has come in contact with autologous serum (internal blood fluids) and mucous membranes. For example, a boy having an anaphylactic response after application of PVP-Iodine for treatment of impetigo was found to be allergic to the PVP component of the solution.[14] A woman, who had previously experienced urticaria (hives) from various hair products, later found to contain PVP, had an anaphylactic response after povidone-iodine solution was applied internally. She was found to be allergic to PVP.[15] In another case, a man experiencing anaphylaxis after taking acetaminophen tablets orally was found to be allergic to PVP.[16]. Povidone is commonly used in conjunction with other chemicals. Some of these, such as iodine, are blamed for allergic responses, although testing results in some patients show no signs of allergy to the suspect chemical. Allergies attributed to these other chemicals may possibly be caused by the PVP instead.[17][18] **~~ The next ingredients that grabbed my attention are the two colorants in Feosol, FD&C Blue No. 1 and FD&C Yellow No. 6. This is the first time I have seen synthetic colors in a nutritional product I am considering buying. As an advocate of holistic health I see no justifiable reason to include these colorants in a product such as this. It's purely for cosmetic purposes, which seems completely pointless when the product will be seen for only a few seconds under most circumstances. It suggests to me the company making this product is likely more concerned about increasing sales through consumer appeal than they are about real health.> FD&C Blue No. 1 is a synthetic dye produced using aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. It is banned in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. I am not sure of what their exact reasoning was but I consider it cause for concern in the health conscious individual.> FD&C Yellow No. 6 (aka Sunset Yellow or Yellow 6):** Sunset Yellow, also known as E110, Orange Yellow S and Yellow 6, is a synthetic coal tar and azo dye and is used in fermented foods that must be heat-treated. It can be found in foods such as packet soups, breadcrumbs, ice cream, canned fish, lemon curd, hot chocolate mix, some jams and jellies and many medications.In some individuals, consumption of Sunset Yellow synthetic dye can lead to the development of hives, hyperactivity, nausea, abdominal pain, nasal congestion and rhinitis.Some studies have shown a link between the consumption of Sunset Yellow dye and chromosomal damage and an increase incidence of tumors in laboratory animals. However, the World Health Organization's review of Sunset Yellow found no evidence of increased tumour incidence in both short term and long term studies conducted on rats, guinea pigs, hamsters and dogs. As such they established the acceptable daily intake (ADI) at 2.5 milligrams/kilogram bodyweight per day. World Health Organization. **Granted the amount of colorant in this product is not likely to cause the average person significant issues, but I personally choose to avoid it if I can.~~ Polyethylene Glycol (PEG): This is typically used as a thickening agent, although that's in gels and liquids (such as body care products). It is also known to increase the permeability of skin and mucous membranes, which means it increases absorption of whatever else is with it. PEG is most likely in this product as a component of the coating or film on the tablet, and/or potentially as a binding agent. That's an informed guess. One possible side-effect of this ingredient may be increased absorption of the above-mentioned colorants. One factor that contributes to these colorants being considered ""generally safe"" or ""relatively non-toxic"" is that they are known to be not well absorbed. The Blue color in this product is considered to have about a 5% absorption, except in cases where a person has increased gut permeability (such as those with leaky gut, Crohns disease, etc.). PEG is know to increase skin and mucous membrane permeability. Sounds like a poor ingredient combination to me.It is also worth noting that, depending on the method of manufacturing, PEG may be contaminated with measurable amounts of ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies ethylene oxide as a known human carcinogen and 1,4-dioxane as a possible human carcinogen. Ethylene oxide can also harm the nervous system and the California Environmental Protection Agency has classified it as a developmental toxicant based on evidence that it may interfere with human development. As the marketers of Feosol do not disclose information about the quality of their ingredients, there is no easy way to know whether the PEG they use is contaminated. This is just one of the reasons why lack of full product ingredient disclosure from this company concerns me. I have emailed the about this and received not reply (after many months).Aside from the possible contaminants, PEG compounds themselves show some evidence of genotoxicity and if used on broken skin can cause irritation and systemic toxicity. I would not recommend ingestion of PEG by people with an impaired gut lining, and that may include more people than many of us realise.I think it is also important to point out that PEG is often purchased with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) in it. Meda Pharmaceuticals does not disclose whether they PEG they use has BHT in it. Look up Butylated Hydroxytoluene online and on Wikipedia to learn more. In all fairness, Meda Pharmaceuticals will need to be contacted to find out if their PEG contains BHT and also what levels of ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane the PEG contains. I have emailed them and await their reply (Oct 4, 2012). (UPDATE: Jan 2nd 2013: no reply received).None of these additives are substances I would choose to put in my body, if I can avoid it - and I can. As for the colorants, I always avoid those in foods, so would not want them in a vitamin supplement (something I am taking to improve my health). What's Really in Your Basket: An Easy to Use Guide to Food Additives & Cosmetic Ingredients lists FD&C Blue No. 1 as a potential cause of neuro-toxicity.>> My conclusions? <<I do not actually draw any specific conclusions about the possible detrimental effects of mid- to long-term ingestion of these ingredients. Each person is different, and we each tolerate artificial chemical additives in different ways and to different degrees. The main issue that comes up for me is that the inclusion of these ingredients is for me an indication that the company making this product has a general disregard for or lack of awareness of holistic and preventative health. Having formulated and manufactured nutritional and health products myself for 7 years I am confident the ""cause for concern"" ingredients I have listed about could have been avoided in this product formulation.For these reasons I continued my Iron supplement search, looking for alternatives.>> The alternatives <<According to the Linus Pauling Institute, ferrous fumerate provides the highest amount of elemental iron, 33 percent, making it the most bioavailable type of iron supplement. Ferrous sulfate comes in second place, providing 22 percent elemental iron. I would say a product with either form of iron is bioavailable enough to justify using it. Ferrous sulfate is the more common iron supplement.There are other forms available such as iron bis-glycinate chelate, (used in Ferrochel), ferric pyrophosphate (found in SunActive® iron supplements), various ferrous sulfate amino acid chelates (as found in Trans/Mins 2 Iron 27+, for instance), and various iron salts such as ferrous gluconate and ferrous fumarate. All of these forms are considered to have benefits over and above elemental iron (except perhaps Ferronyl, which is said to be more concentrated and bioavailable form of elemental iron).For the health conscious (those who pay particular attention to what they put into their body, and recognise that these things are cumulative in their effect) I would personally not recommend this product. Organic Spirulina Powder might be a better source of iron for long term use.  It is my understanding not everyone absorbs iron very well from non-meat sources, so if you choose to use an iron rich product like Spirulina, I think it is important to have your iron levels checked again after a few months of using it daily.As you may have figured out, there is nothing particularly unique or special about Feosol in terms of the form of iron in it (ferrous sulphate is a very common form used in supplements). So why take would one want to ingest ferrous sulphate with all these additives when it can be just as easily and cheaply obtained without them?>> For those not so concerned about what they eat <<For those folk not so concerned about ingesting these types of synthetic, petroleum (and other) derived ingredients I'd say Feosol is one of the more highly recommended ones I could find, and will likely be just fine for you. The price is also very reasonable. I will add that I suspect Feosol is popular mostly because doctor's recommend it, as opposed to Feosol having any particular merits making it worthy of such praise. I think just about anyone who increases low iron levels will feel the product they used is a God send, even though the same result could have been achieved with a potentially safer and more natural product.>> Some other iron products on Amazon <<Here are some other iron supplements on Amazon with relatively high ratings:* Nature Made Iron 65mg, Equivalent to 325 mg Ferrous Sulfate - 300 Tablets. It is also a good price, and it has a few less funky looking ingredients, although still has more than is to my liking. For instance, it also has Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) in it, most likely as the tablet coating.* Enzymatic Therapy Ultimate Iron, 90 Softgels - I've always held this company's products in high regard. Their iron product gets excellent ratings on Amazon, and it also contains important co-factors such as vitamin-C (shown to help the body absorb iron). It also has B12 in it which, although it's not the form of B12 I prefer, is also often found lacking in many people with anemia (depending on the form of anemia).* Now Foods Iron 18mg Ferrochel, Veg-capsules, 120-Count - Ferrochel is iron bis-glycinate (search for `iron bisglycinate' to find the other brands on Amazon with this form of iron). It is reported to be well tolerated with relatively high bioavailability.* Douglas Labs - Ferronyl Tablets 90 Tab - has no ratings on Amazon as of yet. It is currently the only one on Amazon with the Ferronyl form of iron. Google search `Ferronyl' to learn more about this form.* SunActive® iron - there are currently a few products with this on Amazon. Search for `sunactive iron' to see them. Most don't have ratings or reviews at this time. Natural Factor's does though...* Natural Factors Easy Iron Chewables 20mg Tablets, 60-Count - Uses SunActive FE ferric pyrophosphate as the active ingredient. (Inactive Ingredients: Dextrose, fructose, xylitol, natural tropical flavor, citric acid, magnesium silicate, stearic acid, silica, natural peach flavor. Contains soy.>>> COMPLETELY NATURAL IRON SUPPLEMENTS <<<These three are food based iron supplements. If any of those work for you, I would highly recommend them over all the ones I have listed above, and especially over Feosol.These are the most ""natural"" iron supplements I've found on Amazon. They are based on the idea that rather than loading the body with synthetically derived iron (because some experts don't recommend long term use of artificial vitamin supplements, and especially iron) it is better to use a formula of whole-foods known to be rich in iron.If you go for this approach, I'd suggest getting your iron levels tested, then use one of these products for three months, and retest. Just to make sure they are doing the job effectively.* Garden of Life Vitamin Code, Raw Iron, 30 Capsules - For a very different approach to iron supplementation. This one utilises whole-foods and iron co-factors. It gets good reviews. Somewhat pricey though.* New Chapter Organic Every Woman's Iron Support -- 60 Tablets - Has excellent reviews and ratings.* Megafood - Blood Builder, 90 tablets - Also gets top ratings on Amazon.NOTE: You'll also find Bifera Iron Supplement, 30 Tablets on Amazon. Some time after late 2010 it was rebranded as `Feosol with Bifera'. Bifera was made by Alaven Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Meda Pharmaceuticals in October 2010. Like Felsol it also contains useless chemical colorants, and what I consider to be an excessive number of synthetic inactive ingredients.>> A few suggestions <<From a holistic health perspective anemia is best addressed from two angles. One is to increase iron intake (through food and supplementation, if necessary) and iron absorption, and the other is to limit iron losses. For instance, the tannins in black tea are known to significantly inhibit the uptake of iron from our digestive system. Coffee has a similar, although lesser, effect. Taking your iron supplement (or eating foods you would naturally derive iron from) within a few hours of drinking coffee and tea may be unwise for those lacking in iron.Numerous studies indicate the body more readily absorbs iron in the presence of Vitamin C. There are other factors affecting iron utilisation in the body. You can learn about some of them here: parentingscience.com/iron-absorption.htmlUPDATE: January 2nd 2013A quick note to say of the various iron supplements my partner and I ended up buying, our favourite one is from New Chapters. I will say I am very fond of their products in general anyway because they are made entirely from NON-synthetic ingredients (from natural plant sources, etc.). With their iron tablets my partner and I literally chew the iron tablet and eat it. They taste great and feel very ""natural"". Like a delicious (iron rich) snack bar! Of course someone with low iron levels should have their levels monitored whilst using any iron supplement in order to determine (empirically) what's working and what's not. Of course, how we feel inwardly also plays a big part in determining these things.Here's the New Chapter product I am referring to: New Chapter Every Woman's Iron Support, 60 TabletsI wish you all the best of health...JonathanP.S. You may be wondering why I have taken the time to write such an extensive review on this iron product. The simple answer is that I don't appreciate it when I see food, health, and body ""care"" products loaded with unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredients. What I appreciate even less is when Doctors recommend products that contain these unnecessary ingredients and don't suggest alternatives that are potentially more supportive to a person's overall well-being. Experience and research tells me that the primary reason doctors recommend products like Feosol (as opposed to other brands) is that it is made by a pharmaceutical company and pharmaceutical companies heavily market their brands to medical profession (through advertising in medical journals, at medical conferences, etc.).""Number one doctor recommended iron supplement"" PLUS ""list of unnecessary potentially harmful ingredients"" = me feeling motivated to share what I can about the bigger picture on the product in question and other product options.P.P.S. This is a greatly expanded version of my original quick review of this product. One Amazon customer left a scathing comment on my original review. Hearing her concerns, I wanted to write a more comprehensive review that better outlines why I gave this product only TWO stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6C227PTCCYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7QLYA#wasThisHelpful","RR6C227PTCCYY","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been aware of how toxic most soaps and so-called ""cleaning products"" are for about 20 years, and for me Dr Bronner's liquid soaps have been my favourite soap for at least 12 years. Needless to say, I've looked at many options in that time, and in many countries (considering how much I travel).If you're not familiar with the toxicity of common ingredients in most dish soaps, hand soaps (especially the liquid hand soaps, including most of the ones that imply they are ""natural""), laundry products, and household cleaners then please take some precious time to do so. You and your family will be all the better for it. The short story? ALL common ""cleaning products"" are toxic to some degree, most quite severely so. A good starting place is to learn about ""Sodium Lauryl Sulfate"" and ""Sodium Laureth Sulfate"".For further self-education on the topic: A good reference book (and iPhone/iPod app) is available called Chemical Maze and another by the same author called What's Really in Your Basket: An Easy to Use Guide to Food Additives & Cosmetic Ingredients. You'll find the companion iOS app on iTunes (just search for ""chemical maze""). I use that as opposed to the book because I can more easily carry it with me when shopping. A few websites that may come in handy are [...], and doing a search on Google for ""household cleaners ingredient info"" (without the """" quote marks) will turn up plenty of helpful info. Another useful site is [...] (sorry about the odd looking links, Amazon don't like posting of links despite the fact these links all back up the buying of this product. Just remove the spaces and replace the (dot)'s.So where does Dr Bronner's come into this?First off their product actually is ""soap"" and more to the point it is ""pure Castile soap"". Castile is a region in Spain where soap was made from pure olive oil, which made it different from soap made from lard (animal fat). So Castile has come to be associated with liquid plant oil based soaps. Soaps differ from modern chemical ""detergents"". Most so-called ""soaps"" (especially liquid ones) have no real ""soap"" in them... just a toxic cocktail of chemical detergents (this includes most sham-poo, body cleaners, hand cleaners, dish ""soap"", etc.). Depending on your generation, Dr Bronner's might be the first real and pure true soap you use and grow to love... like I am many other folk have.The ingredients on Dr Bronner's liquid soaps are: Water, Saponified Organic Coconut and Organic Olive Oils, (w/Retained Glycerin), Organic Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lavandin Extract, Organic Lavender Oil, Citric Acid, Vitamin E-- N.B. The Lavandin and Lavender oil will vary, depending on which flavour soap you go for (I enjoy Peppermint, Lavender, and Rose the most).>> A few tips <<-- Dilution and dispensers --This liquid soap is super concentrated. It is NOT diluted. When I gave a 16oz bottle to my brother he joyfully exclaimed that it was hard to not use too much! Just a squirt the size of a US quarter on his hand was enough to wash his whole body from head to feet (he has a bald head, so not much was needed for the head). A couple of drops is enough to wash the hands and face. So use much less than you might think is necessary.You may find it useful to get a dispenser and then dilute it with water so less concentrated soap is dispensed. The Gatco 1486 Frosted Glass Soap Dispenser has a nice classic yet modern look, and has top ratings on Amazon. The InterDesign York Short Pump is another with good reviews. If your kitchen sink is set up for it (i.e. it has the hole for one) here's a nice in-sink dispenser: Danze D495912SS Premium Soap and Lotion Dispenser, Stainless Steel. Great for the dishes and the hands. Here is another that has a beautiful sleek modern look: KOHLER K-9619-7 Soap or Lotion Dispenser, Black Black (although quite a bit more expensive). I am recommending a dispenser because I've found it is such a nice compliment to using pure Castile soap in the house.-- Teeth --""If you use that foul language again... I'll wash your mouth out with soap!!""...Yes, I know, most people will cringe at the idea of using soap to wash the teeth, but in my opinion (after years of research on the matter) it is one of the better ways to clean the teeth. Most toothpastes also contain toxic detergents, and other noxious substances. You might like to read up on the information the late Dr Judd presented on dental health, and you'll see why he also recommends pure Castile soap for washing the teeth. I use one drop of the peppermint soap, or I dab my brush onto a bar of Dr. Bronner Organic Peppermint Bar Soap. I must emphasise ONE drop / ONE dab. Any more and you'll be frothing uncontrollably at the mouth like a rapid dog! Comical the first few times, but not pleasant for daily repetition. One does have to become accustomed to the flavour, but it is non-toxic, and I've found if I only use one drop and keep the my tongue out of the way (toward the back of the mouth), then I don't actually taste the soap. I just wash my mouth out with water before allowing my tongue to come into contact with the teeth. Not for everyone, but if you read up on Dr Judd you may be convinced it's worth while (by the way, in my mid 30's I have NO fillings in my teeth... so something is working).-- Spray bottle --Put some Bronner soap into a spray bottle (diluted with water) and it makes a great household cleaner for dishes, basins, toilets, stains, and more. The Peppermint soap (not sure why peppermint in particular) works wonders on blood stains. you can get spray bottles such as Tolco Empty Spray Bottle-- Small Bronner Bottle is worth getting --I travel a lot. I find it very handy to have the little tiny travel size bottle Bronner does. I refill it from my 1 gallon bottle. If you want a travel size to keep with you buy this: Bronner's Castile Liquid Soap Organic-Peppermint 2 Ounces. The bottle is sturdy. I've had mine for a few years and use it nearly every day.>> Conclusion <<I've checked out a lot of soap and cleaning products over the years, including lots of new ones that have come onto the scene under the guise of being ""natural"", ""organic"", ""eco-friendly"", etc., and Dr Bronner's soap is still the best for general purposes. One can't really improve on pure organic Castile soap. There's nothing to add to it (except perhaps some nice essential oils) and nothing to take away from it. It is what it is. Tried and proven for hundreds of years.Buy some, enjoy it. I know you will. And then you'll be buying it in 1 gallon bottles like I do.- Jonathan Evatt  Traditional Naturopath, and author of Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment>>  To see more reviews on holistic books, super-foods, nutritional products, and other healthy-living and self-health products, check out my Amazon profile page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287OU3QH1ISMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U64IU4#wasThisHelpful","R287OU3QH1ISMR","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
">> Coconut Oil in general <<As you may know, natural coconut oil has a lot of well researched health benefits. Many people (including health professionals) consider it one of the best (healthiest) oils we can eat. That, along with extra virgin (first cold pressed) olive oil. Coconut oil has the advantage that it remains stable (does not overly breakdown nor form free-radicals) when used for cooking. I never cook with olive oil for this reason, although I use a lot of it on food in general.If you are not familiar with them, I am sure you'll enjoy reading any (or all) of the following books:- Virgin Coconut Oil: How It Has Changed People's Lives, and How It Can Change Yours!- The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)- Virgin Coconut Oil: Nature's Miracle Medicine- Coconut Cures: Preventing and Treating Common Health Problems with CoconutI've read the first two books in that list, and found them both to be highly informative. I see the other two also got rave reviews, so I recommend them on that basis.>> Extraction method and taste <<This oil, as described in the product info, is expeller pressed and partially refined. Heat is also used during the process. This oil is therefore not recommended for those wishing to maintain a raw food diet. I also don't recommend it as the only coconut oil one uses. Because this oil is partially refined, it does not have the distinctive and relatively strong coconut taste unrefined coconut oils. Most people I know just love the taste of unrefined coconut oil, but they don't always want that taste in all the food the cook with oil.So this oil is great for cooking. It can be used for anything from sauteing to deep frying. With all else remaining equal, I can assure you the food will be delicious and free of coconut taste.>> Health benefits... <<If you wish to derive the full health benefits (and enjoyment!) from coconut oil I highly recommend also buying and using (in smoothies, salad dressings, sauces, body oils, hair oil, etc.) a purely unrefined coconut oil. Here are a few examples:- Organic 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Nutritional Supplement : 1 gallon (128 oz / 3.79 liters) - 1 Extraction Method 1 Location Direct Manila Coco Factory : Not Multi-Sourced, Uniform Quality - Guaranteed Unadulterated- 1 Gal Centrifuged Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil- Certified Organic, Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin Centrifuge Extracted, 1 Gallon- 2 x 1 Gal Centrifuged Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (an incredible price for 2 Gal of centrifuged coconut oil)- Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (8-Pound), 1-Gallon TubI am very familiar with the Nutiva oil (last in that list) and enjoy it greatly. I am also familiar with the product from Tropical Tradition, but I didn't find that in 1 gallon. Here it is in a jar: - Search on Amazon for ""B000VVTTPA 16-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil"" (I've reached my limit of 10 links per review) - it is a very high quality product, and super delicious.Much of the literature (as you'll see in the above mentioned books) considers centrifuged coconut oil to be the highest quality. For first three in the above list are all centrifuged and organic.>> My recommendation <<Use this expeller pressed oil for cooking. I'm sure you'll love it.AND use one of the above mentioned oils (or something similar, or the same kinds but in small containers) as a health supplement. In my opinion simply eating 1 to 3 tablespoons a day will provide many noticeable health benefits to the majority of people. Those with an under-active thyroid (whether diagnosed or not, or sub-clinical, which is very common) will likely notice a weight loss effect (assuming they carry excess weight to begin with... and the majority of American people do). Many people report more energy too, which can at least be partly attributed to increased thyroid activity too.I live in the topics at present, and eat a lot of coconut. I actually miss high quality coconut oil here though, so I bring it down by the gallon from America.Enjoy... and good health.- Jonathan Evatt  Traditional Naturopath, and author of Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment>>  To see more reviews on holistic books, super-foods, nutritional products, and other healthy-living and self-health products, check out my Amazon profile page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ASN51NGOIA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KA7B0W#wasThisHelpful","R20ASN51NGOIA5","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of these juicers came with the house I am living in. I've been using it daily for the past few weeks. It works well overall, although I have been searching on Amazon to see if there was anything better. I've not found what I'd consider to be a better one at the price of this juicer. The potentially better ones cost a fair bit more.It does a good job of juicing oranges and lemons. Small grapefruit also work, but larger ones either stick out around the edge of the press or simply don't fit in at all. We have pretty large grapefruit where I am. I can get around this by cutting the grapefruit halves into half again, or even into quarters. Based on what I've seen none of the juice presses here on Amazon will juice large grapefruit easily.A few improvements for this juicer would be:- It makes quite a mess on the bench if one is not quick to put a second cup (or similar) under it whilst emptying the first cup. The one from Hamilton Beach has a drip catcher attached to it which i understand reduces this problem.- The screws come loose. They can be tightened with a screw driver though.- It does not juice small citrus so well. For instance, it is not so efficient at juicing limes. I think because the skin is so thin on a lime (and limes are quite small compared to a lemon or orange) it does not press it hard enough. I get  considerably more juice from limes using a device similar to Norpro Stainless-Steel Citrus Juice PressIf you're willing to pay a fair bit more, this juicer may be an even better one - Hamilton Beach 932 Commercial Citrus Juicer, BlackI am only saying this based on the description of the product and after reading most of the reviews for it. I don't have personal experience with it, although I may have soon as I am considering getting one.>> Update Oct 9 2011 << I should add that the screw in bolts holding this device together need tightening quite regularly. If they are not tightened then the handle has a tendency to drop down rather than staying in the upright position. This is quite a nuisance. Just a screw driver is required to tighten the bolts again... but they come loose over a few days of use.>> Update: I am sure some  Loctite 38653 222 Purple Low Strength Thread Lockerl or Permatex Medium Strength Threadlocker or Split Stainless Steel Lock Washers (they may not be the right size... just showing an example) would solve the loose screw issue IF it occurs on the latest versions of this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJL03N3XOYX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00563M16W#wasThisHelpful","R3BJL03N3XOYX2","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<< A LITTLE BACKGROUND >>I have a nice yet inexpensive tropical sleeping bag which I bought in Finland some years ago. It's compact, light-weight, and works great in warm climates (I mostly used it in the Amazon jungle in Peru). It's also just fine for ""camping"" in houses. I was looking for something similar for my partner, and bought the Campo Ultralite for that purpose.<< RETURNING THIS BAG >>We took one look at this bag and realised it would have to be returned. The main reason is that the inner fabric is very plastic-like in it's feel. The outer fabric, even more so, although one doesn't have that against their skin all night, but it does make the bag heavier than it would be with a softer, lighter fabric.The material was literally like a relatively thick, relatively stiff, plastic fabric. I'd actually not be inclined to even call it ""fabric"". It really was more like a plastic bag.I sleep naked, and I can't imagine being in this bag for a few minutes, let alone a whole night in the heat. What's more, the plastic fabric is bound to be off-gasing all night... toxic fumes.If you've ever slept in hot and humid climates you'll know that having non-breathable fabric which feels like plastic against your body all night is simply not an option (the word ""STICKY"" comes to mind). We've not tried the bag, so I can only say what my opinion is based on my general experience.<< RECOMMENDATION >>I don't recommend this bag.An alternative one we were looking at on Amazon is Cocoon Silk Mummy Tropic Traveler Sleeping Bag and the Cocoon Nylon Tropic Traveler Sleeping Bag. Both are a lot more expensive but I bet they are way nicer and more comfortable to sleep in. Otherwise, there are not many options for tropic sleeping bags on Amazon. Might be best to check out REI, EMS, and similar large outdoor sport stores.>> UPDATE <<I have since bought the Cocoon Silk Mummy Tropic Traveler Sleeping Bag. It cost me a fair bit more, but it is VERY comfortable. The lining is a mix of silk and cotton. If in the tropics (and I live in the tropics), a nice natural fabric is vital. Otherwise one simply sweats and it can't go anywhere. I am aware, some people might be looking at this bag for a a child... as a cheap lightweight bag for sleepovers, and the like. For a child (especially one that wears pyjamas to bed) this bag (the Campo Ultralight one) will more than likely be fine. It's cheap, and portable, and with the plastic based interior it will be very easy to clear inside and out.For an adult wanting a comfortable night(s) in the tropics, I recommend the Cacoon Silk bag. It's super nice. I live in the tropics, so I only need a sheet on top... but when it's a little nippy, I throw this bag over me. Soft, relatively non-toxic, and comfortable.Another nice looking bag, which is cheaper than the one I ended up getting is this: Suisse Sport Adult Adventurer Mummy Ultra-Compactable Sleeping Bag (Assorted Colors). I am not sure why I didn't get it. Perhaps it was not in stock when I needed it. But it has over 300 reviews, and most of them are very positive. For the price, I'd say it may be a better option than the one I bought and just recommended. Check it out for sure.P.S. It would be nice if those folk marking this review as ""Unhelpful"" would leave a comment to say why. It'd love to improve it, but can't see what else there is to say about this sleeping bag. Please enlighten me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IKPICLC4M7S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OPU1LG#wasThisHelpful","R1IKPICLC4M7S8","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I travel extensively around the world and as airlines tighten up more and more on their baggage policies I found it harder and harder to manage the weight of my bags. Some airlines even weigh hand luggage, to ensure it's within their tight limits (usually just a few KG over the weight of the actual bag). Each time I weigh my bags before flying I tell myself ""I must write a review for this wonderful luggage scale"". So here it is!After extensive research I bought the BZ200 scale and the Cabin Max Digital Portable Travel Luggage Scale.After trying them both out for a few trips I returned the Cabin Max scale and kept the BZ200.Here are my reasons:Both were very accurate. The Cabin Max one is also capable of weighing very light weights in oz and grams. The BZ200 can't do that. It just has LB and KG.The BZ200 I have does not RESET the way it should. Basically the RESET button does nothing, so I push the on/off button to reset it.On face value I actually preferred the Cabin Max scale. But after putting both to the test whilst travelling I realised the Cabin Max one is just too darn painful to use. I am a 6ft 2in man and stronger than most men I know. My hands are also relatively strong. But the Cabin Max scale has a thin little metal handle, and when weighing a heavy bag (mine usually hit the max weight of 23kg) it was painful to weigh the bags because it ""cuts"" into the hands.The BZ200 on the other hand (no pun intended), is VERY comfortable to use. The whole device is a big handle. Easy to hold with TWO hands, and does not cut into the hands in any way.>> ACCURACY <<I had no issues with accuracy on the BZ200 (or the Cabin Max). Actually on a coupld of occasions the person at the check-in counter has said something like ""gee... you must have a really accurate scale... this bag is right on 23kg"".>> TIPS <<* If you are of a shorter height (say 5.5ft or less) then it may help to stand on a stair or a sturdy chair so that you can lift the bag of the ground easily.* Obviously take care of your back when weighing heavy bags... bend knees, especially if standing on a step or chair.* If you are weighing something that is well under the max allowed weight (like more than a lb or 1/2 a kilo under) it is not necessary to wait for the device to beep and lock in on the weight. You'll see clearly enough that it's under the allowed weight.>> PROS <<* More than accurate enough for weighing hand luggage and checked luggage.* Very comfortable and relatively easy to use.>> CONS <<* It can take a while to lock in on a weight. I think this is because it is quite tricky to hold a heavy bag stead enough for the weight to not keep changing a little.* It is quite heavy and bulky compared to some of the other options, but I've had no problem sticking it into my hand luggage after my bags are packed and weighed.* It does not do small weights down to grams and oz (unlike the Cabin Max scale) but in all honesty this is NOT needed for luggage. This is a feature that would be useful for weighing packages for the post and other such small items.* Costs a little more than the other options>> OTHER SCALES <<Of the other scales available on Amazon, I make the following observations:* Taylor 8120 Digital Luggage Scale -- Looks good. It would actually have been my next choice after the two I tried, or if both of the ones I tried were not to my liking.* New Travelon Luggage Scale Micro Digital Black Handheld -- Simply looks too small to be practical for heavy bags. I also don't like the hook concept. I find it very convenient to have a strap instead of a hook* Air Weigh LS-300 Portable Digital Luggage Scale -- It looked to me like too many people were having issues with it.>> OVER ALL <<I am very happy with this scale and it travels with me everywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGJ1DWYDT1SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MBU6K0#wasThisHelpful","R2GGJ1DWYDT1SK","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the 500GB version of this drive, on a 2010 MacbookPro 17"" (MacbookPro6,1).When I bought it (about a week ago) I was looking forward to writing a positive review and posting the times I clocked for system boot-up, etc., before and after putting this drive in.Sadly, this my review is going to have to take another angle entirely.>> NOISES <<I noticed this drive making noises. Like a short chirp or bleep or low-level clonk (not a hard clonk, but a chirpy kind of one). Hard to describe. It kicks in quite often and will then occur every few seconds.The feature list on this Amazon.com product page states: ""Low heat and vibration - quiet operation without giving up storage capacity and affordability"".A consistent chirping sound is not ""quiet operation"" in my definition of those words. The hard drive I replaced made almost no noticeable noise at all (assuming I don't have my ear pinned to the laptop). This one chirps and produces a low-level hum that was not noticeable with the original drive. My original drive was also a 7200RPM drive, so it is not a question of that.I also notice the hand rest area (above where the drive is on a MacbookPro) is warmer than before. So it seems to put out more heat than the default 7200RPM drive. It is nothing major, and not something I am concerned about.>> SPIN DOWN ISSUES & BATTERY DRAIN <<Another issue with this drive is that OS X can not put it automatically to sleep. The drive will NOT spin-down when not in active use. This has dramatically reduced my battery time when not plugged in. I understand this issues affects all Macbooks.So when Seagate says in the features (as listed on this amazon.com product page) ""OS- and application-independent - designed for any SATA standard laptop PC"", it is simply not true. This drive is not designed to work correctly with the Mac OS X power management system. The computer will sleep (and the drive will spin down) when I use the menu item to command it to and when I put the lid down. But it will not do so automatically when running on batteries. I think this will be a major issue for MBP users who need to work unplugged.>> MY RESEARCH & AND FURTHER INFO <<I did some research to find out if this chirp and the lack of spin-down are a known issues, and if the chirp is a sign of potential drive failure. What I found was that a considerable number of Mac users (mostly, but some windows users too) have had serious issues with this drive. Here are some comments I have copied and pasted from the Seagate forums, just to give you some idea what I mean:- ""Using the Momentus XT drive in my MacBook Pro (3.1) for 4 Months, Freezes (Beachball) and dramatically increasing Load/Unload Counter""- ""Freezes very often(2-3 times per min). More frequantly while watching a video/playing a game than just surfing or writing."" (Mac User)- ""chirping constantly unless I turn off APM via quietHDD"" (an Asus user)- ""My system freezes for a few seconds every time a new application is started."" (Mac user)- ""Chirps every 30-120s when system goes into sleep mode."" (Mac)- ""The drive prioritizes, boot & common app launch reasonably well. i'm thinking the occasional pauses/stalls happen between the drive accessing ssd & regular hd. also its possible it's overplaying it's role RE priority etc. The logic behind the concept is good, i think management needs some serious tweaking."" (Mac)- ""System freezes often for about 1-2 sec makes UI sluggish. really noticable in videos and games. I use my laptop for editing and this makes my job impossible. I have put an alternative dirve in and have had no issues but I do miss the speed of the XT if these freezes can be sorted the drive would be great."" (mac)- ""The drive keeps my MacBookPro from going automaticaly to sleep mode, the disk never spins down. Putting the Mac to sleep mode by key shortcut or closing the lid works fine. If the sleep issue will not go away with SD26, I will give up and return the drive. Its very annoying."" (Mac)... there are many more similar reports. Lots of them.Take a look at this online spreadsheet for a few examples: bit .ly /lxdG76I suggest reading this article on Engadget: engt .co /k9krKTIt gives an overview of the issues I am referring to.For more detailed insight into potential issues with this drive, I also suggest taking a look at this forum: bit .ly /ioOVNjAnd particularly check out this thread, which has over 520 posts on it, regarding issues people have had with the firmware update Seagate released to try and fix the issues: bit .ly /jvs6MFAs far as I can tell these issues are mostly affecting Mac users, but some Windows users are also having issues. Considering Mac users make up a small proportion of computer users in total, there are a lot posting on the forums with problems.>> PERSPECTIVE <<I wish to point out Seagate have shipped a large number of these drives. I don't know the exact figures, but hundred of thousands at a guess. Most of those would have gone to Windows users. Obviously the majority of people are not having the above mentioned issues. But a relatively high number of Mac users are. There may be many other Mac users who have not actually paid attention to whether or not the drive is spinning down when not in use, and how much loss in battery time they have suffered. I see Mac users who have written positive reviews for this drive.Having said that, the hard drive is perhaps the most critical part of a computer. If it fails, one stands the risk of losing data. Being able to function for as long as possible on an unplugged laptop is also a major feature of having a laptop. The kind of battery time losses some people are reporting are too high, I think.The chances are, you might not have issues with this drive. Only trying it out will tell.>> CONCLUSION <<** For Mac users: I think that buying this drive for a Macbook has a high level of risk associated with it.The firmware version Seagate has for this drive at this time is SD25.Mine came last week (early May) from Amazon, with firmware SD24. I have read that SD25 introduced more problems for many users. Also note, updating firmware on the Mac is not straightforward. The tool Seagate provides for updating is designed for Windows. To update on Mac a workaround is required.Apparently SD26 will be coming out in the next few months.My recommendation is to hold off on this drive. Wait for SD26 to be released. Check out the forums (at the link I gave above) and see if people are reporting positive results with SD26. If they are, then it may be worth getting this drive.** For Windows users: I think the risk is much lower. I'd recommend going for it, but pay particular attention to whether or not your drive makes odd noises and/or fails to spin-down. If those things don't happen, you should be okay. Enjoy the performance increase on your computer. :-)At this stage it looks like I will be returning this drive. Whilst I was very keen to reduce the boot time on my MBP, I am not interested in having a drive that fails prematurely (something numerous Mac users with the chirp sound have reported, and an issue I understand Seagate has acknowledged), nor am I interested in having a dramatic loss in battery time. Previously I could easily watch a 2 hour movie on this MBP. Now the battery time starts out at around 3:20, drops in a few minutes to 2:30, then keeps dropping in leaps every few minutes, and within about 15 minutes of unpluggin it's dropped to around 1:45.I am giving this product three stars, mostly because I like the idea of it, and would want one if it worked (which was why I got one).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWOCUAY9QFL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NSBF32#wasThisHelpful","R2DWOCUAY9QFL3","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Damanhur: The Temples of Humankind (DTOK) is first and foremost for people with an interest in the intentional community Damanhur (in Northern Italy, since the mid 1970's) and what they have achieved with the construction of The Temples of Humankind. Perhaps you have been there and want a way to to show other people not only what you saw but to show them in a way that almost astounds as much as being in The Temples astounded you. Perhaps you simply know about this place and would like to own and view a splendid production of photos and information on what has been created there. Or maybe you know someone who went there, in which case this book would make a great gift which I am sure they'd be happy to own (if they don't already have it!)Yet having said that, DTOK is for more than just people who already know about Damanhur and these Temples. Anyone with an interest in art and creativity will most certainly marvel at the incredible creativity documented within DTOH. People with an interest in spirituality and human consciousness will likely find DTOH equally compelling. I am sure, that many who read this book will feel inspired to actually visit Damanhur and see them first-hand, and I couldn't recommend that more. So be warned, this might cost you more than just the price of Damanhur: The Temples of Humankind.Having visited Damanhur for a month and spent many hours in The Temples I can say that this book does a wonderful job of accurately and beatifically presenting what is hidden in those otherwise normal looking mountains. In all honesty I think many of the images look even more splendid that the real thing when it comes to the actual detail of the artistic works, simply because photos (well composed ones) have a way of hiding the fact that some of these artistic works are in need of some repair and attention. I don't see this as a negative, but rather positive in that it enables the reader to gain a taste of the magnificence one can ultimately only experience by walking in these chambers and temples in person. What the book lacks in size and scale (the Temples are quite huge when you're actually there), it makes up for by capturing these artworks at their very best.Enjoy this book, and if you feel moved to visit Damanhur and you have the means to do so, then go for it.If this book interests you (and/or you enjoyed it) I think you'll also be pleased to know about:Damanhur: The Story of the Extraordinary Italian Artistic And Spiritual Community, which gives a very thorough account of the Damanhur itself and the people living there (now around 1000 in total)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVWFI091P0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1556435770#wasThisHelpful","RMVWFI091P0U","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the most complete and comprehensive source of information on Damanhur that I have come across. A must read for any person interested in knowing about this community in detail. What's more, it is in English which is ideal for English speaking people interested in Damanhur, because currently English info on this community is relatively limited.Having recently lived at Damanhur for one month, and also considering moving there, I was interested in known as much as possible about the community on many levels. Speaking almost no Italian I found it hard to get detailed information on Damanhur from the people there. Not because they are not helpful (quite the opposite) but simply because there are so many people, spread out over a wide area, and each informed person deals with different aspects of the community, and many don't speak a lot of English. Simply put, getting a clear picture of Damanhur (the people, the history, the way of life, etc. etc.) was proving slow to say the least. After one month I knew little more than I had already obtained from Damanhur info on the Internet.This book came to the rescue. Big time.It covers a broad range of topics related to life at Damanhur. Such as the artwork, the temples, their social structure, how it came to be, the founder, their spiritual views, their rituals, their economic structure, the Seven Ways (spiritual paths for those living in Damanhur), and many other topics.I found this book to be both thorough in its exploration and very objective. The author has conducted many interviews and part or full transcriptions of many of these are included in the book. The book also has 8 full page colour photos and many black and white photos throughout.If you are interested in knowing more about Damanhur in detail then this is the book to buy and read. ALso, beyond just learning more about Damanhur, this book is a must read for any person interested in Intentional Community. Perhaps you wish to live in one or start one? Damanhur is most certainly one of the most successful and longest standing community projects I know of in the world and therefore has a lot to offer in terms of how to go about establish a functional and long-term community.If this book and its topic matter is something which interests you (especially if the colour photos in this book leave you begging for more) then I think you'll also be pleased to read:Damanhur: Temples of HumankindIf you have not already taken a look at the Temples of Humankind website, go to [...] and take a look. If you can get to Italy to see them in person at Damanhur, I highly recommend it.With heart,Jonathan EvattInternational teacher, lecturer, and author of multi-award winning book Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment, the first title in the Wisdom for a Life of Freedom series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXJOHXNJ8K19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592750109#wasThisHelpful","R1SXJOHXNJ8K19","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Supreme Source, for those who have the wisdom to deeply embrace it, is an extraordinary book. I was not particularly familiar with the subject matter of Dzogchen (I knew about it, but had read very little on it) and reading this book says it all.If you are willing to step beyond the illusion of imperfection, struggle, striving, and spiritual progression then I highly recommend this book. I recommend reading it many times over, and taking the time to do this slowly. Dzogchen is not something for the ego-mind to simply take in and rationalise intellectually, but rather something for the whole being to bathe in until its essence permeates ones skin and sinks deep into the profundity of that one Supreme Self that is All.I give thanks to Chogyal Namkhai Norbu for making this wondrous spiritual text available to the world.

"TheSecret revealed in this movie is what some call The Law of Attraction. That much should be clear by the time you read this review.TheSecret is nicely presented. It employs nifty graphics and effects. Good eye-candy so to speak.There are nearly 1000 reviews as I write this one, so I am not going to go into detail about what the movie talks about. Rather, what I'd like to bring to the potential viewer's attention are the serious pitfalls I found in this movie.I found this movie to be very materialistic in its approach to reality and Life. I found it was tending towards a rather narcissistic way of utilising the Law of Attraction (LOA). The movie talks about how a few people throughout history have utilised the LOA to accumulate massive wealth, whilst leaving ""the rest of us"" in the dark. One only has to take a look around at the current state of the world to see that human greed is rapidly destroying the beauty here on this Earth. Human greed has, now and throughout history, created ecological disaster.What I see TheSecret suggesting/implying is that now we can all fulfil whatever greedy desires we might have. It suggests that the notion of limited resources is a lie, and that we can all have whatever we want and however much of it we want. It mentions nothing of inclusiveness toward others, sharing, using the LOA to bring greater wisdom and awakening to oneself and others, and in fact very little that is of true value in a deeper sense. A whole segment of the movie looks at how one guy managed to get his 6 million dollar house -- like this is something we should all be seeking in this world, without considering the consequences.I agree with the principle that we can all experience abundance and prosperity. I agree with the notion that our poverty and suffering is a creation that starts first within the human mind. I like the fact that this movie is opening peoples' minds to the fact that life is what we make it, and that we don't have to suffer our way through this world. I agree whole-heartedly with these points.I do not agree, however, that the solution to this poverty will be found by people continuing to approach life and reality from a separatist/dualistic perspective (there is me, and there is everyone else). The challenge facing humanity at this time (especially those affluent enough to be buying and watching DVD's -- which is just a tiny fraction of the world's population) is not one of ""how can I create and accumulate more of what I desire"", but rather, ""how can I create and co-exist in this world with 6-7 billion other human expressions of Life in such a way that I am intelligently co-operating with those people, the Life within those people, and the Life manifesting as this world?""""How can I use the principles of attraction revealed in TheSecret to add true creative and constructive value to humanity -- to the totality of which I am just one small unit? Is my purpose in this world to simply attract more material stuff into my hands and use?""I found the presentation of The Law of Attraction within this DVD so shallow and simplistic that I am writing an ebook to address the matter. If you find this movie even remotely interesting, or if you too find it to be missing some major points, I encourage you to find and read this ebook in order to fill in the vast gaping holes TheSecret leaves for the viewer to either fill or stumble and fall into.Be well, and enjoy the movie (and the popcorn),With heart,Jonathan EvattAuthor of multi-award winning book Peace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment, the first title in the Wisdom for a Life of Freedom series - available on Amazon.com(Type ""livingthesecret.tv"" into Google and see where it leads you.

"Why People Don't Heal and How They Can (WPDH) is a (potentially) valuable and empowering piece of non-fiction literature in the field of self-health and healing. It sheds light on many truths gleaned by Caroline's personal and direct experience in working with thousands of people wanting (and not wanting) to heal physically, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually.I threw the word ""potentially"" in there for sound reason. In my opinion the subject matter is such that many of the people who might be drawn to read a book with a title such as this are people struggling to ""heal"" (just as I have done when right in the ""thick of it"") and are looking further afield for more answers. If such people, whilst reading this book or after reaching the closing pages, still don't make the choice to surrender into ""why they are not healing, and how they can"" this book may feel like ""salt on a wound"", or ""adding insult to injury"". Many of the poor reviews WPDH appears to have received are likely to have been written by people in this very situation--so I encourage you to hear what they have to say with this perspective in mind.The above aside, in WPDH Myss takes a concise, detailed, and clear look at the very things that may be delaying or stalling your healing journey. She'll lead you into new perspectives and awarenesses around understanding what could be standing in your way and how to step around it. Of course, you'll have to be up for that challenge! My input here is to say that the rewards will make it all worth while (which of course, you already know).WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?If you feel challenged by your wounds, your dis-ease, and the pain within; and you feel like you've been going round in circles or are facing a familiar and insurmountable ""wall""; If you feel something akin to this and you have a humble and heartfelt desire to take a new and even more loving approach with yourself, please do buy and read this book. You'll be pleased you did.If you read it and find anger, frustration, and annoyance emerging... I encourage you to stay with that feeling, own it, and let it tell you its story, without denying yourself the words of wisdom in WPDH that brought you into contract with these feelings. As one reviewer stated, ""medicine doesn't always taste good"", and WPDH is a powerful and effective dose of proverbial medicine for those with a receptive mind and heart.In closing, I shall point out that this work is available in an audio format--great for those who like to listen rather than read. I have WPDH on CD and found it really useful listening to it in the car. This helped the rational (a.k.a. ""resistant"") mind to drop aside, allowing this information into those places it really needed to touch inside in order to be of use and value. I found that having it in audio format and listening to it in the car made it easy to revisit the material again and again-- reasserting exactly what I needed to hear whenever I felt I needed to uncover ""why I am not healing right now, and how I can"".Enjoy.

"I am very familiar with much of Myss' work... having read (or listened to) many of her books and listened to the majority of her audio works.Energy Anatomy I have found to be invaluable. Previously (some years ago) I watched a video series called ""Spiritual Anatomy"" by Myss. I recall that similar material was covered as what is found in this Audio series. So if you have those videos then you may want to consider whether you want to purchase this audio series.I have found, however, that being able to listen to this material over the last few weeks has been a deeply enriching experience. It's much easier to find time to listen to this material than to sit in front of a Television and watch it. Those that are take information in better through a visual medium may wish to check out the videos.Energy Anatomy explores the mechanics of how each of our energy centers (Chakras) processes and magnetizes corresponding levels of experience with your life. This is something I have been familiar with for many years myself (being very intuitively aware from childhood to now), yet I find that the clear, down-to-earth, and concise way Myss explains this metaphysical science to be invaluable.In this material Myss explores and explains the dynamics of each chakra (of our Energy Anatomy [EA]) through a number of different symbolic and traditional models. The EA is initially explored as is -- as she sees it. Myss then revisits each part of the EA looking at it through the model of Christian Mysticism by drawing on the wisdom of the seven sacraments. Exploring the Seven Sacraments in this way also reveals a fresh and somewhat deeper level of meaning and significance as to what they mean and how to apply them in daily life.Myss then revisits each chakra a third time, now looking at them through the symbology and understanding of the Kabbalah Tree Of Life. Talking about the EA from these three different perspectives gave me a number of things: 1. It made my understanding of the chakras and the significance of each one even richer and more complete; 2. It gave me a fresh and more meaningful appreciation of the seven sacraments and Christian Mysticism; 3. It introduced me to a clear and understandable view of the Kabbalah tree of life.CONCLUSIONI highly recommend this informative material to anyone actively interested in metaphysics, mysticism, Yoga, Meditation, spiritual realities, Shamanism, Occultism, healing, and people with an open mind that are studying or practicing psychology.Of all of the things I've read and listened to from Myss I consider this to be one of the best. Not because what it is any better in terms of how it's put together, but primarily because it covers such a fundamental level of understanding the basic energy nature of human beings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33W5GBQK291W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564558800#wasThisHelpful","R33W5GBQK291W3","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off I will simply say that this is, in my experience, an excellent book on the topic of the deeper nature of eye-sight and why (in many cases) it deteriorates.In order to help you, the reader of this review, gain a little insight into the nature of the main emphasis of this book I wish to share with you a couple of personal experiences.I was prescribed reading glasses when I was 15. At that time I intuitively felt into ""why do people end up with deteriorated eyesight?"" -- why is my eye-sight failing?. Intuitively I knew that in most instances it was literally the result of ""not wanting to see"" something within my world and/or within myself. Within less than six months I no longer needed my glasses and now can't wear them (as they no longer ""correct"" my vision, but distort it).About 8 years ago I met a friend of mine when she was 22. She had thick glasses that she had to wear at all times if she was to see much in her world. She'd had them since age 6. They got stronger and stronger every few years. She was convinced (like most people) that this was ""normal"" and she'd have these for the rest of her life. In talking to her about matters of health and healing, I mentioned that I felt her challenged eye-sight was the result of her not wishing to see something from her childhood. I felt it was likely related to her father (who had walked out on her family when she was young). (Perhaps I could qualify that comment by saying that, among other things, I work as an intuitive healer).She thought this idea to be quite ridiculous. A few days later we went to a 2nd hand book store. I found in there the book I am now reviewing. After flicking through it I quickly recognised that Liberman had very similar views on eyesight to myself. I bought it and gave it to my friend to read. I also read it myself. Within no more than 4 weeks after reading this book she has not worn her glasses since. She had to literally throw them away as they were no longer a suitable prescription. She has been reading, driving, living, etc., without all glasses every since (that was 8 years ago). To her disappointment she also could no longer wear her expensive light-sensitive prescription sunglasses. Of course, she was happy to not need the prescription lenses any more...I will add that she didn't have to do much in the way of eye exercises. She did learn and practice doing what Liberman calls ""Open Focus"". I feel this may be a good practice for all people -- glasses or not. It simply involves relaxing ones focus so that it is not drilling down onto the object/view at hand, but rather takes in the entire field of ones vision at all times (at least, whilst in open focus,,, which can become an ongoing way of viewing the world).I am not suggesting that all people who read this book will have the same dramatic results as my friend. I am suggesting that it is entirely possible though, based on witnessing her first-hand experience, and based on the many accounts Liberman shares in the book. The probability of this will, however, depend on you and how ready and willing you are to see the world in a new way, and on just what factors (physically, mentally, emotionally) are affecting your eyesight. We're each different in that regard. What I do wish to share with you is that what Liberman explores in this book is, in my experience, an accurate view of the metaphysical aspect of eyesight and vision. I do not consider this book a guaranteed answer to failing or poor eyesight. It does, however, represent a very real possibility to heal the eyes. Even if you try everything in this book and find your physical eyesight remains much the same, I suspect you may still be grateful for a changed view of the world through Liberman's introduction to understanding more about the body-mind connection.>> Not for everyone, for sure <<For people that rigidly or cynically adhere to a purely physical/materialist view of the world, this book may not be compatible with your world view. So please be forewarned that this might not be the book you are looking for. If, however, you are open to the time-honoured perspective that there is ""far more to life than meets the eye"" (no pun intended) then this book is written in such a way, and presented in such a way (by a professional practising optometrist), that I am sure you will find it of great value. Liberman has a great deal of experience in this field... both as a trained optometrist and as someone that broke away from the conventions of his profession and has since helped significant numbers of people free themselves from the need to wear glasses.I give this book my highest recommendation to anyone with poor eye sight, who is genuinely open to and interested in taking on a deeper understanding of the nature human of eye sight, and to then literally ""take your glasses off and see"". In my experience, this is a fantastic book.I wish you all the best success in regaining your precious eye-sight.JonathanFour-time award-winning of Peace, Power, and Presence.P.S. I have over the years come across people who have benefitted their eyesight using herbs too. There's a formula by Dr. John Christopher that reportedly has good results for some people. It can be taken internally and also used (diluted in distilled water) directly in the eyes. [Please research that method of application before trying it]. It has cayenne pepper in it which WILL cause some discomfort. It is, however, perfectly okay... just a strong sensation caused by the cayenne interacting with nerves... as opposed to the result of actual ""burning"". If that sounds a bit too far left of centre for you... please be sure to research first]. The formula in question is this: Herbal Eyebright Extract - 1 oz - Liquid","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7KL84GO7VY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0517886049#wasThisHelpful","R1E7KL84GO7VY1","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my experience this is a excellent educational film. I have watched it many times with many other people. Each time I see it light a wide range of people up to a new level of expanded appreciation for life, the mind, and the nature of reality.What the bleep (WTB) is part documentary and part movie. The main character is mute and deaf (I assume). She plays her part well... which is one of a woman (perhaps late 30's) facing a crisis point in her life after a failed marriage and increasing stress levels (for which she takes pills of some kind). She starts to have various experiences that gently lead her into waking up to a new way of perceiving reality and to loving and accepting herself. That's the gist of her part in this film.During the course of that awakening journey we get to hear informational input from a range of well respected and published scientists, which is more akin to watching a documentary. Mostly quantum physicists, but also Chandice Pert (read Molecules of Emotion) who has done pioneering work in the field of neuro-cognitive science (how our mind/emotions work and the role neuro peptides play in our lives, etc.). There is also input from Jessica Knight who is a well known channel for a being she calls Ramtha. Personally JK has never been my cup of tea and not someone I take a great deal of interest in --- although I don't disagree with much of what she teaches. She's one of the reasons I would give this DVD four stars and not five. I think JK is a discredit to the topic at hand... but if you like channelled information, then don't take this part of my review into account. I have given it five anyway, as I don't think this alone should put someone off of watching it.I have quite a few friends that have never considered life beyond the physical/material plane of reality. They would consider themselves to be quite conventional in their thinking but they are open to discovering new things. Their comment after seeing WTB the other day was that they resisted it initially (found it too slow) but then got right in to it and now want to see it again. They realized that their finding it slow was actually that they didn't want to allow in what was being portrayed, but that what the scientist eventually touched on simply blew them away.I think that this movie will appeal to a wide audience. From those that know little or nothing about the deeper aspects of reality and the mind, right through to those that are right into much of what the New Age is into and explores. Die-head Newtonian minded people might be an exception, because quantum physics redefines all the Newtonian models our society has come to love and rely on. There are certainly many people that will not find this movie appealing. Anyone who's world view adheres strictly to reality as maintained through Newtonian models and which is taught in most schools and colleges (the world view that much of the western world population adheres to) will more than likely NOT like this movie.If you have any friends of family that have been sceptical about spirituality and the deeper (spiritual) dimensions of life then I recommend you buy them this DVD as a gift. It is a great way to help lead such people into seeing life in a new and more liberating way.WTB explores the notion that there is no intrinsic reality independent of the observer of that reality. It explores the notion that, as far as quantum research can determine, there appears to just be ""one vast mind"" and we each embody and experience our own aspect of that ""one mind"". Reality as we know it really does not exist in the way that our brain tells us it does. Mystics and shaman, etc., have been aware of this for thousands of years... science has now come to the same conclusions. It does clearly point out that quantum theory can not say ""how"" or ""why"" these new discoveries are possible... yet it can say that it's discovered some things that defy what we have come to think of as so ""real"".WTB uses a lot of great computer generated graphics to illustrate concepts and metaphysical realities that would otherwise be very hard to depict. I think this too is a real benefit for people that tend to view life in a fairly ""solid"" way (most people do). Those that have not experienced the less ""solid"" and more fluid aspects of reality (through meditation, spiritual revelation, mystical experiences, or the use of entheogenic plants) can have a hard time imagining reality in any other form. WTB does a great job of making these non-ordinary realities more tangible and imaginable.I highly recommend this movie... to all people except perhaps those that are really strongly attached to status-quo perceptions of how the world and reality is. Although even if you are one of those people, if you feel at all open to new ways of seeing things then you too might find that this movie leaves you joyfully pondering on ""Just what the bleep did I know...""For those that are interested in this film from a technical point of view... Strictly as a movie (for entertainment) I can't say it is particularly well constructed. The script in the movie portion is pretty simplistic and lacking the substance I would personally look for in a film. As a documentary I think it would be fair to say that it lacks the level objectivity and comprehensive depth I would expect from a well produced documentary. Yet, WTB is a combination of Doco and an entertaining movie--a different genre entirely--and in this regard it the result is something that is both entertaining and informative.With my regards,Jonathan Evatt","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVY3Z5J3BVNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006UEVQ8#wasThisHelpful","ROVY3Z5J3BVNY","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those that consider them self a healer; aspire to be a healer; training to be a healer; or are not sure what a healer is... I believe this audio book will be of great value to you.Caroline explores many of the myths, issues, challenges, and important understandings that I am sure all healers will face, experience or deal with a some stage in their career. Her no-nonsense approach is clear and concise.This work is very much a ""guide"". It is not a manual. It is not an instructive work. It does not teach you how to heal or be a healer. Rather it is a general guide to those that work in or wish to work in this field. It is a guide that will assit a healer to be better at what they do. What will also become apparent to those who listen to this work is just how broad the field of the healer really is. From human health through to the health of a corporation... healers have a role in a wide cut of society. Caroline's elaboration on this may be helpful to those who have struggled to identify their mode of healing.I know many healers, some who are very experienced and established in their field, teaching other's to be healers. As I listed to this excellent guide I was constantly aware of just how much this information would benefit these healers that I know personally. Caroline directly addresses many of the issues that I see these healers struggling with for various reasons.Disc 1 explores the ""Archetype of the healer"": Addresses topics such as ""Healers as spiritual midwives"", ""The myth of the wounded healer"", ""How do you know if you called to be a healer"", and ""Knowing your own motivations"".Disc 2 explores ""The Shadow side of the healer"": Topics such as ""It's a shadow perspective to see disease as an enemy"", ""Offering your best without attachment to the outcome"", ""Symptoms of psychic burn-out"" (important for most healers), ""The suffering healer""... etcDisc 3 explores ""Healthy Self-Esteem and the Art of Healing"". This disc often had me thinking of healers I know that are struggling in one way or another... what Caroline covers on this disc is a very important contribution to the art of healing.Disc 4 explores ""Advice for the developing healer"": Topics like ""What type of healer are you?"", ""Spirituality, money, gender, and right livelihood"", ""Psychic boundaries"", ""The role of the healer in the larger world""... and more.This disc, like all of them, also contains a great deal of information that I am sure will be of value to most healers... both established healers and those that are in the early stages of exploring this vocation.UPDATE: APRIL 2010: I still refer inwardly to much of what I listened to in this Essential Guide, and it is quite some years since I listened to it.

"I have read (and reread) many of Joel Goldsmiths books.The Art Of Spiritual Healing was the first one I read, after finding it on my father's bookshelf when I was about 18. It left a very lasting impression and in fact Goldsmith, through this book, set the yard stick against which all my other explorations into health and healing have been measured.I've always felt that no matter what approach to health and healing I am looking at, it is always (in my opinion) dealing with symptoms and this includes all the natural and alternative approaches. Spiritual Healing (as beautifully described and successfully practised by Goldsmith) is the one exception. It goes to the root cause.Of course, many are not ready to go to that place and for some such folk I am sure this book would be a displeaser. If, however, you have a sincere interest in what true healing is really about then please read this book. It is clear, simple, concise. It effectively covers the essential information of what spiritual healing is, how it is practised, it's effectiveness (through Goldsmith's many years of successfully treating thousands of clients), and it's attainment. Spiritual Healing, after all, is a capacity that will all have yet we must wake up to it and attain the fruits of that awakening.Much of Goldsmiths other books will most certainly assist you in that path to awakening to the Truth of who and what you are, and your capacity to function as a Spiritual Healer, and hence I highly recommend his other books too. If you've read nothing of Goldsmiths work then this book is a great place to start.I wish you all the best of health,Jonathan Evatt","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HGIRCOHJVCAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062503642#wasThisHelpful","R2HGIRCOHJVCAP","A249II6VGVRLM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A249II6VGVRLM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Farious and Wikholm investigate what science reveals about Buddhist mindfulness and meditation - and what they found is troubling.Many people have experienced alarming reactions when practicing Buddhist meditation.  Aaron Alexis attended a Buddhist temple, and was enthusiastic enough to tell everyone he wanted to become a monk.  Yet one day he drove to Washington's Navy Yard and murdered 12 people.  A yoga instructor, after 20 years of meditation, suddenly felt her identity fracturing.There are actually a number of interesting research studies that have been published showing troubling problems with meditation.  Shapiro found that 63% ""had at least one negative effect and 7% suffered profoundly adverse effects"" (p 145).  Furthermore, it seems the greater the years a person had spent meditating, the more adverse were the effects.  Lazarus and Ellis also reported that many practicing Buddhists has ""serious disturbances after meditating"" (p 145).Buddhism has a reputation in the west as being about compassion and peacefulness.  However, as the authors point out, there are any number of books proving that, historically, Buddhists have been violent.  Three books on the subject they suggest are"" ""Zen at War"", ""Buddhism and Warfare"" and ""Buddhism and Violence"".  The Zen soldiers in Japan believed Buddhist teaching that this world is illusory, and the other people we meet are also illusions, was justification for killing.""The Buddhist idea, that, by becoming selfless, life and death become undifferentiated; there is nothing to lose by dying...once you realize the emptiness of the self...Takuan, a famous Zen master from the 1600s wrote:  'The uplifted sword...is all emptiness....The man who is to be struck down  is also of emptiness, and so is the one who wields the sword"" (p 171).Nor is Buddhism free of historic forced conversions.  Quite the contrary.  The authors discovered  that, ""Just like Christianity and Islam churches and mosques from pagan temples...Shamanic practices where prohibited in Mongolia from the 1500s, spirit figurines were burned and replaced with Buddhist images...Those who continued to practice Shamanic rites were subjected to brutal punishments or executed...forced conversions...'

"""Universities, like cathedrals and parliaments, are a product of the Middle Ages"" writes  Haskins.Universities began in the 12th and 13th centuries, in what many historians are now referring to as the renaissance of the 12th century.  The Vikings were no longer burning and looting monasteries, and, once again, towns began to be full of people as trade resumed.Certain cities became noted centers for particular studies, such as medicine or theology.  Irnerius, of Bologna,  was a noted scholar of law, and later, Gratian a monk in Bologna wrote the 'Decretum', a standard law text.  Their influence made Bologna famous  for its law school.  Paris became famous for its school of theology - and the unending wrangles between various theological positions.  And here is one fact that surprised me: ""There were relatively few students of theology"" (p 34).Amazingly ""By the end of the Middle Ages at least 80 universities had been founded"" (p 20), many of them still surviving, such as Oxford. Students came to the universities to attain a certificate, the licentia docendi, which would allow them to later teach the subject.  Sometimes a master would bring students to a lecture at his house.  If a large hall was required, Paris  had an entire street of them ""on the Left Bank, the Vicus Stramineus or Rue du Fouarre celebrated by Dante, apparently so-called from the straw-covered floor on which the students sat as they took notes 45).By the beginning of the 1300s the library of the Sorbonne had 1722 volumes, a staggering number considering that every word had to be laboriously hand written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZW5F6NSTS6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801490154#wasThisHelpful","RPZW5F6NSTS6A","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want the orthodox take on the era from the collapse of the Roman empire to the Reformation, then you need this book.  Dawson's knowledge of the era is immense, and his writing is crisp and clear.  And he always find that one, telling point that reveals an era to you.Even as the Romans enjoyed their brief moment of triumph and empire, a tiny, persecuted group would grow into the religion that conquered the empire.  Almost overnight a ""great network of Greek-speaking Churches strung out along the shores of the Mediterranean...to Rome itself"" (p 89), a movement so compelling  that in a letter to the emperor Pliny complains of the pagan temples being deserted, in about 100 AD .  That's less than a century after the death of Christ.""The conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity...marked a revolution...in the history of the world"" (p 118).  Enormous changes came to to the Empire in the 3rd and 4th centuries, when the barbarian incursions increased, and men from Balkans and even from Spain took over the reigns of the empire.The ancient world despised manual labor; Christianity exulted in it.  Christian alms giving ""became so great as to cause a real economic change in the distribution of property"" (p 127).  Some of the great senatorial families gave all their lands and moneys to the poor.  ""Melania is said to have freed eight thousand slaves in the year 406 alone"" (p 127).The Empire, split, hobbled on until Islam swept in bloody spasms across the entire of Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East.  Rome and the west declined into what  some called the Dark Ages.As cities vanished, literacy vanished, and barbarians increased, it was the monasteries which created islands of Christianity and western civilization.  In Italy, St Benedict founded Monte Cassino, writing his famous rule so noted for its moderation and charity.  It was to be the template for a thousand monasteries to come.  Until the 10th century, monasteries alone provided education.Dawson argues ""It is impossible to exaggerate the destructiveness of the Viking attacks""  (p 190).  ""The chronicler of Vendast wrote in 884 '""Everywhere there is nothing but dead bodies....There is no road or place where the ground is not covered with corpses'"" (pp 190-1). In ""the Carolingian territories...the great abbeys were practically all destroyed...the towns were destroyed, too (p 193).  Vikings didn't merely raid and kill and loot.  They also stole  people, especially children,  to sell as slaves to the Muslims.  One man wrote ""the land is reduced to a solitude"" (p 194).Yet these dreadful centuries would be followed by a great revival, a renaissance which is not called by the word.  Towns formed, and soon, guilds flourished and fairs and markets.  The monasteries were rebuilt, vast  Romanesque  churches rose from the ground,  statues were once again made, and manuscripts were lavishly illustrated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N22U8HTBFM59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586172395#wasThisHelpful","R2N22U8HTBFM59","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mangalwadi gives a brilliant overview of the most famous and recent guru movements in India.  He asks of the Divine Life Society ""If God (or unity consciousness) alone is real and ....beyond good and evil...how can....karma, which distinguishes good from bad, also be true"" (p50).  So, he deduces, ""If no deed is actually good or evil, then the belief in transmigration, namely, that on e has to be be reborn repeatedly to take consequences of good and bad""  (p 51) is patently false.Besides, if the world is all illusion, what is even the point of trying to convert people who are illusions?Time and again, Mangalwadi finds that each variety of Hinduism argues against ""the basis for science"" (p 52) by positing an alternate reality.  This is a long standing charge against Hinduism and Buddhism, , made by such men as Whitehead and Oppenheimer.  The pantheistic belief that the world is an illusion, merely a part of the god/pantheistic entity that exists,  explains why China and India did not develop real science.Instead, what was seen worthy was becoming unattached to yourself, to extinguish your personality and your intellect and your reasoning mind.  Accomplishment in this world was regarded as unworthy.The Sathya Sai movement emphasizes individual otherworldliness, just as nearly all the other gurus do, which also explains why India has been crippled by lack of social action movements.  A recent Australian study found the country with the highest number of slaves in the world was India.  But, unlike in western countries where Christianity fueled social action against slavery, there is no movement in India to aid these people.The Swami Muktananda tells his followers to seek to be delivered from the ""'impossible webs of intellect'"" (p 128).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHIA2N3KJPRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=094089503X#wasThisHelpful","R1UHIA2N3KJPRV","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Maybrick case iss fascinating because it is still open ended.  Colquhoun's title said it all: ""Did She Kill Him?""  And the truth is....we just don't know.Florence, an American, married a wealthy Liverpool cotton merchant.  He was much older; she was young and pretty.  Apparently - you have to put this together as you read - he was upset because Florence didn't bring much money into the marriage as he expected,  and he was also annoyed at the way she threw away money on fripperies like clothes.  Still, they got on well at first and the marriage was blessed with two children.Then the husband, James, took a mistress.  And his wife found out.  Soon after, she spent a few nights in a hotel with a gentleman who was not her husband.James was a hypochondriac who constantly dosed himself with the Victorian tonics promising to cure everything - indigestion, baldness, cancer, melancholy, and foot trouble.  And, incredibly, arsenic was an ingredient in  far, far too many of these nostrums.  More than seems believable today, yet it was all too common to use arsenic in medicines.  Arsenic was also a common beauty aid for women.  It gave you the popular pale complexion so beloved of Victorian women.So there was plenty of arsenic in the house, so much that it seems plausible that James could have ingested enough poison to kill himself by accident.What I found annoying was the author interjected her opinions into the book constantly.  She keeps talking about the early feminist movement, and how this must be the reason the murder was such a focus of the press at the time.  Which is to ignore the fact that the it's a fascinating case even today.  Besides, this was a wealthy, attractive couple.

"Putnam finds a huge disparity growing between the well off - who typically  stay in school, marry and stay married - and the dismal downhill trend of the lower half of America.  Once a flourishing middle class, these  are people who seem to be sliding into real poverty.The trickle of unmarried women who once gave birth to the most disadvantaged children in America has now become a flood.  More than 50 percent of the women in America  who are thirty and younger now give birth without being married.  And the statistics on the children raised without both parents  is simply dismal.  All too often, single parenthood leads to failure in school for the child.  Failure later in life.  Drugs.  Emotional problems.  An aimless, unhappy life.It's urgent that the problem be turned around, but how?  He claims 60% of all births to single women - statistically, most of whom are in their 20s and living with the baby daddy - are unplanned.  Really?  Twenty five year old women are having sex without contraceptives and they are shocked, shocked to discover they are pregnant?  Hmm.He notes the vast gap between the behavior of the well off from the behavior of the single mother.  The well off, married mother reads to her children, takes them to zoos, the library, parks, and so on.  The poor single mother, whose baby daddy has just left her stranded with two toddlers, will, unamazingly, not have time to do any of the activities the married mommy accomplishes.  And how is that problem to be solved?Putnam eagerly suggests all the various bromides that have failed.  Lots more money for schools, for example.  Well, sorry, that's been tried, and failed spectacularly.  Vast sums spent on Head Start and similar programs have shown, decade after decade after decade, no real result.  Having Harvard graduates teach in poor schools?  Been tried.  Very little real results.  Look up the research; I'm right.Putnam claims there is ""no clear path to reviving marriage rates among poor Americans"" (p 245).  That may be true, but, alas, it is the only thing that will save the majority of the children involved.  Period.  The reason the children are leading chaotic lives is because the mother is not married to the baby daddy.  The reason there is not enough money and not enough time and not enough serene evenings is all the same.  No lasting marriage.  Even very poor people who marry and stay married, the research shows, manage to raise children well.I hope Putnam is wrong about being unable to revive marriage, because without it, I can see no solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCSIN823VYDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476769893#wasThisHelpful","R2WCSIN823VYDR","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book, with its many charming and fascinating illustrations from ancient China, will interest many. Needham gives the history of gunpowder and firearms and comparative macrobiotics.What really interested me, however, is the concluding essay, in which Needham speculates why science never developed in China. And it is a mystery, one that many scholars have pondered. China's civilization had thousands of years of stable government. And it has a tradition that venerated scholars. China also had a history of many interesting inventions and engineers. Certainly, all the factors seemed lined up to aid in the blossoming of science.Yet science, not just mere technology, real science, with its organized effort to explain and understand nature, with its interest in abstract subjects and its testing of theories, only developed in the west. Why?Needham suggests it was the way the Chinese viewed time. Across the entire of the western ancient world, as well as India and China, time was viewed as a great wheel, with one golden age with great technologies succeeded by a fallen era, when idea would be lost. Then the golden age would reappear, with all the same technologies.What the west had was Christianity, which posited a time which was not a wheel, but which progressed. Christ, after all, came in historical time.Alfred North Whitehead placed the reason the west developed science on Christian theology. This is what he stated: ""There seems but one source...It must come from the medieval insistence on the rationality of God...Every detail was supervised and ordered; the search in to nature could only result in the vindication of the faith in rationality"".From the very start, as shown in such Christian theologians as Tertullian and Augustine, Christians argued that there was a truth. Truth was God. And the truth could be discovered by rationality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8MFJ2SWU5C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VQRIXM#wasThisHelpful","RR8MFJ2SWU5C0","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book was originally published over a century ago, and it shows. And I am not just talking about the ghastly, stilted language.It's the scholarship that's so awful.This book was part of what came to be known as the ""History of Religions"" school in biblical scholarship. It was a theory that Christianity borrowed doctrines from ancient pagan religions. This theory flourished for half a century before it was put to death by thousands of scholars doing research. Not to mention archaeological discoveries that proved much of the claims to be bogus. The author, Massey, was born in 1828, to give you an idea of just how long ago all this was.The theory is now so dead that not a single biblical scholar, atheist or not, will touch it. Anyone interested in the ""History of Religions"" theory should read ""The Jesus Legend"" by Paul Eddy and Gregory Boyd. This is a book you could order today from Amazon, and it gives a good overview of the ""History of Religions"" theory and explains what refuted it. On a popular level, try ""The Gospel and the Greeks"" by Nash, a fine summation of what modern scholarship has revealed. For deepest scholarship, try Martin Hengel's ""The Son of God"".Here are what some scholars have said on the subject: From Jonathan Z Smith's famous essay ""Dying and Rising Gods"" which you can buy on Amazon today: ""The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to be largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions.""Also, from Nash's ""The Gospel and the Greeks"" which you can buy on Amazon today: "" The tide of scholarly opinion has turned dramatically against attempts to make early Christianity dependent on the so-called dying and rising gods of Hellenistic paganism"" (p 162).From Gunter Wagner""That Paul modeled his Christ 'myth' on the myths about other 'dying and rising gods' is now no more seriously held than is the derivation of the observance of Sunday and of the resurrection on the third day from the mystery cults"" from ""Pauline Baptism"" p 266.Massey believed that Christianity had been more or less invented by the Egyptians, mostly because it hadn't struck him that ONE THOUSAND years had passed since the time of the pyramids to the time of early Christianity, and that in that one thousand years the Egypt had first been conquered many times, first by  Alexander and then by the Romans.  There wasn't any flourishing Egyptian religion to pass on by time the Gospels were written.  And no, the Romans weren't heavily into mystical cults by the time of the Gospels either.  It is a laughable theory.Scholar W. Ward Gasque points out that actual Egyptian scholars have refuted Massey's points, one by one.There are hundreds of books on this subject.

"If you have no interest whatsoever in facts, this might be the book for you! Published in 1875 this book is a curiosity but little more. Even in the Victorian era when this was written, this book was considered silly by scholars.That it has been reprinted says some truly appalling about our educational system.There was a period in biblical scholarship when many scholars investigated whether or not Christianity had borrowed doctrines from paganism, especially the mystery religions. If you are curious, look up the 'History of Religions' theory, in any book about biblical scholarship. It lasted from the middle of the Victorian era to about 1920.But all this was long, long ago. There is now not a single credible biblical  scholar anywhere in the world that will argue in favor of this theory. Not one. Massive numbers of books were published on the theory, and whole libraries still groan from their weight.The result of all this investigation? That Christianity not only did not borrow doctrines from pagan sources, but paganism borrowed from Christianity. The earliest Gnostic writing was a hundred years after the death of Christ, for example, yet the Gnostics stole names of apostles to give their works added credibility.As for the subject of so-called 'dying and rising gods' here is a quote from Dr Jonathan Z Smith: ""the category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to be largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly imaginative texts"".Also, from Nash's ""The Gospel and the Greeks"" which you can buy on Amazon today: "" The tide of scholarly opinion has turned dramatically against attempts to make early Christianity dependent on the so-called dying and rising gods of Hellenistic paganism"" (p 162).From Gunter Wagner""That Paul modeled his Christ 'myth' on the myths about other 'dying and rising gods' is now no more seriously held than is the derivation of the observance of Sunday and of the resurrection on the third day from the mystery cults"" from ""Pauline Baptism"" p 266.Want to investigate further?

"Vitoria, a Dominican friar, was Professor of Sacred Theology at Salamanca University, was one of the pivotal figures in arguments about human rights.  In 1532 he published a number of works on the relations of Spain to America.Here is how it came about:  Augustine had argued that the mentally incompetent could not own  property.  This idea was pounced upon by the brigands and thugs who  arrived in the new Americas, and saw all that land.  And all those Indians.The argument of the dreadful ruffians was ""the Indians lacked ownership because of want of reason or unsoundness of mind"" (p 111) which, yes, they stole from Augustine.  So they felt free to appropriate all the land and enslave the Indians.Vitoria responded that the Indians had rights,  ""The Indian aborigines have...the use of reason...They have politics...marriage and magistrates, overlords, laws, and workshops, and a system of exchange, all of which call for the use of reason"" (p113).  In short, ""that the aborigines...were true owners before the Spaniards came"" (p 115).Making Indians slaves had already been condemned by the church, first in 1435, with the bull  Sicut Dudum, which said any Catholic who had slaves would incur excommunication.  Again,  in 1537, Sublimus Deus was published by yet another pope. This bull was intended as the major pedagogical work on the Catholic church on the subject of slavery. It stated clearly that that all the natives of America are men, that they are capable of faith and salvation, so they must never be made slaves, and any Catholic who kept slaves, sold slaves, or participated in slavery, was excommunicated.The arguments of Vitoria was based on the idea of a natural law.  ""International law is natural law, that is to say, the law of nature was part of international law, and indeed was the general source from which its special rules would be derived (p 164).  He proposed that ""the rule of law should be based on reason"" (p 165) and it also had to be ""consistent with the dignity...and his well-being and ultimate happiness in society...should be the aim and purpose of law"" (p 172)..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBRU9LL4FZQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584771100#wasThisHelpful","R3PBRU9LL4FZQE","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a surprising number of pictures in this small book, and a massive amount of knowledge crammed in as well.Monasteries began in the Egyptian  desert soon after Christianity became a licit religion in the Roman empire.  Rather like John the Baptist,  hermits chose to live out their lives of prayer and fasting in the arid emptiness of the Egyptian desert.  Soon two or three hermits began living together, and thus monasteries began.The Egyptian Christian monasteries were ""small towns of a thousand or two thousand inhabitants;  they were divided into houses of thirty or forty ...tailors, bakers, gardeners...and surplus products were sold down the Nile to Alexandria  (p 14).Monasteries spread across the Christian world.  In Ireland, ""Celtic monasticism in its golden age was austere in the extreme; physical penances...such as fasting and immersion in cold water, were severe.  yet...a vivid Latin culture sprang up and a still more remarkable artistic achievement that has put Celtic monastic illuminations and metalwork among the masterpieces of art-history"" (p 32).Benedict of Nursia wrote the rule that was to be the basis for monastic living across the western Christian world.  The rule emphasized spirituality, while it was physically moderate enough to be undertaken by almost anyone. Because of monastic life, there was a renaissance of learning in the 800s that would save many of the classical writings for posterity,  By 1050, the famous monastery at Cluny  ""reached a degree of liturgical splendor unequaled before or since"" (o 52).  Monasteries flourished, so  that in England, there were some 1,000 houses by the year 1200.  Pope Benedict XII imposed the rule that one monk in 20 must attend a university.Then came the Reformation.  The northern half of Germany lost most of its monasteries.

"A biased and confusing book which leaves out the most important historical points.Maxwell - who never includes the other side - ignores all the evidence that many in the first centuries of the church found slavery immoral.  That there were instances of Christians raising money to buy slaves their freedom.  He ignores that and ignores that  the laws of Justinian called slavery against the law of nature.Maxwell actually ignores the entire history of the Dark and Middle Ages, as the church  banished slavery from the majority of the western world, and instead refashioned  both the slavery of the barbarians and the ancient cultures into serfdom.  According to research by the famous historian Marc Bloch, in most areas, especially in England and France, the duties of a serf were to work for his lord for a maximum of two days a week.  Serfs, according to Bloch. were far more like renters than slaves.  (From the book Slavery and Serfdom in the Middle Ages by Bloch).The Viking raiders that pillaged city and monastery were hunting for people as often as they were searching for gold.  They took slaves by the thousands to sell in the Islamic slave markets.  Slavery existed then in Europe in very few places, mostly only on the periphery of the western nations - in the countries of Eastern Europe, which were constantly raided by the Muslims.  Muslims  captured  so many slaves that the very word slave derives from Slav. Whole orders of nuns and priests were formed to do nothing but try to buy back the Christians taken as  slaves in Muslim countries.  Maxwell mentions none of this.Then some Canary Islanders were forced into slavery.  The pope was furious and he promptly issued the bull Sicut Dudum, which was published  in 1435.  The pope  demanded that all who had been enslaved were to be restored to their liberty immediately or those who had caused the enslavement, or who owned slaves, or who bought and sold slaves, would incur excommunication. The pope calls the enslavement of natives both illegal and sinful.  And excommunicated anyone holding or selling slaves.This would be the first volley in a long and sad war, with greedy, immoral  Catholics refusing to listen to the pope.  In South America, wealthy owners of vast plantations preferred not to hear the pope on the issue of slavery, preferred to believe the natives weren't fully human.  And, in just the same way, multitudes of people who call themselves Catholics today pretend to be deaf to the pope and their bishops telling them that abortion is a mortal sin.  Not that  you will read this background in Maxwell's book.About a century later, in 1537, Sublimus Deus was published by yet another pope.  This bull was intended as the major  pedagogical work on the Catholic church on the subject of  slavery. It stated clearly that  that all the natives of America  are men, that they are capable of faith and salvation, so they must never be made slaves.Again, in 1591, Pope Gregory issued yet another bull on the subject, Ci, Sicuti, which reiterated that all who bought, sold, captured, or owned slaves to be excommunicated from the Catholic church.The main tenets of Sublimus Deus would never be altered in any way, and are in effect today.However, some leniency was allowed, not for slavery, but for a later form of punishment. Indentured servants who had essentially sold themselves into a kind of slavery for a limited time, perhaps in order to gain a ship's crossing to America, was allowed, as was the taking of prisoners in war. For limited time, the captured men could be put to work, under very strict circumstances that never lessened their dignity.Anyone interested in the subject of the Catholic church and slavery would be well advised to ignore this book.

"A very strange thing happened after Rome fell.  Slavery vanished, and serfdom took its place.  Was being a serf essentially like being a slave in the ancient world?Bloch argues forcibly that the serf ""was not at all a slave.  ..he could possess land by rental or even as...property to give, sell...inherit...his obligations were...strictly limited by custom"" (p 22).  Bloch's research suggests serfs were closer in their obligations and rights to renters, rather than as people who were owned body and soul by their  lord.  The Middle Ages had a closely reasoned network of obligations between people, and the obligations were frequently equal to the duties required.What was required of a serf?  Was he tied to the land and not allowed to change to a different lord?  Actually, the requirements seemed to vary from century to century, from country to country, and from lord to lord.  Perhaps the most universal of all the requirements for a serf was the work he owed his lord.  ""The  heaviest duties required only a few days of work work per week:"" (p 23) in France and England.  Many serfs did even  less work than that for their lord.This was not the situation in  Germany, however, where the Tageschalken were obliged to work for their lord daily.  .  Drawing any conclusions from the Tageschalken is difficult, Bloch concluded, because from the references it is unclear whether a family was required to send one person  from their entire clan every day, or if every man had to work some hours a day for his lord.Marriage, however, could be tricky for serfs.  It was difficult to marry someone who had a different overlord, or who was free, unless a fee changed hands.  The key here was the obligation the serf had to serve his lord for a day or two in the fields, or to pay the annual rent, which made it difficult to marry outside the domain of the seigneur.In the beginning, serfs paid a yearly tax to their seigneur, which typically was a very small amount.  Sometimes the tax was called rent, or chevage.  Perhaps it was so tiny an amount it wasn't missed, because in some areas ""as early as...the twelfth century the serfs...had ceased to pay it""  (p 37).  Oddly, with apparently no complaint from the seigneurs.  ""The serf was a tenant like any other, subject only to...the obligations attached to his land"" (p 55).Could a serf  move to a different place, away from his lord?  ""As soon as a man abandoned his fields, dependance ceased...In spite of the obstacles that seigneurial powers here and there erected to limit this procedure, departure generally remained legitimate"" (p 77).  This actually surprised me;  I had assumed serfs were tied to their land by legal measures.  They  may have preferred their own land and fields, but when they wanted to change to another lord it appears they could.It was also possible to slide from being a serf to becoming free, just as sometimes those born free could become serfs.  Wars could suddenly change the status of a  family, for example, or a group of small farm holdings could gradually come under the influence of a newly built castle and the free farm holders become serfs.Starting in the 11th and 12th centuries, there was an additional class added between free men and serfs, that of the colliberti.  These are noted in the Doomsday Book, which mentions 858 instances.And this is the most surprising fact I learned:  many people became serfs because they chose to.  ""In the tenth and eleventh centuries...documents ...reveal the existence of a very large number of self-donations into serfdom"" (p 143)For all these reasons, serfs were not comparable to slaves..

The pope was outraged.

"NOTE:  Those looking for a history that covers  the  Catholic church and slavery will need to look elsewhere.  I would suggest ""The Popes and Slavery"" by Panzer.  That's a good book, but I should warn you that Panzer begins with the year 1435,  when the Pope issued a Bull saying that a ""sentence of excommunication be incurred by one and all who attempt to capture or sell or subject to slavery"" any of the residents of the Canary Islands.  He covers nothing in the Middle Ages or earlier.But about this book:  What Brett investigates  are the arguments made about international rights as discussed with regard to jus and lex.  Although many books on international law are silent on anything that happened before the Enlightenment, here is proof that Catholic scholars were arguing such ideas long before, especially in the works of Vitoria and Soto.Slavery had first been declared immoral  in the laws of the west in the 6th century, when the ""Institutes of Justinian stated that slavery violated the natural law"" (p 45).  Although acknowledging the practice, the laws of Justinian called slavery against the law of nature.Yet slavery persisted, especially outside of the western world, in the Islamic countries, and later, in the Americas.It was the position of Vitoria that human law, derived from social consensus, could confer rights and responsibilities.  This is similar to the later arguments of John Locke, and a break with Aquinas' arguments about jus gentium.""All just human laws are derived from 'the first rule of reason'""(p 13), which St Thomas of Aquinas stated, means the natural law.  Furthermore, Aquinas argues, ""any just relationship entails a relation of equality"" (p 19), and must be for the good of both people involved.Vitoria wrote that men can fall into slavery if they are captured during a war yet he insists that ""Christians captured in war are captives rather than slaves"" (p 108).  Men could be sentenced to slavery over a crime.  A more vexing problem were the Indians in the Americas, many of whom had been forced into slavery.  The Council of the Indies was written to protect Indians from this sort of abuse.Aristotle had argued that some men were by nature slaves.  Vitoria's ""answer is to deny that any are inherently slaves"" (p 126).  In the section of De Indis he concludes with an affirmation of human rights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5KYZNE7ZFGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0820423580#wasThisHelpful","R2B5KYZNE7ZFGQ","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Politics!  Theater!  Over the top everything!  All of it combined in Roman spectacle.Beacham unveils a Rome for his readers that was rich with the booty of conquered nations, and Roman politicians spent the wealth lavishly, even on temporary entertainments.  ""Scaurus constructed ...for a few days' temporary use...theater ...had three stories, supported by three hundred and sixty columns...marble...the next glass...the top was fashioned from gilded boards"" (p 33).  Glass?You could be born into the elite, in this status conscious era, or you could claw and buy your way to the top, especially in electoral campaigns,  where voters were bought by incredible entertainments as much as promises.  Status was earned by flaunting money, and ""the mere display of the emblems of status and authority was enough to awed the unruly and restore peace"" (p 35).Augustus, that most wily of emperors, used a wild variety of propaganda tools, including statues, triumphs, reliefs, and games to convince the populace that he was Rome, and he was victorious Rome at that.  He used pageantry and theater.  ""The friezes of Augustus's altar place secular events into the eternal world of myth and interpret them to show that ...Rome legendary history...reach their fulfillment with...Augustus"" (p 133).Beacham stresses how vital the theater was to Rome.  Mime (go figure) was adored in Rome.  Caligula kept his favorite mime as a friend and even consular.  Caligula kissed one mime in public, and the emperor sat transfixed, in his ordained front row seats, at the nighttime performances ""for which the whole city was transformed into a festively illuminated stage set"" (p 173).Sex was included in the lavish, gaudy entertainments  Nero had a raft built for his pleasure towed by ""barges fashioned from gold and ivory and rowed by a crew of obliging young 'joy boys' (exoleti) chosen for their 'lascivious talents'"" (p 22).

"Bauckham offers splendid insights, insights that you will ponder for a long time,  in this collection of essays on John's Gospel.My favorite essay was the last, ""The Johannine Jesus and the Synoptic Jesus"".  The four Gospels had a  ""diversity...was already a problem to which Papias of Hierapolis, at the beginning of the second century, was responding, and certainly it was a perceived problem by the end of the second century"" (p  185).  Marcion tried reducing the gospels to one; the church fathers furiously brought up apostolic witness, attested to by individual apostolic churches and bishops in an unbroken line.By the 19th century, the differences between John and the Synoptics was brought up  by ""Liberal scholars (who found)  the Fourth Gospel's portrayal  of Jesus the least palatable"" (p 186), which is putting it mildly.  Some insisted it was so different that clearly it had been written around 200.  What usually happened with these scholars was that the gospels were stripped off all that was distinctive, and the Jesus they found was markedly  reduced, a Jesus who was much less than the Jesus of the gospels.John is selective, according to Bauckham, deliberately omitting  many of the incidents relayed in the Synoptics, and he makes a point of noting that many more miracles were performed by Jesus than John chose to tell.  Bauckham argues ""only by reducing the 'literal' story to key moments and indispensable sequences  - albeit told in relatively lavish detail - has John allowed himself space to expound the 'symbolic' meaning of it all"" (p 201) especially taken with the interrelatedness of the other gospels.In ""Dualisms"" Bauckham reinters Bultmann, and Bultmann's ""reconstruction of the Gnostic myth of the Revealer and the claim that this Gospel owes its distinctive character to its dependence on this myths"" (p 114).  All pretty much sniggered at today.  Similarly,  Bultmann's Heideggerian analysis has ceased to have impact.  (Okay, picture vast rolling of eyes here) .  In sum, Bultmann ideas have not fared well with time.For that matter, the stunning finds at Qumran have overturned the claims of Liberal scholars that John must have been influenced by Gnostics, (Liberal scholars failed to note that Gnostics were mysteriously unmentioned by the early Christians  for another 40-50 years).Bauckham argues ""that the resemblances can be explained as independent developments...The theological significance of the (light/dark) imagery...can be better explained from other sources"" (p 117) rather than a direct influence by Qumran.  Bauckham concludes ""that soteriology is the central concern in the Gospel's prominent use of dualisms"" (pp 128-9).  And this is a simply wonderful line by Bauckham: ""Light dispels darkness, requiring decision, while the world that rejects Jesus is conquered and saved by him through its rejection of him"" (p 129).John is notable for the emphasis he places on individualism.  In the essay ""Individualism""  Bauckham points to 'aphoristic sayings about the individual's relationship with Jesus"" (p 4) in an ancient society that emphasized the collective nature of society, rather than the person.  Various scholars have attempted ""to find parallels to this Johannine language in Philo...or even Ignatius"" (p 12), but in fact the language is unique to John.Yet John also underlines 'oneness',  The Father and Son are one (hen) Jesus says in John 10:30, a statement which ""could not fail to recall the Shema for any Jewish hearer"" (p 32).  Christian is urged to become part of the love between the Father and the Son.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XH54ZLDHTLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080109612X#wasThisHelpful","R17XH54ZLDHTLF","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Morton paints the young Duke as  a petulant narcissist, irked by  the chores required of a future king.  As a young adult, although he set female hearts fluttering, his family was deeply unhappy about his heavy drinking, his mistresses, and the racy set he partied with, a group increasingly pro German in the 1930s.Then he met the future Duchess. a woman who was very much married.  In one year alone, the king lavished the modern equivalent of 11 million dollars in gifts of jewelry to the always acquisitive Duchess.  This was a woman who was not only cheating on her husband, but she may have had an affair with von Ribbentrop.  Gossip suggested he sent her 17 carnations every day as a sign of the 17 times they had  gone to bed together.  And there may even have been another young man she was showering gifts upon.The king  ended up giving up the throne for this woman.  After the abdication, and a few years before the start of the war, the now  Duke and Duchess made a triumphant tour through Germany, ending with a meeting with Hitler himself.  This in itself was not too awful - the nations were not at war, and the former king apparently longed to live in the spotlight again, with all those cheering crowds.But later, were the Duke and Duchess traitors?That's the crux of the book.  Before the US entered the war, before Pearl Harbor, when Germany was bombing the heck out of London, there was a period when people fled  the war in France.  The Duke and Duchess ended up first in Spain, and then in Portugal.  It was during this time that the former king of Great Britain flirted with ideas from German agents that he could ascend the throne again, following a peace agreement between the two countries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CA3MI20KBEWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455527114#wasThisHelpful","R2CA3MI20KBEWH","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone familiar with biblical scholars will have heard of Emanuel Tov, perhaps the most respected scholar  writing about the Old Testament today.""Textual Criticism"" is a large book - almost 500 pages - but it is chock full of charts, and something really fascinating to anyone interested in the history of the bible: actual photographs of the ancient texts.  Really, this is an invaluable guide for anyone interested in the subject.  It is less a book that you would read straight through than a collection of essays giving information on the state of our knowledge on the Old Testament.The state of our knowledge about the Old Testament is much more fragmentary and more controversial than that of the New Testament.  Much has been revolutionized, however, since the finding of the Dead Sea scrolls.  One interesting argument:  Tov notes that it takes time for a all the old ideas to be swept away in light of the new finds.  It may well be decades, or longer, before a new consensus is reached.Tov points out that ""Interest in the text of Scripture began in the first centuries CE when learned church fathers compared the text of Jewish Scripture to the Greek version"" (p 19) but the truly critical scrutiny began in the 17th century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8OC3GV9GL87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800696646#wasThisHelpful","R3K8OC3GV9GL87","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christianity revolutionized the treatment of children in the ancient world.  Perhaps the most spectacular alteration was in the use of children as sexual playthings.  Both ancient Greece and ancient Rome regarded using little boys, especially slaves, or the children of the poor, as objects of desire.A slave had no rights over his body, and it was regarded as legal and not immoral in the least to use the slave sexually.  Both little boys and little girls were used sexually, although it appears little boys were preferred.  The boys were considered of interest sexually until they sprouted body hair, which gives some idea of the age of the children abused.  After the master had used the slave, the slave could also obtain money for his master by being sent to one of the many boy brothels in Rome.  (Pick up a copy of ""The Economy of Prostitution in Rome"" for a fuller treatment).Christianity, of course, viewed this as utterly immoral.  Many Christians wrote scathing denunciations of such practices, such as Tatian, who pointed out that,  at least in this matter, the barbarians, whose cultures despised  such things,  were more moral.  Tatian bitterly criticized ""the Romans...for gathering herds of boys for this purpose"" (p 230).In the  area of protecting children ""from sexual advances...may be the one area of morality in which early Christianity was truly counter-cultural"" (p 231).The ancient world, including the Second Temple Jews, regarded a girl as ready for marriage between the ages of 12 to 14.  Boys, on the other hand, appear to have been older at the age of marriage, perhaps in the late teens or early twenties.  This seems to have held true across all the cultures in the Roman empire.Where Jewish and later Christians differed from the other cultures was the importance they placed on the child.  ""In significant strands of Judaism, the family is based upon the child"" (p 72).  Because every child had an immortal soul, Christians  taught their children early the truths of Christianity and brought them to Christian gatherings to participate.  ""The process of socializing children into the Christian Church was closely related to the quality and extent of the religious education and formation the children received"" (p 271).They also strove to keep their children from the immoral influences all around them.  John Chrysostrom insisted young men should be kept away from the theater, for example, since ''the sight of naked women uttering shameful words'"" (p 157) should be avoided.  Chrysostrom urged boys to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays, pray, and to be taught to fear hell.Children had toys and games similar to many today.  One I had never heard of was tying a rattle around the neck of a baby.  Every time the baby moved, the rattle would jingle and amuse the child.  Tops, hoops, balls, and dolls were all available, although many of the dolls appear to be based on pagan gods, and therefore were likely unused by Christian children.I would also strongly recommend the book ""When Children Became People"", which also deals with the changes Christianity brought to the ancient world for children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1Q6GMVMEWUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813216745#wasThisHelpful","R1E1Q6GMVMEWUH","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christians will be deeply hurt by this book.  Chopra has written a number of books mocking or denigrating Christianity, and I am sorry to say this is yet another one.Here's  the enlightened Chopra sneering at  Christians:  ""The church needed a scare tactic to keep the sheep in line""  (p 253) and ""The decline of faith in our time indicates that obedience is out of fashion"" (p 262).And here is the loving, kindly, enlightened Chopra on what we should do with the Christian God: ""Kill God.  Yes, maybe that's a good idea"" (p 141 )  and ""Now we have something to believe in together.  Let's kill God.  I'm ready."" (p 141).Chopra  apparently hates Jesus Christ with a shivering, feverish loathing.  ""'I hated the God that kids are brainwashed into loving and worshiping.  That God is a fraud, a cheat.  He doesn't exist'"" (p 143).  Not that he offers any proof.  But in order to join his mystery school and be  someone Chopra approves of, you have to ""push the church out of the way"" (p 127).Chopra's book insultingly calls St John ""an idiot and a fanatic....But his side won...The crazies came up with a bizarre myth"" (pp 253-4).  This is deeply wounding to Christians, and so cruel.Another indirect slam against Christ is his frequently repeated, ""Everything is a miracle or nothing is"", which simply makes no sense.  Sure, a baby and a rose can be called miracles, but when Christ rose from the dead after three days that was a miracle in a very true, very gritty sense than Chopra certainly can't duplicate.  He can't even duplicate the smaller but real miracles that still occur, like the ones at Lourdes where an organ that has been removed miraculously reappears, or the miracle of the sun dancing at Fatima, seen by 70,000 people.Christians will also be hurt by his distortions about their faith.  ""No word is more important in the New Testament than 'light'"" (p 265), he insists.  Which is simply not true.  What about the word God, Chopra?  Oh, wait.  Chopra wants to see God destroyed, but he approves of a vague inner 'light' that the chosen among us possess.This light isn't the Christian God, and certainly isn't absolute truth, so the followers Chopra expects in his mystery schools won't have to bother about any of  that pesky stuff about right and wrong.  Forget having to do anything, especially anything unpleasant, and instead concentrate on  finding out how to ""see your true self"" (p 271) because everything is all about me, me, me.  I cringed at Chopra's advice, which seemed aimed at growing  vanity.  The mystery school followers of Chopra need to  ""see ourselves as pure light"" (p 272), he soothingly assures his preening audience.  If Chopra is pure light, how can he call Christians ""crazies""?""True belief rests on personal experience"" (p 273) he pontificates.  If you wonder if you are special enough to join the mystery school, you will find proof if ""The forces of nature support you"".  Yes, he really wrote that.  What, palm trees bow down to you?  Flower petals scatter themselves under your feet?  Also,""You experience the timeless...You feel in control....You feel free... Your choices expand...You feel a sense of acceptance that makes blame and guilt pointless"" (pp273-4).  I am shocked, shocked to learn  Chopra has done away with guilt.Besides, Chopra grousingly points out, ""Jesus'... teachings are impossible, from loving your neighbor as yourself to turning the other cheek"" (p 272).  Funny thing then about  Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Father Damian of Molokai, not to mention the kindly couple down the street who take in foster children out of the kindness of their hearts.Chopra tells his followers ""You are an unbounded field of infinite possibilities.  You are infinite consciousness manifesting in space-time"" (p 267) but even though you are infinite consciousness and staggeringly wonderful it's just too, too hard to try to turn the other cheek and love your neighbor as yourself.Practically foaming at the mouth at the mere mention of Christianity and God - the man really needs to learn not to be such a hating hater -  Chopra invents for his book a  13th disciple who knew the  real truth about  Jesus.  Which, Chopra insists,  had nothing to do with Jesus Christ, or Christianity, or  anything else that  Chopra hates.So what's left, after shoving Christianity to the trash bin?  Chopra, that's what!  Chopra, who has grown extremely wealthy by being  guru to such light filled members of society as Kim Kardashian and Michael Jackson.  Chopra called Michael 'the most spiritual person with whom he has ever worked' .  I am not making any of this up.The spirituality Chopra's pushing is New Age, blended with a dash  of old time Gnosticism and Hinduism.  Chopra shucks off  Gnostic condemnation of flesh, women, and life on earth, just as he ignores the the predetermination and the fatalistic cycles of Hinduism or any suggestion that you might reincarnate as a worm.  Instead, he's writing to narcissists who know, deep within their wonderful inner selves, that they themselves are God.  Well, god, maybe.Really.  I am not making this up.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEEX4I68BIOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062241303#wasThisHelpful","RAEEX4I68BIOI","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yancey pulls together research  that  proves how much hostility there is against Christians.  This hostility, bordering on hatred,  is especially found in the chattering classes and the cultural progressives.  Although this is a short book, Yancey presents research study finding after another research study, all showing that Christians have become the Other for a large segment of the American public.For example, when asked if they would rather have a politically vocal Republican as a neighbor, or an apolitical Christian, a staggering 49.3 showed greater antipathy for  Christians.  Hostility was highest among the well educated and wealthy.  And I am shocked, shocked to reveal that ""The traditional values promoted by Christians can be seen as interfering with the rights of others to practice...progressive sexual freedoms"" (p 55).  Gosh, could there be a connection between that and their hatred?To go by the studies, many cultural progressives have dehumanized Christians, finding in them the Other.  ""Those with anti-Christian perspectives perceive themselves as enjoying an enlightenment that has eluded conservative Christians"" (p 64).  Cultural progressives denounce, above all things, judging other people, and they judge Christians to be  - and these are the very words found in research -  superstitious, ignorant, irrational bigots desiring of forcing a theocracy upon them, and above all they see them as intolerant.Because none of them has ever heard of logic.  Or irony.Yancey points out that ""Previous research has documented the existence of intolerance and bias among progressives"" (p 86), and his new research, mostly from Pew, only underlines the problem.This is a very troubling book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVB5PGMLZ4KIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442224061#wasThisHelpful","RVB5PGMLZ4KIQ","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a thriller that breaks all the boundaries.  It's not just a simple police procedural.  Nor is it just a horror novel.  Nor is it only a penetrating gaze into the darkness within each of us.  It's all of these things, and, amazingly, Klavan makes it work brilliantly.It starts off at a breakneck speed, with two  famous police detectives  inspecting a slaughter house -  the bloody bodies of five people strewn across a room.  A drug deal gone bad?  One small child was left alive, hidden behind a secret panel that concealed a vast stash of money.  The terrified little boy didn't see what took place, but he recalls the killers saying a mysterious two words.Zach, a police detective,  sets out to discover the meaning of the words, and it's like pulling at a thread until it unravels the sweater.  He's soon off to Germany, and hot on the trail of Stumpf's Baselard, a dagger from the 15th century that's been missing since that era.This is a fun page turner.

"Alas, a lot.First, there is the attack on reality: ""the universe is the merest illusion"" (p 14). Yet if everything we see and know is an illusion, please explain why a train smashing into a person causes damage or death, every single time.He claims ""Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference"" (p 39). No difference between being alert and awake and sleeping? Yet all I am is consciousness. Was I given a mind that reasons only to deny its capacity for judgment and instead try to empty my mind of everything, which is what Marharshi advises?Maharshi's pantheism insists I don't exist. My mind and body are illusions. And the very best, the highest thing that can happen to the illusion-that-is-me is that I should once and forever truly die, and whatever history and thought and feeling that was once me be utterly extinguished within the universal entity.It is difficult to see how this is different from the cold fact of death itself. A classic nontheist definition of death would be that I cease to exist utterly, my consciousness is gone, and what is left even of my body will be gradually subsumed into earth and worms.Contrast this with Christianity, which insists each one of us has infinite value. And that we will all continue to exist forever, long after the earth itself has vanished. And what's more, that we will exist not as an amorphous speck in a sea of amorphous specks, but will exist with all that makes us unique, including all our consciousness and memories. Christianity insists we are, each one of us, valuable.Christianity led to the belief in human rights. If all people have immortal souls, and were created by a loving God, in whose eyes we are all equal, we must treat everyone with respect.According to the Global Slavery Index published in 2014, the nation with the greatest number of slaves today is India. India tops the ranking by far with a total of 14 million slaves. May I repeat that? Fourteen million slaves.Here's Christianity: in 1434 Pope Eugene IV declared all Catholics who owned a slave excommunicated.Whereas Maharshi says ""Karma...is its cause"" and ""Karma alone is responsible"" (p 59), and again and again blames Karma for what happened. A belief in predestination and fate has crippled India for thousands of years. Millions have suffered from the heartless caste system, especially those in the lowest castes, such as the Dalits.Mother Teresa helped the poorest of the poor because India didn't. In the past few decades, Brahmins have rioted to protest any improvement in the lives of the Dalits. The Brahmins explained that the Dalits had earned their fate by a past life, so let them suffer. This sounds like a monstrous cruelty to me.Pantheism could be used to argue against human rights, as in the case of the Brahmins who rioted. It could be used to extend human rights to cows and chimps.In 2008, Hindu mobs in Orissa attacked and killed between 75 to 123 Christians, close to 5,000 houses were destroyed and at least 264 churches and prayer halls were desecrated and demolished. Today, according to testimony by Alliance Defending Freedom given before the US House of Representatives, Christians are being persecuted, sexually assaulted and attacked by mobs in India. These crimes are going unpunished.What has pantheism given to the world? One out of every three charities in this world is run by Christians. And even in India, it's the Christians who care for the lepers.Maharshi urges me to ""overcome infatuation for the body and for wife and children"" (p 169) and he scorns ""gross objects of pleasure such as garlands, sandal paste, women"" (p 169).Speaking as a woman and a mother, I find this insulting. I also find it insulting that in Hinduism merely being born a woman is considered a punishment. Hasn't one cost of pantheism been the harm it has brought to the lives of Indian women? How many women were burned to death in suttee? How many female infants have been exposed or fed dry hulls to kill them?Maharshi refers frequently to Hindu gods. But for the most part, the Hindu gods, just like the pagan Greek and Roman gods, were amoral, petty, vain, and occasionally murderous. Dwelling on their stories would never lead anyone to a moral life. Kali with her chain of human heads can be argued to be the background to the savage Thuggee cult that killed so many people.In fact, what bothers most people who study Hinduism is the absence of morality.If my Karma has fated me to kill or steal, how am I to blame? And since the pantheistic entity fates both good and evil, exactly why is stealing and murder wrong? There are no ten commandments in Hinduism, no belief in absolute evil or good.The pantheistic entity fated the Nazis to push 6 million Jews into the ovens to die. The pantheistic entity fated the Communists to slaughter 100 million human beings in the 20th century.Another tragic consequence of pantheism is indifference. If the world is an illusion why should anyone care about consequences? Pol Pot ordering that everyone over fifteen be shot to death is of no more moral weight than eating an apple.Maharshi scorns what he calls ""worldly knowledge""(p 137). This is the standard Hindu dismissal of knowledge, science, and pretty much everything that's made this century better than the year 100 BC.It is the reverse of Christianity. Christianity gave birth to the university system and real science grew out of the Christian Middle Ages. Pick up a copy of The Genesis of Science: How the Christian Middle Ages Launched the Scientific Revolution by James Hannamick for an explanation.Comment Comment | Permalink","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCN3BNOLX7LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8188018066#wasThisHelpful","R2PCN3BNOLX7LS","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was once axiomatic among western intellectuals that China would never embrace Christianity.  Centuries of missionaries had failed.  The only converts were 'rice Christians', those ""cynical souls who had frequented the missions for the benefits they provided"" (p 1).  And then came communism, and the suppression of any religion.  The few Chinese who clung to Christianity were martyred, set to prison, or persecuted. With such a background, it seemed impossible to imagine an explosion of belief.  But that is exactly what has happened.Estimates of the number of Christians in China today vary widely, from  16 million to 200 million. Some westerners have argued  China has been struck by a kind of religious fervor, and all sorts of beliefs  growing among the uneducated rural poor.  This idea was solidly debunked by statistics found by Stark and Wang, whose research clearly showed no difference at all between urban and rural belief patterns.  In fact, Christianity was growing most in the educated elite, and it was spread through family contact as well as friends.  Still, how many Chinese Christians are there?  Stark and Wang set out to discover reliable statistics on Christianity in China, and would they found is astonishing.First off, it is important to note that many Chinese people practice a folk religion, which is based on ancestral worship with some Confucianism and Buddhism thrown in, and yet will nevertheless say that they don't practice a religion.  For the Chinese, religion means an organized religion.  Even a large number of Chinese  who ""believe in Jesus Christ... (deny) that they are Christians""  (p 5), since they  aren't currently  members of any particular  congregation.  Getting exact statistics under such conditions has proven very difficult.Christianity began in China with Catholic missionaries who arrived in the 1500s.  By 1724 ""the emperor outlawed Christianity""...and in 1814 another emperor  proclaimed ""those spreading the gospel 'shall be sentenced to death'"" (p 13).  Protestant missionaries began entering China in the 1800s.  It was the Catholic church, however, that sustained the brunt of persecution, even later under the communists, ""because the Catholic church acknowledges the pope's authority"" (p 14), and perhaps also because ""in China overall, Catholics outnumbered Protestants by three to one"" (p 26).Chinese resentment of European activities led to the Boxer rebellion, and the murder of 30,000 Chinese Christians, as well as priests, nuns, and Protestant missionaries, as well as 53 children of the Protestant missionaries.  Furthermore, vast  cultural changes in the west had occurred.  ""Protestant...elite seminaries were dominated by theologians who...rejected most traditional Christian doctrines as outmoded from the standpoint of of modern science and knowledge"" (p 32) and were uncomfortable with missionary activity.Then came Mao and the communists.  In 1966 Mao began the decade of the brutal cultural revolution, which attacked anything foreign.  ""Ironically, the persecution of Protestants may have been the single most beneficial event for the success of Christianity"" (p 43-44), turning the movement into one that had become entirely Chinese.  ""The continuing growth of Christianity in China during the years of the Cultural Revolution was truly an underground activity"" (p p 50) which spread from person to person and through family contacts.Meanwhile, Catholics were severely persecuted.  About 4,000 schools were Catholic, and all were closed, as well as hospitals and orphanages and printing presses.  Many priests and bishops were killed.  ""By 1954 three hundred Chinese priests were in prison...and then...there was a mass arrest of more than two hundred clergy"" (p 53) and Catholics.One interesting fact noted is that persecution has had an immense impact on the growth of Christianity in China, but only among the most traditional forms of Christianity.  Protestants ""are almost uniformly members of extremely conservative and intense congregations.  Why?  ...Lukewarm liberalism simply could not generate the level of commitment needed to hold onto one""s faith in the fact of considerable personal risk"" (p 72).Another surprise is that among the Chinese, it is the more educated who are interested in Christianity.  It is on Chinese college campuses that one hears the argument that ""'we have realized that the heart of your culture is your religion: Christianity.  That is why the West is so powerful.  the Christian moral foundation...was what made possible the emergence of capitalism and then...democratic politics'"" (p 82).Stark and Wang conclude that by 2007 there were some 60 million Christians in China, which was equal to the number of people who were members of the communist party.  If this rate of growth continues for the next fifteen years ""there will be 294.6 million Chinese Christians"" (p 114) by only 2030.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQDKURTQ1YJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599474875#wasThisHelpful","R2MQDKURTQ1YJ6","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book by  Jeremias  is famous and has proved  influential for decades.  Really, this is  the place to start when investigating early Christianity and the Eucharist.The book was first published in English in 1955, and it is utterly exhaustive.  Jeremias argues persuasively  that the words spoken by Jesus were reliably conveyed to the early church and reported faithfully by Paul and the gospel writers.There had been types of Eucharist in Judaism, but the Eucharist begun by Christ was not merely a Passover meal, and would be memorialized constantly by the early Christians, not only at Passover, and not only in a small  family group, but by a new kind of family - those who accepted Christ.Although earlier scholars had argued against the Eucharist being a memorial, Jeremias digs into the Old Testament to locate numerous earlier memorials.  For example, the cereal offering of Lev. 2.2 is a memorial.  Also the shewbread is a clear memorial and obvious type of the Eucharist.  He finds that the 'fruit of the vine' does refer back to the first cup of Passover.""Already in the first century AD we can trace the eschatological interpretation of the unleavened bread; on it God had miraculously fed Israel during their journey through the desert...It is no accident that in the New Testament the unleavened loaves are also eschatologically interpreted: (p 59). For Second Temple Jews  ""wine was drunk at festive occasions...when entertaining guests...family celebrations...circumcisions...marriage"" (p 50).Jeremias tackled the greatest objection many scholars have to the reliability of the transmission of the Eucharist to early Christians, that of John's gospel.  He points out that ""The fact that John depicts here the same meal as that described in Mark...is shown by the betrayal scene...as well as by the ensuing walk to Gethsemane.  Some of the remarks made by John presuppose that this was a passover meal...the Last Supper was held at an unusual hour....Jesus celebrated this meal with the closest circle of his disciples....a ceremonial meal...reclining at table""  (p 81).The information about the Eucharist has been conveyed reliably can also be seen in ""I Cor 11:23-25 Paul...quotes the words: 'For I received of the Lord what I also delivered to you...'to receive'...'to deliver' ..represent the rabbinical technical terms kibbel min and masar le....the chain of tradition goes back unbroken to Jesus himself: (p 101).Proof of the fact that the early Christians believed the Eucharist to be sacred can be found in Hippolytus of Rome when he wrote about the Eucharist ""'He shall not tell this to any but the faithful'"" (p 136).  More proof:  ""an enigmatic manner of speaking about the Lord's Supper to the Acts of the Apostles (pseudonyms for the Eucharist), to Hebrews (reservation of Eucharistic teaching to the 'mature'), to the Didache (silence about Eucharistic procedure), then to the shorter text of Luke (limitation to the first words of the formula), and to the symbolic representation of the Eucharist in the Abercius inscription, and finally top the secrecy imposed upon the whole baptismal and Eucharistic procedure by Hippolytus"" (p 136).One book you must have in your library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6I9E4EGMEE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0334004144#wasThisHelpful","R1F6I9E4EGMEE5","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Merdinger's book is crisply written, and always interesting.  Although her viewpoint is Protestant, I found her quite evenhanded.With the arrival of Constantine, it appeared  the  persecutions had finally stopped.  But that certainly didn't mean Christianity could expect five minutes of peace.  Oh no.  Instead, heresies, schisms and problem clergy spouted up like weeds.  Theological questions vexed bishops, who in turn vexed Rome with solving them.  In  North Africa  the most pressing question at first was what should be done with the  traditors (those who had handed over sacred scripture under the threat of persecution).Augustine spent 40 years fighting  unceasingly against an unending flood of heresies - Manicheans, Novatians, Donatists, Arians, and Pelagians.  Above all, like Cyprian, Augustine strove for unity in the church, but never by accepting or pasting over differences.  He attended synod after synod,  ruled on ecclesiastical conundrums,  visited Rome time and again to discuss problem clergy and theological matters, and, let us not forget, led a monastery.  Oh, and did I forget to mention his writing?Augustine lived in one of of the most vital parts of the empire, with  Hippo a flourishing seaport.  ""Africa was the breadbasket of the West; if the flow of grain and oil were impeded because of civil tumult, famine would stalk the streets of Rome"" (p 18).  After 410, when Rome was sacked, refugees streamed into the area, hoping for sanctuary from the chaos that was Rome.I especially enjoyed Merdinger's  description of the problems Augustine had with clergy.  In an area that was once firmly in the Donatist clutches, it was difficult to find well versed, solidly trained  Catholic priests to oversee areas.  That is the explanation for Apiarius, who turned out to be a disaster  as clergy, a man who defrauded his flock shamelessly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRYG2QKET6FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300105282#wasThisHelpful","RDRYG2QKET6FG","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the problem:  ""Study after study...indicates conclusively that no other family structure produces such consistently positive outcomes as the married couple"" (p 117).What will be the consequences now that  a majority of women under 30 are not married to their father of their children? Yes, a majority.Yet we've spent the last 50 years tossing marriage out the window.  The social repercussions are terrifying. It's causing a growing class divide, with the children raised by their married genetic parents going to and graduating from college, and forming an elite, prosperous class. The bottom half of the divide are the marriage losers: women who never married or who are divorced. Their children, especially the boys, research shows, are losers in life.They grow up in chaotic households. They do poorly in school, and drop out too frequently. They have emotional problems, which, tragically, continue throughout their lives. They suffer in greatly disproportional numbers from drug abuse, alcohol abuse, promiscuity, lack of motivation, and failure in school and later in the job market. They commit suicide in far greater numbers than the happy upper class children of married parents. Over 80% of our prison population comes from this class. And, in catastrophic numbers compared to the era before 1950. they suffer more from being sexually and physically and emotionally abused.The lower class has swallowed the enticing bait of what Crouse calls ""the individualistic conception of marriage...marriage has gone from a  sacred covenant with a legally binding contract...to a 'contract' that is more easily terminated...than most other contracts"" (p 7).Irregardless of the cause, what can be done to help single mothers and to aid their children? We have fifty years of research suggesting very little helps. As Crouse points out ""We have spent more than $10,000 per child in the nation's public school programs (more than some top-quality privater schools and we continue to spend 7.4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product to education the nation's children (p 146). Huge, massively funded government programs like Head Start have produced little, if any, positive results.If we can't figure out a way to halt the trajectory that the majority of these children are on, what will this mean for our future?  And what does it mean for these children?Nor is marriage evaporating before our eyes in only  America.  Fewer and fewer people are marrying in Europe, while divorce and single parenthood have soared.Europe and Asia have a new class of people those who embrace voluntary childlessness.  Europe’s most rapidly growing family type is the one-person household.  In Denmark the number of single person households exceeds 45%.  That's practically half the population.  Living alone.Childlessness is on the rise in Asian nations as well, especially in Japan,  South Korea and  Singapore, and even China.We have veered onto an unknown path, without a map to guide us.  No way to tell what the future will be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U14U5RBI6ZS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1412846072#wasThisHelpful","R3U14U5RBI6ZS7","A3DIGM3KB4E11V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DIGM3KB4E11V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly, I think this is better than WEN, mostly because it's cheaper, not as strong of a smell, and it's still got a lightweight texture that isn't overly conditioning.  I have found, however, that you REALLY have to spend the time to rinse well.  Basically, rinse with cooler water until your hair doesn't feel slippery anymore.  That's when you've got it all out.  I would say it's about 2-3 times longer to rinse this versus Wen, but if you do, you'll like it just as much.

"I was not lucky enough to get an arc but downloaded the audio book as soon as it came out.  What happened next was the best two days of life (hah well two of them ☺)! Marissa Meyer is a fantastic author and I can’t wait to see what she writes next!I will say that a lot happens in this book, A LOT, which means that at time readers and the characters don’t have a chance to breathe.  Even during the slow moments there were other things going on with other characters. I’m not sure if reading would be different, but the audio version flowed very smoothly and even though there was a lot going on, Rebecca Soler just made everything perfect and the pacing worked.With 800 pages, and a lot of threads and plots to tie up I will say that someone will be disappointed, meaning there are close calls, and even closer rescues.  Each character will be put in immediate danger, but they make it out… I don’t consider that a spoiler it’s a YA HEA! It worked for me though.  I know some reviewers get angry about it not being realistic or wanting to have more pain and what not but this is a nice middle ground between Breaking Dawn and Allegiant.  Think about it.On a side note during an interview at the end of Winter the audiobook Marissa Meyer says that she’s writing another side story two years later and there’s a wedding.

"Richelle Mead has given readers amazing series like Vampire Academy, Bloodlines and Age of X. Soundless is her latest release, and the cover is gorgeous! Soundless has Chinese folklore, a strong heroine and really interesting fantastical abilities. Richelle has stopped by HEA to talk about Soundless and heroine Fei.Jessie: Welcome to HEA, Richelle! Kim Mai Guest is your audiobook narrator and did an amazing job. Is her voice what you imagined for Fei?Richelle: I actually got to listen to samples of potential narrators for Soundless and was able to choose her for Fei. She had the right vibe and tone for the character, so I feel really lucky that she was available! I never listen to my audiobooks in their entirety (it’s too strange for me!), but my husband’s been listening to it in his car, and he’s totally hooked by the amazing job she’s been doing.Jessie: I can’t wait to listen to the entire book! So how did you decide on Chinese folklore?Richelle: Fantasy books in Western culture are often heavily inspired by European culture — and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what I grew up on, and I love it. But there’s so much potential out there in the rest of the world — an amazing wealth of culture and mythology that we often miss. I really wanted to tap into that. There are thousands of years of Chinese history that are full of rich and wonderful details that most people in the U.S. don’t even know about. I really only scratched the surface of it all in the world I created for Soundless, and I hope readers will be inspired to explore more about that region.Jessie: I completely agree!

I didn’t think the cover of A Thousand Pieces of You could be topped, but I guess I was wrong.What do you think of your awesome narrator, Tavia Gilbert?Claudia: Tavia is AMAZING. She has to pull off not only so many different characters, but different versions of each, with different accents! She’s the Tatiana Maslany (of the TV show Orphan Black) of audiobooks.You wrote the settings beautifully! How did you reimagine all of the cities and dimensions?Claudia: The worlds are a combination of what’s familiar (I used to live in NYC) and what’s sensationally fun to imagine (fin de siècle Paris).

"INTERVIEW WITH MAYA BANKSWe finally get Hancock’s story! What can readers expect?Maya: I had to wait TEN books to write a story that has literally burned a hole in my head for YEARS, lol. The very FIRST story that began the KGI series and that formed the entire basis for the series had been with me MUCH longer than that. I want to say I had the idea somewhere around 2001-2002 back when I was just starting to get the nerve up to actually write as a career and no longer something I only did for MY entertainment.But as with all good things, I had to wait for the right moment *sigh* and I didn’t get the opportunity to pitch the KGI series to my editor until 2009 and I was SO excited to FINALLY get to be able to tell Ethan and Rachel’s story and let loose all the members of KGI, the brothers, team members and yes, even the “foes.”Expect a lot of emotion. Angst. Betrayal. But most of all, how the power of love can heal even the deepest, most mortal wounds.Hancock’s story is special but then I’ve always known he’s a special man and it would take a very stubborn, determined woman to break through the armor that has become as natural as breathing for Hancock to wear, an essential, protective defense mechanism that until now, until Honor, has never crumbled — just as he has — into mere dust, leaving him as vulnerable and unprotected as a newborn baby. And only one woman, with the soul of a warrior and the light and compassion of an angel can possibly ever put him back together again.What makes this heroine so special? (That she fit Hancock and got our legend?)*Head over to the HEA Blog to read the rest of Maya's Interview**INTERVIEW WITH TAD BRANSONWhat was your favorite scene in Darkest Before Dawn?Tad: There are so many terrific scenes in the book and I don’t want to give too much away, but I will say that the first half is filled with so much tension that it feels like an elephant is sitting on your chest. There were some occasions when I got so wrapped up in telling the story that my director had to ask me to slow down the pace. Which is always a good sign, when you can’t wait to get to what happens next.What was your favorite character to narrate?Tad: Obviously the hero and heroine of the book, Hancock and Honor, were the ones I spent the most time with and the ones I became most attached to. But I do have to say that I developed a soft spot for a character called “Mojo,” who is pretty much monosyllabic through the whole book, but who is so clearly drawn that you can’t help but love the guy. I think readers and listeners of the audiobook will see why.Any fun or interesting things happen while narrating Darkest Before Dawn?Tad: Something kind of amazing happened when the recording was complete. Or I should say “didn’t happen.” I didn’t have to go back in and do any extra recording for “pickups.” (Things I missed or misspoke the first time around.) Usually after the editing process there’s always at least one or two things that need to be cleaned up, and for the first time ever I had none!

Well it sums up how feel good and happy reading DD I was.  I’m not saying it’s fluffy or too light, but there was this vibe of small town charm, I could feel the characters’ personalities coming out of my kindle and it was great!I won’t rehash the plot, but the part that really shines in this book (hopefully series…!)  are the characters.  There’s so many of them and none of them fade into the backdrop of the world building or get confused with other characters.  Each have a life of their own and it made it impossible to leave Holly Creek even after the last page.  I found that I wanted to see more of Jake, Zane, Clover, and so so many others.

"Why you should read it: I haven’t read many historical YAs and love these genre crossovers. Samantha is a really great heroine who is smart and the perfect spy.

The mystery of who Velvet is kept me guessing, and come on, who doesn’t love an elite all-woman spy group?INTERVIEW WITH TERI BROWNI loved the women’s spy group. If you ran one, where would you send your spies?Teri: In Portland, Oregon, we have an ice cream shop called Salt & Straw that has the craziest ice cream flavors known to man — honey and lavender, roasted cherry and bone marrow, blackberry and goat cheese with habanera — things like that. And they all work. Their ice cream is nationally known and so incredibly dreamy delicious. Every month they temporarily unleash a set of new flavors on the world. Yes, that is where I would send a spy — to uncover  all their secret recipes and find out what they were working on ahead of time. You’re welcome, world.

"Why you should read it: This book isn’t for everyone, or rather the writing style won’t be. It’s very different from anything I’ve read, and I have to say I enjoyed the e-mails, AI, transcripts and different forms of communications. It almost made the book feel more alive, more time sensitive and exciting. You have to be in the mood for this space opera because there were awesome pictures, diagrams and there’s a lot going on! It’s a new type of read and one I’m so glad I experienced … so is there another book? What’s next?INTERVIEW WITH AMIE AND JAYHow was writing together? You two write so differently!Jay: Amazing fun. Amie and I have different styles and different thought processes (I tend to lean quite dark, and she’s usually the Queen of Rainbows and Pixie Dust), which means we’re constantly pushing each other into new territory. You tend to find the best in yourself as an artist when you’re challenged. But underneath it all, we’re both huge nerds with a love of sci-fi, and honestly, writing Illuminae was a blast. Best fun I’ve ever had with my clothes on.Amie: We have SO much fun. Jay’s right that having different strengths means you lead each other places you might never go alone — whether that’s delving into a very dark place for a character, lingering in a deeply personal moment or putting a twist or a punch line on a scene you’d never have thought up. Writing together means you’re never on your own when you hit an obstacle, and so often what the two of you bring together ends up being more than the sum of its parts.This was a very different book to read. How was setting up the different forms and such?Amie: It flowed a lot more easily than you might imagine. Illuminae’s made up completely of documents put together by a group of hackers — so it’s all e-mails, IMs, security reports, video transcript, schematics, movie posters, comic strips and the meanderings of a mad artificial intelligence. For each piece of the narrative, we’d consider a bunch of different options, and ask what they’d bring us — whose POV did we want to be in? Who knew what at this stage? Did we need to provide information, or an insight into someone’s personality or state of mind? How would the reader most easily digest what we were saying? The variety was heaps of fun to write, as well. One day you’d be a pompous IT guy, the next a frat-boy Marine.Jay: I’m usually a pantser when it comes to writing, so this was the first time I’d done such intensive mapping, but you can’t co-author without a roadmap or you end up in two different states. We became the masters of GoogleDoc Fu. Lots of spreadsheets tracking death tolls and distance traveled and whatnot. The design process came afterward — it really began in earnest after the manuscript was complete. It was important to us that the story came first, and the design second. We wanted the alt format to augment the reader experience, but never be a crutch.For more of the interview head over to the HEA blog!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVB6HT16Y1NVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553499114#wasThisHelpful","RVB6HT16Y1NVG","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why you should read it: This was a strange and enjoyable read. I say strange because the narrative and style of writing are very unique. I enjoyed the anonymous characters as well as the brilliant setting. I know there are a few retellings out there, but I don’t think you can really compare. If you have time for a slow build, if you’re a fan of detail and prose, this is absolutely the story for you. I think this would be really interesting as an audiobook! Can I recommend Emma Galvin and her smoky voice?INTERVIEW WITH E.K. JOHNSTONI loved the anonymity with everyone. How/why did you choose to do that?E.K.: I never really think of them as anonymous! Each character has a name from every person who loves them (which is why the king only has “the king,” for example). In my head, the narrator calls her sister “my SISTER,” and her sister says “MY sister,” and the difference in their inflection gives a completely distinguishable word. I suppose from a practical standpoint I went with honorifics because Middle Bronze Age names are difficult to extrapolate, but I loved getting to “translate” most of the names into English. It’s the opposite of how we usually name characters (my name, for example, is Greek for “pure,” and no one’s ever called me that).What are you currently working on?E.K.: I’m just about to dive into revisions for the Nights companion novel, actually.

It was my favorite scene to read, to perform, and to talk with friends and family about afterward.  It’s a fictional conversation that resonates in the real world.Do you have a favorite character?James: My favorite character is Mike’s mom, Mrs. Mitchell.  She has all of these competing ambitions in her life: her quest for political power, keeping her severely alcoholic husband in line and raising three children pretty much on her own. Her plate is full. I sympathized with Mike’s frustration with her and how she seems to always put her career first despite her family desperately needing her, but that only makes it more compelling when we get glimpses of her inner life.

I would love to read his headspace, and what he thinks about. I also love that we get to see more of the Marshalls, that is one thing that Mary Calmes excels at.  Her characters live in a real world that has other things going on in it besides the romance.  It keeps her stories, interesting and adds spice to the characters’ lives.What I loved about this book was the romance, the mystery and the crazy serial killing doctor (give him back his rib!).  It was eerie and dark at times and my god she puts Miro through the wringer physically and mentally.  There are excellent twists, turns and a lot of action and violence.  It’s exactly what I would want/expect when thinking about a Marshall/cop/etc book.There was a lot of clothing detailing though one could argue that it is in Miro’s personality to notice and talk about it.  I can see why some would get annoyed, but for me it just added to the people wearing the clothes/shoes/coats as well as gave a bit of description as to what the person looked like.  I was really really sad at the fall out between Ian and his father, I did not expect it, but really it was probably in the cards for Ian since his dad left.I won’t go into details about the plot, I really don’t want to ruin it, but the villain is mega creepy and again I would have loved to see what Ian was doing while Miro was being strung up like a piece of meat.  Mary’s books are evolving, I like it when she gets darker (Mine is still my all time favorite) and I hope there are many more Marshall books in the future, or at least in that world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0TX1K473572/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014V4EDHQ#wasThisHelpful","RX0TX1K473572","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now, we have Something to Prove by Kimberly Lang. In this contemporary, we have Ryan Tanner (super hot) and Helena (former wild girl) getting together after years apart, and it's adorable.

"Why you should read it: Carrie Ryan had me with The Forest of Hands and Teeth. Her gritty (hah, overused word, I know) characters and horrible events just dragged something out of me. Daughter of Deep Silence is just as crazy and emotional. Just watching/reading Libby/Frances and her falling or refalling for Gray was intense. I was right there with her: I didn't know if I wanted her to spill everything to Gray, or hold him at arm's length. And that ending? Hope wrapped in secrets. I like that this isn't a love triangle (I thought it was between Shepherd and Gray), but it's twisted relationships. While romance isn't the driving force, the connection between Gray and Frances, even after everything, is palpable. I don't think even Gray realized that while he was falling for ""Libby,"" his subconscious knew who she was, just like Shepherd also knew who she wasn't. If you're looking for a dark and very intense read, pick up any of Carrie Ryan's books, but especially this one.

"Why you should read it: This has been the month of awesome YAs, and Hold Me Like a Breath is a good one! Penelope is such an interesting heroine. She's not normal and has a terrible disease that doesn't allow her to live her life the way she wants or longs for. She's this dichotomy of caution and risk. I loved reading about her fantasies, her hopes and, of course, her family. Pen's love interests are also beautiful in their own way. Both Char and Garrett light up Pen in different ways, and hopefully in the next book we'll be get some more nice moments alone and some more sizzle.

"Why you should read it: This book is crazy. It made me feel like I was the one imprisoned. I was right there alongside Cora, thinking other people were spies, falling for Lucky, feeling betrayed by Lucky, falling for Cassian, and the enclosure! At first I thought the book was a bit shallow. We had the stereotypical strong heroine, the good guy with a secret, the genius nerd, the beautiful manipulating girl, the strong slight bully and then the alien who seemed to reach inside of Cora. I was like, Ah, I get it, I know what's going to happen. But the story is interesting enough that I kept reading because I enjoyed it, and then, Bam! The last fourth of the book throws off everything — I mean, everything. I didn't see any of it coming, not where each person ends up, not how Cora ends up, and I really like Cassian, though I'm probably alone (I always choose the wrong guy). Now I want the next book in the series ASAP and have to wait another year. This is definitely a recommend. It's a great start to, hopefully, a continuation of the excitement and craziness Megan leaves readers and Cora with.

"Why you should read it: I couldn't believe that Penryn and Raffe's story was coming to an end, though I also was extremely excited to see how pieces would fall. This conclusion is crazy. There is so much going on, and I felt like I flew through the book. Penryn and Raffe are trying to find a doctor who can fix Raffe's wings, and to see Paige. Raffe loves Penryn, but will he take her side fully against the angels? His own kind? The scenes between the two lovebirds are emotionally charged and really hot. There are so few scenes with just them that I cherished each one. The book could have been broken up into two books instead of one. The last part felt rushed, and while everything is wrapped up nicely, I did find myself wanting more. I know it was originally slated for five books, but I don't know why it was cut down to three.

"Why you should read it: I have loved the Elder Races series since Pia and Dragos (on audio and page) and was super excited to read about Julian the Nightkind king! Julian is a favorite hero in earlier books because he comes across as alpha and very hot (not as hot as Dragos, but come on … Dragos is a dragon!). I loved seeing Julian rule the Nightkind and, really, he has some amazing chemistry with Melisande (still can't call her Melly). Now some readers may not enjoy Melisande and Julian's action-filled captivity because … well … they were very, very horny, even when the evil villain was chasing them down. The two lovebirds seriously threw steam off my Kindle. Julian has issues communicating properly, though that could be him being an alpha and over a millennia old. All in all, this is a solid installment for the Elders.

When I heard that Melissa was writing the prequel to Descendants, a Disney Channel Original Movie coming out in spring 2015, I knew I had to get my hands on this. I loved reading all the references, though it can get a bit busy. The characters are by far some of the best, and the majority of the first half of the book is introducing them and getting the readers invested in all these ""villains."" While some may feel this is perfect for younger kids, I had a ball reading it and can't wait to see what's in store next, maybe a little more romance, a little more plotting and of course all those villains!

"Why you should read it: I'm not usually a big teen contemporary reader, but Kasie West always sucks me in and has me cheering for her awesome heroes and heroines. I love that heroine Gia is a typical girl in high school. She has a college boyfriend, a frenemy, a best friend and worries about getting into college and, of course, how her friends perceive her. I did feel her frenemy was a bit too focused on ""destroying"" Gia, but readers are given hints of a deeper and darker reason behind the girl's animosity, which makes it more believable. Gia's character arc also grows perfectly and transforms her into something much more than a shallow girl. Now, let's talk about the hero … Hayden is great, a bit nerdy, a whole lot of sweet, and interested in helping this random girl. I loved reading about him and watching Gia slowly fall for him and Hayden for her. If you're in the mood for a light and enjoyable read (with a bit of angst … this is high school), then The Fill-In Boyfriend is the perfect one to pick up.

"Why you should read it: For anyone who hasn't yet, you need to read Try, the first installment in the Temptation series. It will blow your mind! Tate and Logan are fantastic together, and the trilogy has arced perfectly for readers. Try was super hot (really hot), but it didn't have as much emotion in it as I wanted. Take, on the other hand, showed Logan and Tate's struggle within themselves and their relationship perfectly while still managing to be super steamy. Then came Trust. This book has the perfect mixture of hot steamy bedroom scenes and hard angsty perfection. I love that we get to see each hero through both Logan's and Tate's POV. This allows readers to really understand and connect with both heroes and really ""feel"" their struggles and fears. Though Ella says Trust is the final installment, I hope we'll see more of Tate and Logan, even if it's a cameo in another series. I'm not ready to see their banter, their flirtations and their chemistry come to a close!

"HEA chats with Katherine Kellgren about A Desperate Fortune.  I've listened to Katherine's narrations of Her Royal Spyness by Rhys Bowen, Dracula by Bram Stoker and, one of my faves, The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan. Katherine is always spot-on in her narrations and characterizations. Listeners will feel completely drawn in to the story and hold their breath as they feel completely immersed in the world.A Desperate Fortune is a dual story with two timelines. I loved the historical timeline. The narrator of the diary held my attention as I delved into France in the 1700s. While the story started out slowly, by the end I was racing alongside the heroines.

"When The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty came out in 1999, readers were drawn to this darkly erotic and vivid world of submission and slavery. I read the trilogy myself when I was young and … probably not supposed to read that mature of a book series, but it interested me. Years later, when I re-read the series as an adult, I understood the draw to Beauty's world, but at the same time was a bit troubled about how old Beauty was and how everything was extremely non-consensual. When I heard that Beauty's Kingdom was coming out, I was curious as to what other part of the story needed to be told, but I really enjoyed reading Beauty's Kingdom. The language is very similar to that in the first three books, but Beauty made the changes I wished were in the first book. The slaves had to volunteer (and be of age!). This ultimately changed the entire tone of the book for me. Instead of the secret terrifying trysts between the slaves, there was recreation time and, oh my, the lead pony? No longer did I feel guilt reading about the stables, but rather contentedness that all the ponies wanted, really wanted, and volunteered to be there.There will be some readers who may be disappointed with the change of tone in the story, and of course, the language won't be for everyone. I personally loved the volunteering and all of Beauty's ideas. This is a highly erotic book, like every-page erotic. Come into Beauty's Kingdom with the knowledge that there are slaves, ponies, puppies, kittens and a whole lot of open loving between everyone … oh, and whips, paddles, turntables and harnesses.Head over to the HEA blog to read the interview with Anne Rice!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWHLZTQDKGTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427996#wasThisHelpful","R1MWHLZTQDKGTZ","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why you should read it: I loved Dorothy Must Die. It was a new concept, and seeing Oz with all my favorite characters being evil was unique! In this sequel we still see Amy ""reacting,"" though she continues to get stronger and stronger. We get to see her and Nox (Nox fans will love!), and we get to see more sides of her. I love that Amy is fighting/embracing being good vs. being wicked. Especially since in Oz everything is gray, and what is good can be wicked and the other way around. I have to say that the best (worst?) part of this series is the creep factor of the ""good"" guys. The Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow (shudder) really make this series. Things are only worse in The Wicked Will Rise. Readers will shudder, cringe and pump their fists with Amy as she discovers what she's capable of.

"Why you should read it: Readers are going to be on one side of the fence or the other with this one. On one hand, it reads more like an urban fantasy. Readers will get action, violence and more deeply involved with the Chosen, the Shadows and, of course, the brothers of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. It's always a treat to see my favorite characters pop up, and this was no different. We get to really see into the Shadows' world, and I liked that hidden part. On the other side, there are things that happen in this book that readers won't be happy with. Like, at all. There are some funny scenes (with Rhage), but overall, it's a very emotional book. The story does feel pulled in a lot of directions, and there are a lot of characters and subplots, and readers are left hanging at the end.

"Why you should read it: I always love Shelly's books (and I just pre-ordered this on Audible), and like most of her books, readers (and our heroine) get thrown in the middle of chaos. It honestly took me a couple chapters to really get a feel for what was going on, but what I did know was that I loved the Crows. Poor Kera. She's a mega-organized Marine who gets dropped into a group of unorganized, crazy assassins. There's a bunch of mythology to keep straight, a hot Raven and one ex-sociopath (whom I love). I was laughing, giggling and sighing the whole book and really hope Shelly continues the series. There are so many avenues open for future books. For Shelly fans, this is a butt-kicking phenomenally funny book. For readers looking for something a bit different from the typical paranormal fare, this is the start of a new series and well worth the read.

"Why you should read it: This was an interesting book in that's a bit of dystopia and a bit of predetermination. I loved that readers got a close look at the life of privilege along with the life of a blank and their two interwoven paths.

I think Ash is a strong-enough first installment to get readers hooked and wanting to know what will happen with Dax and Madden and the guys. I do hope that a few questions will be addressed: I didn't buy into the randomness of fate being a chain reaction. I wanted more info on what Madden's mom wrote and, finally, more about the Destiny system: where exactly it came from and what exactly the process entails. Overall, though, the main characters are awesome to watch in their growth, and the ending has me ticked that I have to wait another year for the sequel.

"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is … and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection.

"Why you should read it: I have to admit that I had no idea about the YouTube channel (hey, I read, not watch), but Sunshine is adorable and very funny. The book reads a bit younger than my typical YA fare, but it was still enjoyable, and that cover is gorgeous! Sunshine's character has this weird light vibe around her. It's like reading about your favorite younger cousin or your slightly awkward best friend. You're rooting for her the entire time and just want her to get to the bottom of it all. Nolan is also a great hero. He's the only one who believes her, and it was so so funny yet sweet watching them bond. I have to say, too, there aren't that many books that scare me, and while this isn't as terrifying as some of the zombie horror books I've read, there were definitely some scenes that had my ick factor way up.

"Why you should read it: This is the third Bristol Collection book, and I love the enemies-to-lovers formula. You can tell the tip of hatred and loathing hides the iceberg of chemistry and attraction. I will warn that some readers won't like this because Grant is, well, a cheater from the last book, and readers get a front seat to his divorce with his wife (whom he cheated on). So if you're a reader looking for more comforting tender moments, this may not be for you. For readers looking for the sharper edge of steam, of a cutting spark of attraction, you'll really enjoy the back and forth between Dare and Grant. I mean, for readers of the previous books, Grant was pretty hard to like, yet he was intriguing, so I'm glad we got to see behind his mask and he got his own HEA.To how much fun Josephine had writing her two heroes head over to the HEA blog!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H67EO264NY77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161922920X#wasThisHelpful","R1H67EO264NY77","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why you should read it: Nalini is gifted with writing hot alpha heroes … be they leopards, wolves or wolves in business suits. Rock Hard is the second book in her Rock Kiss series, and I have to say I love Gabriel. He's hot, he's hard and my goodness, that cover! This is by far my favorite book in this series. I mean, how could it not be when our heroine throws a stapler at Gabriel when she thought he was an intruder? Nalini is in my top three authors of all time and she delivers with Rock Hard. The romance is adorable, the characters fully developed and the steam? Perfect. Charlotte's character also had me wrapped up. She's so mousy, so shy, and her past? It kills me. That makes Gabriel's every tender moment that much sweeter and more perfect. Readers be warned, though, that there is abuse in Charlotte's past, though a lot is healed.

"This is the sequel to Blue Days and it was fun to go back to Mangrove.  I have to say what my favorite part about these books is the lack of instalove.  Each of the couples had a past and a history.  This one was very sweet. Both Cos and Kelly served and neither one came out the other side perfect. Cos came back without an arm and Kelly mentally and physically had to bring him back from the brink. Now they are both at Mangrove, Kelly is a landscaper-ish and Cos is now a cop. Kelly has also been pining after his best friend and quasi brother for years. It's just going to take a pushWe get to see Takeo and Dwyer again, which is fun :) and I love how much Takeo seems to be settling in his happy new life.What I loved about this book was the friends to lover part.  It helped give an air of history while having the characters still be new and fresh to readers.  I honestly didn’t know if Cos was going to be the love interest or the man who led Kelly on, I mean this is Mary so it could have gone either way!  But I knew KNEW it was meant to be when Kelly and Cos finally combusted together.  The smexy parts were so hot, so filled with heat, steam and just raw passion that I was fanning myself with my kindle.  My only complaint was that I wanted more of a villain, the misunderstanding made this story a lighter happy read (which some readers will adore).  I will admit though that the Mangrove series is on the bright and happy side so if you’re looking for a rainy day read this is perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFCTI4KP6WSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T512KQW#wasThisHelpful","R1KFCTI4KP6WSO","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why you should read it: This idea was just so fresh and interesting I wanted to read it the moment I saw it on Goodreads! In Alina's world, reincarnated souls can be tracked … and their reincarnates can be imprisoned for past crimes. Alina is good … but was June all bad? Is it right to decide on a person's fate based on crimes in a past life that they know nothing about? These questions are paired perfectly with the adventurous fast pacing of the book. I liked both Alina and June (yeah, yeah, they're the same-ish), and the puzzle June sent her reincarnate on was so much fun to read. The secondary characters also made the book. The teens who are trying to break Alina out? Liam, June's passionate love? They all add something deeper to the story. I did want to see more romance, maybe make it a driving force, but this is great for those who just like the slight spice of romance in a sci-fi adventure plot.

"Why you should read it: I have been waiting for this book since I finished listening to Alienated. I loved the story and really loved Cara and Aelyx's relationship. This time, though, Cara is on L'eihr, and it's a huge adjustment. I was so glad Melissa gave us an entire book on Aelyx's planet because their customs and colors are intriguing. Cara is like this breath of fresh air, or maybe a bright painting, too loud but also beautiful. I missed the couple being together as much as they had been, but watching each grow was necessary. Cara has this air about her now that allows her to move through this alien world with grace, and Aelyx is trying so hard to get the humans to agree to an alliance they don't realize how badly they need. We get to meet new characters, and there's never a dull moment. There is a lot going on beneath the surface of what I described, but to go any further would ruin the secrets and hidden plot threads.

"Why you should read it: This is such a good romance. I don't think I'm giving away any spoilers, since it happens pretty early on, but I love that this hero is trans. I will say, though, that it's a true m/m on the psychological front but not on the anatomical front, in case you're looking for strict m/m. For readers looking for love on the entire LGBTQ spectrum, it's a really good read! My favorite is, of course, Ginsburg. Everything is seen with a silver lining, and his day job as a Hollywood stuntman is just so cool. Derrick (our other hero) has a lot going on in his head. He likes Ginsburg and is attracted to him, while still worried about feeling like people think Derrick's girly or doing girly things.

"Why you should read it: This is the first book in Lexi's new Hunter series and the sixth book in her Thieves series. And Kelsey is awesome! She is a very smart, sassy and strong heroine who is between a sexy half-demon and a steamy vampire. I'm team ménage, but really it's a great love triangle. There is so much suspense and action that I can't wait for the next Hunter series … also, because it ends on a dang cliffhanger! Lexi Blake writes excellent ménage books as Sophie Oak, which means that there is no lack of steam in Ripper.

"Why you should read it: Fairest … wow! The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite YA series, and I was so excited to read about Levana. Would I cry with her? Would I feel pity? The answer for me at least was no, which did not detract from this story at all. I thought Levana was a selfish and spoiled brat, not as evil as her sister Channary (at first) but still spoiled and selfish. I mean, what she did to her true love, Evret? *shakes head*Having said that, I enjoyed every part of it. She was no heroine. Even in the beginning, when she's alone, she has evil thoughts. I absolutely adored that it's hard to like her. It was such a breath of fresh air to be so engrossed with a villain, even though you can't help but feel something for her. I love, love, love this installment. I felt for her a bit with Evret, though I felt even more so for him … And Winter! Gah! I won't say any more for fear of spoilers, but I will say that everything started forming together, everything weaved together, and it makes me that much more excited for Winter, coming in November.

"Why you should read it: I'm fascinated with the idea behind When … I mean, would it be better or worse to know when you're going to die? Not just the exact year, but the exact date? Maddie is a very realistic and relatable heroine. I felt for her, for her home life, her social life and especially when she's one of the lead suspects in a homicide of the boy she told a death date to. There's so much backstory that she feels complete, and I was right beside her as she fought the injustice of having the finger pointed at her and the struggles of just being innocent. The mystery/thriller aspect of the story is superb as well. I was just so sure the murderer was one of three people, and I was wrong on all accounts. The murderer is believable, though, and while I won't spoil it, it does raise questions about ethics that just blew me away. The romance is very much on the backburner and is just hinted at. The sweetest thing by far, though, was reading the dedication and then the last page. It melted my heart. If you're looking for a really fast-paced thriller with a hint of sweetness and a perfect heroine, I'd pick up When.To see what Victoria has to say about death dates head over to the HEA blog!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317SBT9WDNJ4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJZYI2S#wasThisHelpful","R317SBT9WDNJ4L","A3ABPSWQZDPHI7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ABPSWQZDPHI7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why you should read it: This is such a fun, wild read. I honestly had no idea what to expect. It sounded like it was a bit high fashion, a bit National Treasure and a bit forbidden romance. What it ended up being was crazy — in a good way! Avery's entire life changes in the course of one night, and while I didn't understand how she could just up and leave with strangers, I will say that she's brave and follows her gut. In true Jessie fashion, I chose the wrong guy and fell head over heels for Stellan and just thought Jack was cute. I loved the ""clues,"" the chases, the running and all the action. Avery and Jack get so beaten up but just keep on rolling. I will say that I wanted to see more of the families. They are so mysterious, so vicious, and I felt that if they have their fingers in every pie, then they would have been closer to finding what Jack and Avery found. I've already downloaded the audiobook.I am seriously ticked I have to wait so long for the sequel, especially with that ending! It's one of the more unique and fun books I've read in a while, and I loved that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I can't even imagine what will happen next.

"Why you should read it: I've enjoyed every Ella Frank book I've read and was excited to pick up this new NA from her. I love tarot cards, as you all know from last week, and wanted to see what Ella's spin was on them, and wow … I love the world-building and all the characters (there are quite a few and multiple POVs). This was the first book I've read with quintuplets, and I can't wait for the next book in the series! I can't decide what I like more: the romance and hot heroes or the fantasy elements of the book. It was a perfect mix of both rich setting and steam. It seems like Ella excels in any genre she writes in, and I'm passing this along to my mother, who loves fantasy as much as I do. I'm not saying much about the plot and characters here because anything I say could be spoiler-ish. I will say that if you love fantasy, action, a really awesome heroine and heroes (you'll want to call dibs on Kai!), pick up this new series. I really wish this would be made into an audiobook.

"Why you should read it: Whenever I'm in the mood for hot alphas and a very steamy romance, I always got to Stephanie Tyler. She had me hooked from her Defiance series. This is the third book in her Section 8 series, and we are treated to bigger-than-life heroes and the heroines who love them. I do recommend reading the series in order, since this book picks up right after Unbreakable.I love Jem. He wants Drea so bad and wants to protect her. Stephanie's heroes are so raw, so tormented and strong that they feel like living, flesh-and-blood characters. Like, if I go to the nearest bar, Jem will be chilling there. I was rooting for him the entire book, and it just broke my heart along with Jem's when Drea couldn't even remember why she wasn't supposed to be with Danny. And Drea … what a great heroine. She's had it rough. She's been through so much, and still I don't feel sorry for her. There's no pity, only admiration for the strong person she's become. The two together are electric, and this has been one of my favorite installments so far! All I can say is I can't wait for Jem's little brother.

"While this product is mostly marketed for use as a yoga backpack, I found that it's an excellent bag for much more than just that.One of my favorite things about this bag is how you wear it. It's a sling-stye bag, meaning you have one strap going across your chest rather than two on your shoulders like a traditional backpack. This makes it excellent for biking, so if you bike to your yoga class this would be perfect. Just as a general biking bag, however, this is great. Of course the bag is also excellent as a general backpack for just about anything.This bag has 6 pockets; two in the front, one inside of one of the front pockets, a large, main pocket, a laptop pocket, and a phone pocket on the strap.- The phone pocket is very nice as you have easy access to your phone even while the bag is on, and it's well secured through elastic and a velcro strap. The pocket fit an iPhone 6S pretty well, but I don't think it would really fit any phone bigger than that.- The two front pockets are great for small electronic items or keys, a wallet, etc. The pocket inside of the 2nd front pocket is ideal for really small items, or your valuables that you don't want to leave easily accessible.- The main pocket opens from the side and there is some fabric to hide the zipper a bit. This pocket doesn't have any smaller pockets inside of it or anything like that, it's just a good multi-use main pocket.- The laptop pocket also opens from the side, but it only opens halfway. This means you could open it and place your laptop inside, and the laptop wouldn't fall out even if you didn't do up the zipper. This would change if you actually tried to tip the laptop out, but the half-zipper adds quite a bit of security to the laptop pocketOne of the main things that makes this a ""yoga backpack"" is the addition of the two straps on the side of the bag. These are meant to hold your yoga mat, but they are very useful for holding other things too. You could hold a sleeping mat, a blanket, a tripod, or anything like that. The straps are also adjustable, so you can secure things with a wide variety of diameters.As for the actual quality of the backpack, it is made out of very durable nylon that definitely feels like it's built to last. The zippers could be a bit smoother, but I don't think I'll have any problems with them coming off or getting caught or anything like that.Overall this is an extremely nice bag for almost any use. While it's marketed as a yoga backpack, this bag is excellent for much more than just yoga.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WN2XLWC609B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPXOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WN2XLWC609B6","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this pack was under $10, it wouldn't be a bad investment for somebody looking to get some new colors of watch bands. However due to the lack of included adapters and the fact that these are just extremely cheap silicone bands, $17 is too much in my opinion.The bands' quality isn't TERRIBLE, but you can definitely tell that they are pretty cheap. Pairing this cheap of a band with something as premium as an Apple Watch isn't something I'd do personally, but to each their own. One of the main problems I had with the bands was the size. I think these are comparable to the largest size band that comes with the Apple Watch Sport, and so they're pretty big. While it wouldn't take much to punch an extra hole in the band, it would be nice if they had some size indicator or something like that so that you would know what you're buying.Overall these bands wouldn't be terrible if they were about half the price. They're still very cheap, but if you're paying less you aren't really expecting a super high-end band. These are just really thin and it seems like the metal pieces will fall out of them at any time.

The quality is pretty good for the price/quantity ratio, I just wouldn't trust these to secure anything more than an ID card or MAYBE some keys.

"Don't get me wrong - this cable is very nice - I just can't really see the practicality.This cable is extremely well made and it charges things very fast. It has a 2A max output, and so if you combine with with a 2A USB power source and a device that accepts a 2A charging input, you will charge this device VERY fast. However, most phones don't accept a 2A input, and that's where this cable becomes impractical for me. I prefer the standard, non-flat Micro USB cables, as they are much more flexible and it's a lot easier to hide the excess cable. With the cable from Crabby Digital you won't have to worry about tangling, but you have to deal with a much bigger cable.My other problem with this Crabby Digital cable is the size of the Micro-USB connector. Not the actual metal piece that goes into your phone, but the piece around it. This piece is much larger than on the majority of Micro-USB cables, and so if you have a semi-bulky phone case you will have to remove it before you charge your phone with this cable.One thing that is extremely nice is Crabby Digital's lifetime warranty. You pay $13 and you get a reliable Micro-USB cable forever, even if the cable breaks it can be replaced. This combined with the cable's reliability and fast charging speeds makes it an excellent cable, I just wish the area around the Micro-USB was smaller and that the cable wasn't flat.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKS9BIUH22L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ68L0E#wasThisHelpful","R2VKS9BIUH22L2","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this case still takes away from the look of the Apple Watch enough that I won't use it, I would say this is the most attractive Apple Watch protective case you can get.My main problem with Apple Watch cases, as I have said, is the look. The Apple Watch is a fashion statement almost more than anything else, and people saying ""Oh is that an Apple Watch"" is I think one of the main reasons people buy the Apple Watch. Putting a case on it makes it less recognizable as an Apple Watch, and I personally think it just doesn't look as good as without the case.However, the obvious benefit of having a case on your Watch is protection. Since watches are strapped to our wrists, they're very, very easily scratch-able. You may accidentally bump your wrist up against something at any time, and so having a case is definitely not a bad idea. The case provides excellent protection for all sides of the Watch, and there is a well-raised lip around the Watch's screen. This should theoretically protect the screen in the event of an impact, and buying this $10 case could save you from having to replace a $350(minimum) Apple Watch.Overall, if you are sure you want to put a case on your Apple Watch I would say this one is your best bet. The case is slim, light, and very protective. It's actually semi-attractive, but I personally enjoy the look of the Apple Watch too much to put a case on it.I attached several photos of the Apple Watch in this case so you can get an idea of the look.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFM803B60QMQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PZR4DQ#wasThisHelpful","RFM803B60QMQE","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can get double the amount of accessories for like $4 more than this kit, or you can get almost as many accessories for less than half the price of this kit. I just can't really see why you would choose this specific kit unless the price was lowered or you really needed the specific accessories in this kit.That being said, there's nothing wrong with this kit (except for the tripod; it's really cheap feeling) and all of the accessories (except for the tripod, again) function as they should. They're all very well made ("""") and like I said, if the price was lowered by like $5 this kit would be very attractive.I attached photos of every accessory that comes with this kit so that you can get a better look at them.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHMTARDKL5YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142JF7A2#wasThisHelpful","RPHMTARDKL5YJ","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 8:53 Mins This is a review for the OTG Hub-White, it'd be nice if the seller didn't sell several different products under the same listing but it is what it is. As for the hub, it works very well but it's extremely cheap-feeling.

"How well this camera works (wirelessly) largely depends on your internet speed. If you have fast, reliable internet, this camera works very well. The video is in stunning quality, not something I was expecting from a camera at this price. If your internet is slow, however, there will be a large delay for both the video and the in-app controls.Anyway, included in the box are -CameraAntennaPower cableEthernet cableWall MountScrewsAnchorsManualInstallation CDPackaging -Upon opening the box, you notice that everything is very well packed in foam made custom for this product. Even if your package is abused a little in the shipping process, your camera should be just fine. The camera is in a little foam bag inside of the main foam in the box, the manual comes in a bag, the disc comes in a plastic sleeve, the Ethernet cables comes twist-tied, the screws/anchors are in a bag, the power cable comes twist tied, and the mount and antenna are loose in the foam. Pretty sure that wasn't particularly important, but I thought I'd include it.Setup -The included instruction manual is VERY easy to follow. It provides step by step information on how to set the device up, with pictures/screenshots of the software. It shows you how to set up the camera with a wired connection, and then shows you how to set it up wirelessly. By ""wired"" it just means that it is wired directly to your router, rather than being in a completely separate room. If you are able to, I would use this device with a wired connection to reduce the video delay. However even on a wireless connection there isn't more than a couple second delay. The manual also shows you how to set up the camera with HooToo's smartphone app. On the bottom of the camera itself is a QR code, which you may scan within the app. Scanning this automatically fills out all of the devices info (except the password) which is a really nice and easy way of doing so. Within the app you may control the camera, monitor audio, and even use your phone's mic to speak through the camera's speaker.Design -The camera can swivel just about 360 degrees, and it can tilt up or down quite a bit. This will allow you to look around a room or something using the application on your phone or your computer. The movements are relatively smooth and fluid, the camera isn't constantly jerking up or down while you are adjusting it. The included wall mount is also adjustable, so you can really point this camera just about anywhere in a room, if you plan on using it in a fixed postilion. I was very impressed by the IR night vision. I was expecting it to work, but not as well as it does. You can almost see as much as if it light, the only difference is the color. This makes this a great security camera, as it will record very well in both the light and the dark. The only downside to using this as a security camera is if your wifi goes out, you are unprotected. This camera doesn't support recording directly to an SD card; you have to stream it from another device and save it to that device. The speaker on this camera is really tiny, quiet, and not very high quality. If you wanted to tell someone something through this camera, they'd better be very close to it or they're not going to hear you. The mic however isn't bad. There was a little static, but it could pick up noises and conversations pretty well.Overall, if you have good, reliable internet this is a great camera. There are many settings that you can use to customize this to your liking. Everything you need to set the camera up is included, and the wall mount is very nice as I imagine a lot of people would like this on their wall. The night vision is really good, and the rotation possibilities of the camera make it so you can place the camera almost anywhere in a room and still be able to see where you would like to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QE3GNK3KDEI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017NNTYR6#wasThisHelpful","R3QE3GNK3KDEI8","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this is definitely one of the least-expensive selfie sticks I have seen, after using the selfie pole for a bit I can kind of see why it's so inexpensive.One of the main problems with this selfie pole is that when you press the little built-in shutter button, it only registers on the phone about half the time. This might just be a problem with my unit specifically, but I found that I was having to repeatedly press the shutter button in order to actually take a picture.As for the overall feel of the selfie stick, you can definitely feel that it is made with pretty low end materials. It's fairly flimsy, and the grip on the handle just feels cheap. I wouldn't trust that this selfie pole would last very long, but then again, it's only $7.Overall you get what you pay for with this selfie stick. If it's just my unit that has the shutter button issue, this is a pretty good deal. If not, the selfie stick still functions, just not very well. You can determine if it's a worthwhile purchase, I personally would recommend spending a bit more for a selfie stick that works better and will last longer.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDTF9Y2Z1WS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HDLBJS#wasThisHelpful","R3NDTF9Y2Z1WS8","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This device has many features, and every feature I have tested works extremely well. This devices is marketed as a 'travel' router, which means that it should be easy to travel with. It definitely is, weighing in at just over 5 oz. The device is about as thick as 1 1/2 decks of cards, about the same length as a deck of cards, and slightly less wide than a deck of cards. The build quality is great, it seems like it could be loosely placed in a bag with no problems. There are protective covers for the WAN and USB output port, but unfortunately the SD card slot is left open all the time. My only concern would be the possibility of a thin object damaging the internals of the slot.As a media sharing hub -This device will allow you to read files from USB flash drives, external hard drives, and SD cards on virtually any iOS device, Android, or PC. I think being able to read the files from an iOS device is particularly useful, because with a PC you could just plug the flash drive in, and most Android devices have Micro-SD card slots that could be used to read files. I believe you could have multiple people connect to this device, however, and so putting a ton of movies on a Flash Drive for a car ride would allow everyone (except the driver) to watch their own movies without having to have them on the device they are using. One of the most useful features of this device is being able to take photos from your iOS device and put them onto a flash drive. Say you're on vacation and you are taking a ton of photos on your iPhone. You start running out of storage, but to alleviate this, you simply connect to a flash drive through the FileHub and transfer all of your pictures over. This is much easier than plugging your phone into a computer, and many people don't even have a computer while traveling. This of course also applies to Android devices, but with the exception of Androids without Micro-SD card slots, I don't see this being as useful as with iOS devices.As a power bank -This devices houses 6000mAh, and despite having many more features than a standard power bank, it's almost exactly the same size as several 6000mAh power banks that I own. I even have a 5400mAh power bank that is bigger than this 6000mAh one. However there is one very big con with this FileHub, and it's that the charging output is only 1A. This means extremely slow charging times for anything other than really old cell phones or very tiny devices. Most smartphones nowadays charge at 2.1A, and most tablets at 2.4A. Charging a device at 1A won't harm the device, but your device will charge significantly slower than if it were being charged at 2.1A. The FileHub also doesn't turn off once it has charged a device to 100%. Almost every power bank I own turns off automatically, but this one does not. I'm not sure if that means that extra battery is being used, but it still seems like it should turn off once it has charged a device to its full capacity.As a router -I tested this device by unplugging my router, and plugging this device in directly to my modem. Connecting was as easy as connecting to the FileHub through my phone's Wi-Fi settings, and then I was connected to the internet. Setting the FileHub up as a bridge is much more complicated, but I did not test this feature so I am unable to comment on it. While this device was connected to my modem I got about 30 feet of range out of it. Not a ton, but plenty for use in a hotel room or something similar. This device is made for travel, after all, and so 30ft is plenty. The connection remained steady, even when I put my phone to sleep. Sometimes I have a problem with my phone taking a while to connect to a Wi-Fi network after waking up from sleep mode, but I didn't have that problem with this FileHub. I see many people complain about the security of this device, but I don't see it as a huge problem. I wouldn't personally recommend doing anything with banking and such, although in reality it should be encrypted on the bank's side of things so you should still be fine.Overall, this device packs many features into one little device so it really is great for traveling. Some people may bring along a bunch of other devices in order to transfer photos from their camera to their phone or external hard drive, but with this device, you can transfer between all three of these things without having to bring a bunch of equipment. The only real con I can see to this product is the 1A charging output, but even that isn't a huge deal if you're patient.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWKF5N62MS0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ZWS9ZE#wasThisHelpful","R3GWKF5N62MS0W","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I wouldn't say these silicone wine (glasses?) are the most attractive containers to drink from, they are definitely very functional.They had a very chemical-smell to them when I first took them out of the packaging, but this was fixed after a quick run through the dishwasher.On a lot of cheaper silicone items you might see seams and extra pieces of silicone hanging off the product. This isn't the case with these wine glasses, they are very well molded and they feel like they're built to last. Even if they don't, it looks like Freshlove has a 100% money-back guarantee. I wouldn't expect anyone to have to utilize that, but it's extremely nice to know that Freshlove stands behind the quality of their products.Maybe it was just because of the initial chemical-smell, but I was totally expecting these glasses to alter the taste of whatever I was drinking from them. I'm happy to report that I didn't notice any difference in taste between drinking from these and an actual wine glass. However drinking from the silicone did feel pretty weird, and you have to be much more careful that you don't squeeze your glass while you're using it.I see camping as one of the main uses for these glasses. They are much more portable than plastic, they are nicer to drink from (unless you don't like the feel of silicone) and you really can't break them unless you're trying to. Even plastic can be broken, and so I would say these are the ultimate camping wine glasses. Any other occasion I would probably recommend plastic (if you really can't use glass) just because of how it looks, but as far as silicone wine glasses go, these ones from Freshlove are great.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X44TDWOO8MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163N0H8M#wasThisHelpful","R37X44TDWOO8MC","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these trays won't make FLAWLESS ice spheres, they can get pretty close depending on how much care you put into filling them. Using the right amount of water and making sure the water is only in the spheres and not around them should give you some pretty nice ice spheres. Unfortunately I wasn't all that careful when I filled up my tray, so the sphere had some extra ice attached to it. There were also a ton of cracks in the ice, but that's going to happen when you place the spheres in a drink anyway.Supposedly ice spheres keep drinks cold for longer than ice cubes, so there's a benefit apart from the fact that the spheres look really cool. You get two trays, so you can make 8 spheres at a time. The spheres are decent sized, you can fit about 3 in a pint glass. Three of these spheres would keep your drink cold for a very long time, and you'd still have spheres left over afterwards.These trays feel like they're built to last. I can't imagine them falling apart any time soon, but even if they do, they're backed by a lifetime guarantee. $16 for two sphere ice trays that are guaranteed to last a lifetime, pretty good if you ask me.Overall these trays are an excellent way to make ice spheres. The spheres are easy to make, they look nice, and they keep drinks cold longer than traditional ice cubes. Especially if you put a lot of effort into filling the trays up, you can make some really fancy looking beverages that will stay cold for a long time.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AY8DI5NIXLDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163YMBIU#wasThisHelpful","R2AY8DI5NIXLDG","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only used these trays for ice, unfortunately I didn't even think about using them for candy or something like that. The molds work extremely well for ice, and so I I'm sure they would work for other things just as well.When I first got these they had a pretty bad rubber smell, and I definitely wouldn't have felt comfortable making something consumable with them. However I put them in the dishwasher, and they came out clean and intact.Making ice was as simple as filling the molds with water and putting them in the freezer. Making something like candy would definitely be more difficult, but the result would also last quite a bit longer. I then took the trays out about 6 hours later, and I had a bunch of fun ice figures waiting for me. They were extremely easy to take out of the mold, I didn't have to use any hot water or anything like that. This is because of the flexible design of the trays, and while it may make transporting the not-yet-solid figures more difficult, you'll appreciate the design when it comes time to remove the solid figures.Overall, these molds are made of very high quality silicone and I'm not worried about them falling apart any time soon. I was surprised by the quality when I initially picked up the trays, and I was even more satisfied with how the ice figures turned out. These molds are a great inexpensive way to make some interesting ice, and they'd make even cooler candies or crayons.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHG0EVTQKTEGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01631S0GK#wasThisHelpful","RHG0EVTQKTEGY","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Selfie poles are made by soooooooo many companies nowadays that it's hard to really select which one is best for you. This one from Pomarks is excellent in my opinion, but there is one thing that may deter people from it, and that's the lack of a standard tripod threading. I'll get into this more in the ""portability"" section (I'm breaking this review up into multiple parts). I've also included a ton of photos, I hope you find them to be helpful.1) FunctionalityThis is a wireless selfie pole, which I prefer over wired ones. I find that wired ones take longer to actually take pictures, and if you press the button 5 times they may only take 2 pictures. With wired selfie poles, such as this one, not only do you not have to worry about plugging anything in, the shutter button also seems to work better. The only downside I can think of is the fact that you'll have to charge the pole every once in a while, but that's as simple as plugging in a micro-USB cable for a couple hours. To pair this selfie pole you simply hold down the shutter button until the light starts blinking. Then you go into your phone's Bluetooth settings, and the selfie pole should show up as ""POMARKS"". Tapping on the name should pair it, and you're good to go. When you press the shutter button, it simulates pressing the ""volume up"" button on iPhone. This takes a picture in the iPhone's camera app, and in Snapchat. It may not work in other photography apps, but you can test this by seeing if you can take a photo by pressing the volume button. On Android I believe it's different, but I did not use this selfie pole on an Android device.2) BuildThis selfie pole is very well built, you can tell that it's a high-quality product. The only thing is that when the selfie pole is fully extended with an iPhone 6s on the end, it bows slightly. Not enough to worry me, but it bows a little more than other selfie poles I have used. Again, I'm not super worried about it. The shutter button feels pretty good, and the handle is one of my favorite parts of this selfie pole. It's made of nice quality rubber, and there are little ridges and bumps on it for grip. There is also a wrist strap which attaches to the bottom of the pole, so even if your hand did somehow slip you should be okay.3) PortabilityMost selfie poles are made to be portable, but more recently companies have been coming out with a design that allows the ""phone holder"" to fold down onto the pole. This is the case with this selfie pole.This makes the selfie pole MUCH more portable, with the downside being that the phone holder is permanently attached. On some selfie poles you can simply unscrew the ""phone holder"", and attach something like a point-and-shoot camera or a GoPro. This isn't the case with this selfie pole, which has its pros and cons. We also get a carrying pouch for the selfie stick, which is of course great for portability and traveling. The phone holder's angle can also be adjusted, so you can choose whether or not to show the selfie pole in the shot, decrease glare, etc.Overall this is a great selfie stick, definitely up there for one of the best I have used. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is if you wanted to be able to mount a GoPro as well as a phone, but for just mounting phones, this selfie stick is great.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140UD4C0A4ELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CX3ERO#wasThisHelpful","R140UD4C0A4ELL","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When buying a pair of sport headphones, there are 6 main things I consider -- Comfort- Whether or not they stay in your ears- How well they connect to your phone- Physical appearance/Build quality- Battery life- Ease of use/SoundThis headset excels in every category, with the one exception maybe being comfort.Comfort -This headset, out of the box, fits very well in my ears. There are a TON of different sizes of ear tips and such, so if out of the box these don't fit very well, I'm sure you can change some things so that they do. The fit in my ears isn't why I thought these were slightly uncomfortable, it's the loose cable that connects the ear pieces. The cable kinda flops around while you exercise, which can be pretty irritating. I would much prefer if it was a wire or a formed cable, one that doesn't move around at all and fits with your head.I've used several ""sport"" headsets that aren't really good for much because they don't stay in your ears. If you're buying a sport headset you're most likely going to be moving around a lot, and so whether or not the headphones stay in your ears is very important. This headset was great, the ear pieces never fell out of my ear. Rather than simply a rubber ear tip there's also a piece that rests inside your ear, kind of like a fan shaped rubber piece. Headsets that have these generally stay in your ear better, so that's something to watch out for when buying a sport headset. This headset of course has those, and it also includes several different sizes of them. I think this plays a big part in why these headphones stay in your ears so well, along with the overall design of the headset and the angle at which the rubber ear tips are positioned.Connectivity -It's not too common, but sometimes I'll use a sport headset that has about 6 inches of range. Meaning you'll have your phone in your pocket, the headset in your ears, and you'll lose connection. There are also headsets that have a super choppy connection while running, but this headset suffers from none of those problems. Connecting is easy, and the headset stays connected as long as you are within reasonable range. By reasonable I mean up to around 30 feet, much better than the 6 inches on some headsets.Physical Appearance/Build Quality -Vastar manages to pack in good sound, media controls, and good connectivity to a headset that keeps a fairly small form factor. Some wireless headsets have an in-line media remote, and I can't stand using those. Generally the cable on wireless headsets is really short, which makes the in-line remote up somewhere behind/right beside your neck. It's great that Vastar avoided these in-line controls, and instead they put the controls on the headset. This improves the overall look in my opinion, while boosting ease of use and functionality as well. As for the build quality, this is an extremely well built headset. Everything about it feels sturdy, and I feel like this headset is definitely built to last.Battery Life -Vastar advertises 6.5 hours of battery life, and while that may not seem like a bit, it can actually go a long way depending on how active you are. This headset's standby battery life is excellent, meaning it won't lose much battery at all while it is off. Say you work out for about an hour each day, you'll only have to charge this headset once a week. Of course it all depends on how much you're actually using this headset, but the 6.5 hours is pretty much of actual use and you can go many days with this headset off and not really see any decrease in its battery life.Ease of use/Sound -Connecting to this headset is incredibly simple, but that's not exactly what I'm focusing on when I look at ease of use. I'm looking at how easy it is to pull out these headphones and get them working, and then how easy it is to control media from the headset. Once these headphones are paired with your phone you simply turn them on (assuming your phone has Bluetooth enabled) and you're good to go. You can select a song, put your phone in your pocket, and you're ready. From the headset you can skip tracks, pause/play music, and adjust the volume. On some headsets the pause/play/answer calls button is on top of the headset. which is in your ear when you're actually using it. This doesn't do much good at all, so it's nice that Vastar included the main button on the side of the headset. This makes using the button very easy, so you don't have to awkwardly fiddle in your ear if you want to pause the music to talk to someone or answer a phone call. As for sound quality, this headset is pretty good. Obviously it's not GREAT, as it's a $30 headset that's sole purpose is to be used while exercising. Sound is still kept in mind on sport headsets, but you can never really expect great sound quality even compared to a wired pair of headphones for the same price. While using this headset I did notice that a lot of sound is blocked out, which is both a good and bad thing. Good is that your music arguably sounds better, you can't hear all the people around you, and you can concentrate better. Bad is that you can't really hear cars or people, so using these on outdoor runs, especially at night, might not be a good idea. The noise-isolation also causes you to kind of hear everything you do much louder, kind of like when you plug your ears. Talking sounds weird, swallowing is made louder, and your breathing has the potential to drive you insane. This takes some getting used to, and I know there are some people out there that would never really be able to get used to it. However if you are playing music it isn't that bad, just when you have the music paused or you are in-between songs.Overall I enjoy using this headset, and while there are a few flaws that I have mentioned, it's a very nice headset overall.Note: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback and evaluation.Thanks for reading, I hope you found this review to be helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251CBGJUA65ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SDC2A2#wasThisHelpful","R251CBGJUA65ZA","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not only does this speaker look really good, it is very functional as well.Structurally, this speaker is excellent. It is incredibly well built, and it simply feels like a very high-quality product right out of the box. We have rubber covering all of the buttons, and plenty of metal and screws to add to the rugged look. This does more than just make the speaker look good; IPX5 Waterproof coating protects the speaker against splashes, mud, and dust, proving that the speaker is functionally as rugged as it looks.When you buy a speaker like this, that is, a very rugged speaker priced at under $30, I think you will care more about if you can throw it in the mud than how it sounds. It's going to be very hard to find a budget speaker that is rugged without compromising sound quality. That being said, this speaker doesn't sound terrible. I would say that it's comparable to about a $15, non-rugged speaker. The sound out of the box is pretty tinny.  Highs are somewhat sharp, but mids sound pretty good. It really depends on the song, but I've noticed that some songs sound incredible while other songs are exactly the opposite. I'm not taking a star off for sound quality, because like I said, you're most likely buying this speaker for its ability to withstand the elements, and with that comes a small sacrifice in audio quality.If for some reason you are not wanting to use this speaker via Bluetooth, you have the option of using the included aux cable. One thing to note is that while you are using this speaker in a wired connection it loses its IPX5 waterproofness. This is because you have to have a rubber flap open, and the micro-USB charging port is exposed. So while you can technically use this speaker via an aux cord, you will be sacrificing one of the best features of the speaker.Two somewhat overlooked features of this speaker are the carrying strap and the tripod socket. I'm not entirely sure when I would use the tripod socket, but I guess if you have a use for it it's a nice addition. The carrying strap, however, is extremely useful. It's made of rubber, so it will dry very quickly and continue being comfortable to hold. You can also unscrew the screw on the strap, and attach the speaker to a backpack or something similar. The strap will be very secure, so you don't have to worry about the speaker falling off. This makes it very convenient to listen to music while backpacking or something, and you don't even have to hold the speaker.Overall, this is an excellent rugged speaker for a very good price. There are definitely some sacrifices made in sound quality, but you're buying this speaker to be rugged. You won't really find an excellent sounding waterproof speaker, especially for this price.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XDREHT79EC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122N42LK#wasThisHelpful","R21XDREHT79EC9","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great selfie stick, however I think there may be better alternatives. The only reason is because of the fact that this selfie stick's remote requires batteries. Most selfie sticks are rechargeable nowadays, and so having to replace the batteries is extremely inconvenient. However, batteries are included and they will probably last for quite a while. It's just when the remote battery dies that you will be wishing you could simply recharge it. The benefit of having batteries is that you are able to remove the remote from the Selfie Pole. This means that you could set your phone down somewhere and use the remote to take a picture. This is instead of having the remote built into the selfie pole, but I personally think a rechargeable built-in is better than a battery powered remote. It can definitely vary from person to person, you may see a huge benefit in having a detachable remote.The overall feel of this selfie pole is excellent. This one from SelfieGo has the best grip out of any selfie pole I've used, there are actual places for your fingers on the back of the handle. The entire design feels very sturdy, and you can tell that a lot of time went into the design.This selfie pole is also extremely portable. The pole itself telescopes down like every other selfie pole, but then the phone holder actually folds down onto the pole; which isn't as common. This allows the selfie pole to get quite compact, although it will be thicker than most selfie poles if you have the remote attached to the handle. No carrying case or anything is included, which is unfortunate.This selfie pole works as expected, which is of course a very good thing. You simply pair the remote to your phone via Bluetooth, and then whenever you press the button on the remote it simulates pressing the ""volume up"" button on your iPhone. This will take a picture in most camera apps, it definitely works in the iPhone's camera app and Snapchat. When you aren't in an app and you press the remote, your phone's volume will simply go up a notch.One of the main things I look for in selfie pole's is security. If I am trusting this device to secure my $750 phone, I want to make sure it's going to do just that. The grip on this selfie pole's handle is excellent, and there is a wrist strap. Dropping the selfie pole shouldn't be a problem, which is good. The other thing is how securely the phone is actually being held. I didn't see any problems here either, I was able to gently shake the selfie pole without my phone slipping at all.Overall this is a great selfie pole if you're looking for one with a detachable remote. It's still a great selfie pole either way, but the fact that you can't recharge this selfie pole is enough for me to recommend a different one that has a built in remote. It all depends on your use and how much you value having a detachable remote, and it's your decision in the end.Thanks for reading this review, I hope you found it helpful.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLRYFSKVX7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B4ZVO8#wasThisHelpful","RCLRYFSKVX7S","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the least expensive GoPro accessory kits I have seen, and it comes with almost every mount/accessory you would need for a GoPro. All of the parts seem to be of very high quality, except for the little tripod which is super cheaply made. The tripod is very hard to adjust, and minute adjustments are impossible. It's okay if you are using it as a standard tripod, but if you're trying to wrap the legs around a pole or something you may have a difficult time.

"I’m always hesitant to try 3rd party lightning cables due to the fact that so many of them cause my iPhone 6 to display the message “accessory not supported”. This was not the case with this cable, and I was very relieved. The cable is only 1m, which may be a bit short for some people. The part around the lightning cable is also a bit large, so it may not fit with some more rugged cases. Other than these two things, this cable is arguably better than the one that Apple sells. Apple’s lightning cables tend to break after 6 months or so, but this cable from YellowKnife is braided so it should be a lot sturdier. The braiding also prevents tangling, but that’s not really a problem I’ve had with any lightning cables. As for charging/data transfer, this cable seemed to charge about the same as my Apple lightning cable. I didn’t get out a stopwatch or anything like that, but the difference wasn’t enough to make me notice and switch back to Apple’s cable. Data transfer also seemed to be about the same. Overall this is a great cable, it’s cheaper than Apple’s and I’m convinced that it’s going to last longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1KZSBU9Y0ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SS5T10#wasThisHelpful","R2M1KZSBU9Y0ST","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a ton of third party lightning cables, and quite few of them either charge really slowly or they say “accessory not supported” with my iPhone 6. This particular cable suffers from neither of these problems, and except for the length, it looks similar to the lightning cables from Apple until you feel it. It feels like it was made with a slightly lower grade rubber and plastic, but considering it’s a fraction of the price compared to Apple’s, it makes sense. The cable is slightly less flexible than Apple's, which will probably make it last longer. There aren’t any logos or anything on the cable (like Apple’s), so it looks really nice. Functionality wise this cable is better than Apple’s, because of the extra length. Technically you’re not supposed to use your phone while it’s charging, but I’m pretty sure everyone ignores that. The extra length of this cable doesn’t seem to affect charging times and it makes the cable much less noticeable because of the extra freedom you have to move the phone around.  Overall it’s hard to go wrong with this cable, it’s similar to Apple’s (except for the additional length) and for a fraction of the price.This is a review of the Yellowknife Extra Long 10ft / 3m USB to Lightning Cable, I wish the cables were listed under separate listings so that the reviews weren't all weird.Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA7OM9L67VIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5A4E5W#wasThisHelpful","RUA7OM9L67VIO","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Micro-USB cables are extremely common nowadays, so many devices use them for charging and data transfer. Unfortunately, a lot of Micro-USB cables that come with lower-end products end up being very cheap feeling, too short, or not working exactly as they should. This set from Eoso suffers from none of these problems, and I would consider these to be the ""perfect"" micro-USB cables for the majority of tasks. They are extremely well made, which is shown in how they feel. You can tell that Eoso used higher-grade materials in these cables, it's nothing like those Micro-USB cables that come with super generic selfie poles or Bluetooth speakers. Each cable is three feet long, which I think is great for most things. You may want a longer cable if your outlet is far from your nightstand and you may want a shorter one for use with portable chargers, but I think 3 feet is pretty average and so these cables suffice. As for charging/data transfer, everything is extremely fast. With buying cables on eBay or something you never know how much of a charge the cables will allow to pass through. This could result in your phone charging much slower than it should, but these cables don't have that problem. My Galaxy S6 charged as fast as it would using Samsung's cable, and I noticed no differences in data transfer rates. Overall, these are great cables, and they are very fairly priced as well. I recommend them to anyone that wants a fast, reliable Micro-USB cable that feels like it's built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVZ0QNJ3U512/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HT8XZU#wasThisHelpful","R3NVZ0QNJ3U512","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not only does this cable look more interesting than your standard Apple lightning cable, it's more functional too. With Apple lightning cables I find that after 6 months or so they no longer work. Different pieces of them break, Apple's lightning cables seem to be oddly cheap. This cable should solve that problem, the braided design should make the cable much more durable. The USB and lightning ends are also of much higher quality, this cable just feels like it's going to last longer. The extra length of this cable is extremely nice as well.

"When buying a pair of sport headphones, there are 6 main things I consider -- Comfort- Whether or not they stay in your ears- How well they connect to your phone- Physical appearance/Build quality- Battery life- Ease of use/SoundThis headset excels in every category, with the one exception maybe being comfort.Comfort -This headset, out of the box, fits very well in my ears. There are several different sizes of ear tips and such, so if out of the box these don't fit very well, I'm sure you can find a ear tip that does. The fit in my ears isn't why I thought these were slightly uncomfortable, it's the loose cable that connects the ear pieces. The cable kinda flops around while you exercise, which can be pretty irritating. I would much prefer if it was a wire or a formed cable, one that doesn't move around at all and fits with your head.I've used several ""sport"" headsets that aren't really good for much because they don't stay in your ears. If you're buying a sport headset you're most likely going to be moving around a lot, and so whether or not the headphones stay in your ears is very important. This headset was great, the ear pieces never fell out of my ear. Rather than simply a rubber ear tip there's also a piece that rests inside your ear, kind of like a fan shaped rubber piece. Headsets that have these generally stay in your ear better, so that's something to watch out for when buying a sport headset. This headset of course has those, and it also includes several different sizes of them. I think this plays a big part in why these headphones stay in your ears so well, along with the overall design of the headset and the angle at which the rubber ear tips are positioned.Connectivity -It's not too common, but sometimes I'll use a sport headset that has about 6 inches of range. Meaning you'll have your phone in your pocket, the headset in your ears, and you'll lose connection. There are also headsets that have a super choppy connection while running, but this headset suffers from none of those problems. Connecting is easy, and the headset stays connected as long as you are within reasonable range. By reasonable I mean up to around 30 feet, much better than the 6 inches on some headsets.Physical Appearance/Build Quality -Mpow manages to pack in good sound, media controls, and good connectivity to a headset that keeps a fairly small form factor. Some wireless headsets have an in-line media remote, and I can't stand using those. Generally the cable on wireless headsets is really short, which makes the in-line remote up somewhere behind/right beside your neck. It's great that Mpow avoided these in-line controls, and instead they put the controls on the headset. This improves the overall look in my opinion, while boosting ease of use and functionality as well. As for the build quality, this is an extremely well built headset. Everything about it feels sturdy, and from using Mpow's products in the past I know that this headset is definitely built to last.Battery Life -Mpow advertises 5 hours of battery life, and while that may not seem like a bit, it can actually go a long way depending on how active you are. This headset's standby battery life is excellent, meaning it won't lose much battery at all while it is off. Say you work out for an hour each day, you'll only have to charge this headset every 5 days. Of course it all depends on how much you're actually using this headset, but the 5 hours is pretty much of actual use and you can go many days with this headset off and not really see any decrease in its battery life.Ease of use/Sound -Connecting to this headset is incredibly simple, but that's not exactly what I'm focusing on when I look at ease of use. I'm looking at how easy it is to pull out these headphones and get them working, and then how easy it is to control media from the headset. Once these headphones are paired with your phone you simply turn them on (assuming your phone has Bluetooth enabled) and you're good to go. You can select a song, put your phone in your pocket, and you're good to go. From the headset you can skip tracks, pause/play music, and adjust the volume. On some headsets the pause/play/answer calls button is on top of the headset. which is in your ear when you're actually using it. This doesn't do much good at all, so it's nice that Mpow included the main button on the side of the headset. This makes using the button very easy, so you don't have to awkwardly fiddle in your ear if you want to pause the music to talk to someone or answer a phone call. As for sound quality, this headset is pretty good. Obviously it's not GREAT, as it's a $30 headset that's sole purpose is to be used while exercising. Sound is still kept in mind on sport headsets, but you can never really expect great sound quality even compared to a wired pair of headphones for the same price. While using this headset I did notice that a lot of sound is blocked out, which is both a good and bad thing. Good is that your music arguably sounds better, you can't hear all the people around you, and you can concentrate better. Bad is that you can't really hear cars or people, so using these on outdoor runs, especially at night, might not be a good idea. The noise-isolation also causes you to kind of hear everything you do much louder, kind of like when you plug your ears. Talking sounds weird, swallowing is made louder, and your breathing has the potential to drive you insane. This takes some getting used to, and I know there are some people out there that would never really be able to get used to it. However if you are playing music it isn't that bad, just when you have the music paused or you are in-between songs.Overall I enjoy using this headset, and while there are a few flaws that I have mentioned, it's a very nice headset overall.Note: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback and evaluation.Thanks for reading, I hope you found this review to be helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MTVO8I9FA47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129WY50W#wasThisHelpful","R5MTVO8I9FA47","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I need to mount a GoPro or something I'll have to use a different Selfie Pole, but that's the only real reason I can think of.Note: I have noticed that this Selfie Pole is almost EXACTLY the same as one from The Memory Journalists, and The Memory Journalists one is slightly cheaper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNK83ZSWKJYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV3MCK2#wasThisHelpful","R1JNK83ZSWKJYG","A13HCQ0GD3BGAI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13HCQ0GD3BGAI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
