"I don't know whether this album is better than ""It's a Blue World"" but the two easily top my list of the Velvet Fog's best albums. If you don't know Mel Torm√©'s work, it's a great introduction.

"My parents had for over 30 years a cast aluminum griddle they loved. The heating element finally wouldn't take another repair. Trying a few griddles bought in retail stores, my folks were disappointed with each. None matched the even heating of their old standby. I bought the Broil King PCG-10 based on previous reviews touting its heat dispersion and heavy-duty construction. While Mom and Dad still mourn their original, they say this is ""nearly as good."" For a pair of septuagenarians set in their ways, that's high praise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2BE30YGM61L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BKXE02#wasThisHelpful","R2I2BE30YGM61L","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An ex-football player past his prime (6'3"", 360 lbs, size 13D, medium arch), I was recently diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. My orthopedist recommended daily stretching exercises and Orthoheel slippers to wear indoors (no more walking around in socks). What a difference! The slippers and exercises lessened my symptoms from the start and, over time, eliminated most of my discomfort, so I decided to find some orthotic inserts to improve my street shoes.So far, I've tested:1. Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Extra Support2. Aetrex Copper Medium Arch3. Spenco Polysorb Total Support4. Superfeet Copper DMP5. Powerstep Pinnacle6. Powerstep Pinnacle Proeach for two hours' total walking time over a few days in two pairs of my favorite shoes: New Balance 606 hikers and Cole Haan loafers with Nike Air.Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Extra Support: Advertised for big & tall men, they didn't do much for me. While the extra cushioning helped at first, it helped less and less the longer I walked on them. I mentioned this to my orthopod and he told me the key to managing PF is not cushioning, it's support. Grade: DSpenco Polysorb Total Support: Remembering my doc's advice, I chose these for the rigid heel cup and arch support. Though quite comfortable overall, the arch support was a bit too low for my medium-high arches and the heel cup was insufficient support for weight. While they worked reasonably well for me, I believe they would a be better choice for lighter individuals with lower arches. Grade: BAetrex Copper Medium Arch: Promising better arch support, these felt very similar to the Spenco insoles even after walking around the block. I then swapped one of the Aetrex insoles for one of the Spenco insoles and walked around again. Only then could I tell them apart. The Spenco offered a little better support for the mid- and fore-parts of my foot, the Aetrex offered a little better support for my arch. Grade: BSuperfeet: I was in an Allen Edmonds store and noticed the Superfeet insoles. The clerk said many men my size have good success with them. I tried the Orange and the Copper DMP versions in the store. Finding the Orange too high for my arches, I got a pair of the Copper DMP. These are easily the most rigid of the insoles I've tried...and easily the best. Superfeet arch support sits farther back on the insole than other brands. This made a real difference in the support and comfort I felt walking long distances. I also found the medial post support in the heel did a better job than other insoles in combatting over-pronation. Grade: A [Update: I have since tried Superfeet Black in dress shoes that couldn't accommodate the Orange insole. They work well but are not as supportive as the Copper.]Powerstep Pinnacle: While it seems well-made and offered good support, it simply did not work for me. The gel-based arch support sits too far forward and in the middle of the insole. The insoles felt like I had lumps of clay underfoot. After a few blocks of brisk walking, my feet began to fatigue as if I were walking barefoot in sand. Again, these may work for some people but they didn't for me. Grade: CPowerstep Pinnacle Pro: Other wearers commented that the Pinnacle Pro differs markedly from the Pinnacle, so I tried a pair. I barely made it a block before heading back home. Though more rigid than the Pinnacle and with a better heel cup, the Pinnacle Pro was too inflexible through the arch and ball of my foot. These were the only insoles I tried that truly caused me pain. Of course, it could just be the contours of my feet, and for others the Pinnacle Pro might be great.

"Just bought my second pair after wearing out my first after six years' regular use. As a big & tall guy, I need shoes that can handle 350+ lbs. I live in the city and walk to work, so I want shoes that look good in the office (so I don't have to change into another pair) as well as at clubs and restaurants after work. These shoes meet all my needs. With jeans or with suits, these shoes look great and get their fair share of compliments. [Note: I have these in both brown and black. If you're not a fan of contrast stitching, be aware that the black shoes have white stitching while the brown shoes have tan stitching that is less noticeable. Both look great to me. After repeat shoe polishings or mink oil treatment, the stitches on both styles darken considerably.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV8X5D17GY3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00394E02S#wasThisHelpful","RGV8X5D17GY3B","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This financial book is different from the 250+ other financial books that I have reviewed, and the hundreds of others I have read.  It tells real life stories that the author has personally experienced, and the financial ramifications that happened as a result.  Each of the 60+ stories illustrates a significant topic in financial planning for individuals and families.  Some end happy, some end sad.  There are examples from each of the possible outcomes that can result from people interacting with financial advice (in my rough large to small probability order):* Followed bad advice, or ignored good advice, and lost.* Followed good advice, and won.* A mixed outcome from mixed behavior* Followed bad advice, or ignored good advice, and won anyway.* Followed good advice, and lost anyway.The thing is, there is a ‚Äúluck‚Äù component to finance.  People don‚Äôt know the future behavior of markets, and may accidentally get it right or wrong.  With good advice, the odds can be tipped in their favor, at least to the point where they aren‚Äôt as badly hurt when markets get volatile.The stories in the book mostly stem from the author‚Äôs experience as a financial advisor/planner in Maryland.  The stories are 3-6 pages long, and can be read one at a time with little loss of flow.  The stories don‚Äôt depend on each other.  It is a book you can pick up and put down, and the value will be the same as for the person who reads it straight through.In general, I thought the author advocated good advice for his clients, family and friends.  Most people could benefit from reading this book.  It‚Äôs pretty basic, and maybe, _maybe_, one of your friends who isn‚Äôt so good with financial matters could benefit from it as a gift if you don‚Äôt need it yourself.  The reason I say this is that some people will learn reading about the failures of others rather than being advised by well-meaning family, friends, and professionals.  They may admit to themselves that they have been wrong when they be unwilling to do it with others.I recommend this book for readers who need motivation and knowledge to guide themselves in their financial dealings, including how to find a good advisor, and how to avoid bad advisors.QuibblesThe book lacks generality because of its focus on telling stories.  It would have been a much better book if it had one final chapter or appendix where the author would take all of the lessons, and weave them into a coherent whole.  If nothing else, such a chapter would be an excellent review of the lessons of the book, and could even footnote back to the stories in the book for where people could read more on a given point.I know this is a bias of mine regarding books with a lot of unrelated stories, but I think it is incumbent on the one telling the stories to flesh out the common themes, because many will miss those themes otherwise.  In all writing, specifics support generalities, and generalities support specifics.  They are always stronger together.An AsideI benefited from the book in one unusual way: it gave me a lot of article ideas, which you will be reading about at Aleph Blog in the near term.  I‚Äôve never gotten so many from a single book ‚Äî that is a strength of reading the ideas in story form.  It can catch your imagination.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookYou don‚Äôt need this book if you are an expert or professional in finance.  You could benefit from this book if you want to improve what you do financially, improve your dealings with your financial advisor, or get a good financial advisor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KOAS4O7AMYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511466154#wasThisHelpful","R7KOAS4O7AMYS","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can a book be largely true, but not be a good book?  By offering people a way to make a lot of money that is hard to do, but portraying it as easy.  It can be done, and a tiny number succeed at it, but most of the rest lose money or don't make much in the process.  This is such a book.Let me illustrate my point with an example.  Toward the end of every real estate bull market, books come out on how easy it is to make money flipping homes.  The books must sell to some degree or the publishers wouldn't publish them.  Few actually succeed at it because:* It's a lot of work* It's competitive* It only works well when you have a bunch of people who are uneducated about the value of their homes and are willing to sell them to you cheap, and/or offer you cheap financing while you reposition it.* Transaction costs are significant, and improvements don't always pay back what you put in.You could make a lot of money at it, but it is unlikely.  Now with this book, ""100 to 1 in the Stock Market,"" the value proposition is a little different:* Find one company that will experience stunning compound growth over 20-30+ years.* Invest heavily in it, and don't diversify into a lot of other stocks, because that will dilute your returns.* Hold onto it, and don't sell any ever, ever, ever!  (Forget Lord Rothschild, who said the secret to his wealth was that he always sold too soon.)* Learn to mention the company name idly in passing, and happily live off of the dividends, should there be any. ;)Here are the problems.  First, identifying the stock will be tough.  Less than 1% of all stocks do that.  Are you feeling lucky?  How lucky?  That lucky?  Wow.Second, most people will pick a dog of a stock, and lose a lot of money.  If you aren't aware, more than half of all stocks lose money if held for a long time.  Most of the rest perform meh.  Even if you pick a stock you think has a lot of growth potential, there is often a lot of competition.  Will this be the one to survive?  Will some new technology obsolete this?  Will financing be adequate to let the plan get to fruition without a lot of dilution of value to stockholders.Third, most people can't buy and hold a single stock, even if it is doing really well.  Most succumb to the temptation to take profits, especially when the company hits a rough patch, and all companies hit rough patches, non excepted.Fourth, when you do tell friends about how smart you are, they will try to dissuade you from your position.  So will the financial media, even me sometimes.  As Cramer says, ""the bear case always sounds more intelligent.""  Beyond that, never underestimate envy. :(But suppose even after reading this, you still want to be a home run hitter, and will settle for nothing less.  Is this the book for you?  Yes.  it will tell you what sorts of stocks appreciate by 100 times or more, even if finding them will still be rough.This book was written in 1972, so it did not have the benefit of Charlie Munger's insights into the ""Lollapalooza"" effect.  What does it take for a stock to compound so much?* It needs a sustainable competitive advantage.  The company has to have something critical that would be almost impossible for another firm to replicate or obsolete.* It needs a very competent management team that is honest, and shareholder oriented, not self-oriented.* They have to have a balance sheet capable of funding growth, and avoiding crashing in downturns, while rarely issuing additional shares.* It has to earn a high return on capital deployed.* It has to be able to reinvest earnings such that they earn a high return in the business over a long period of time.* That means the opportunity has to be big, and can spread like wildfire.* Finally, it implies that not a lot of cash flow needs to be used to maintain the investments that the company makes, leaving more money to invest in new assets.You would need most if not all of these in order to compound capital 100 times.  That's hard.  Very hard.Now if you want a lighter version of this, a reasonable alternative, look at some of the books that Peter Lynch wrote, where he looked to compound investments 10 times or more.  Ten-baggers, he called them.  Same principles apply, but he did it in the context of a diversified portfolio.  That is still very tough to do, but something that mere mortals could try, and even if you don't succeed, you won't lose a ton in the process.One Up On Wall Street: How To Use What You Already Know To Make Money In The MarketBeating the StreetQuibblesAlready given.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookYou can buy this book to enjoy the good writing, and learn about past investments that did incredibly well.

"Some books are better in concept than they are in execution.  Ironically, that is true of ‚ÄúThe Art of Execution.‚ÄùThe core idea of the book is that most great investors get more stocks wrong than they get right, but they make money because they let their winners run, and either cut their losses short or reinvest in their losers at much lower prices than their initial purchase price.  From that, the author gets the idea that the buy and sell disciplines of the investors are the main key to their success.I know this is a book review, and book reviews are not supposed to be about me.  I include the next two paragraphs to explain why I think the author is wrong, at least in the eyes of most investment managers that I know.From my practical experience as an investment manager, I can tell you that your strategy for buying and selling is a part of the investment process, but it is not the main one.  Like the author, I also have hired managers to run a billion-plus dollars of money for a series of multiple manager funds.  I did it for the pension division of mutual life insurer that no longer exists back in the 1990s.  It was an interesting time in my career, and I never got the opportunity again.  In the process, I interviewed a large number of the top long-only money managers in the US.  Idea generation was the core concept for almost all of the managers.  Many talked about their buy disciplines at length, but not as a concept separate from the hardest part of being a manager ‚Äî finding the right assets to buy.Sell disciplines received far less emphasis, and for most managers, were kind of an afterthought.  If you have good ideas, selling assets is an easy thing ‚Äî if your ideas aren‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs hard.  But then you wouldn‚Äôt be getting a lot of assets to manage, so it wouldn‚Äôt matter much.Much of the analysis of the author stems from the way he had managers run money for him ‚Äî he asked them to invest on in their ten best ideas.  That‚Äôs a concentrated portfolio indeed, and makes sense if you are almost certain in your analysis of the stocks that you invest in.  As such, the book spends a lot of time on how the managers traded single ideas as separate from the management of the portfolio as a whole.  As such, a number of examples that he brought out as bad management by one set of managers sound really bad, until you realize one thing: they were all part of a broader portfolio.  As managers, they might not have made significant adjustments to a losing position because they were occupied with other more consequential positions that were doing better.  After all, losses on a stock are capped at 100%, while gains are theoretically infinite.  As a stock falls in price, if you don‚Äôt add to the position, the risk to the portfolio as a whole gets less and less.Thus, as you read through the book, you get a collection of anecdotes to illustrate good and bad position and money management.  Any one of these might sound bright or dumb, but they don‚Äôt mean a lot if the rest of the portfolio is doing something different.This is a short book.  The pages are small, and white space is liberally interspersed.  If this had been a regular-sized book, with white space reduced, it might have taken up 80-90 pages.  There‚Äôs not a lot here, and given the anecdotal nature of what was written, it is not much more than the author‚Äôs opinions.  (There are three pages citing an academic paper, but they exist as an afterthought in a chapter on one class of investors. It has the unsurprising result that positions that managers weight heavily do better than those with lower weights.)  As such, I don‚Äôt recommend the book, and I can‚Äôt think of a subset of people that could benefit from it, aside from managers that want to be employed by this guy, in order to butter him up.QuibblesThe end of the book mentions liquidity as a positive factor in asset selection, but most research on the topic gives a premium return to illiquid stocks.  Also, if the manager has concentrated positions in the stocks that he owns, his positions will prove to be less liquid than less concentrated positions in stocks with similar tradable float.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookDon‚Äôt buy this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HMX24KI2C6WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=085719495X#wasThisHelpful","R3HMX24KI2C6WV","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am generally not a fan of formulaic books on investing, and this is particularly true of books that take unusual approaches to investing. This book is an exception because it does nothing unusual, and follows what all good quantitative investors know have worked in the past.  The past is not a guarantee of the future, but if the theories derived from past data make sense from what we know about human nature, that‚Äôs about as good as we can get.The book begins with a critique of the abilities of financial advisors ‚Äî their fees, asset allocation, and security selection.  It then shows how models of financial markets outperform most financial advisors.Then, to live up to its title , the book gives simple versions of models that can be applied by individuals that would have outperformed the markets in the past.  You can beat the markets, lower risk, and ‚ÄúDo It Yourself [DIY].‚Äù  It provides models for asset allocation, stock selection, and risk control, simple enough that a motivated person with math skills equal to the first half of Algebra 1 could apply them in a moderate amount of time per month.  It also provides a simpler version of the full model that omits the security selection for stocks.The book closes by offering three reasons why people won‚Äôt follow the book and do it themselves: fear of failure, inertia, and not wanting to give up an advisor who is a friend.  It also offers three risks for the DIY investor ‚Äî overconfidence, the desire to be a hero (seems to overlap with overconfidence), and that the theories may be insufficient for future market behavior.This is where I have the greatest disagreement with the book.  I interact with a lot of people.  Most of them have no interest in learning the slightest bit about investing.  Some have some inclination to learn about investing, but even the simple models of the book would make their heads spin, or they just wouldn‚Äôt want to take the time to do it.  Some of it is similar to seeing a Youtube video on draining and refilling your automatic transmission fluid.  You might watch it, and say ‚ÄúI think I get it,‚Äù but the costs of making a mistake are sufficiently severe that you might not want to do it without an expert by your side.  Most will take it to the repair garage and pay up.I put a knife to my own throat as I write this, as I am an investment advisor, but there is more specialized knowledge in the hands of an auto mechanic than in an investment advisor, and the risk of loss is lower to manage your own money than to fix your own brakes.  That said, enough people after reading the book will say to themselves, ‚ÄúThis is just one author, and I barely understand the performance tables in the book ‚Äî if right, am I capable of doing this?  Or, could it be wrong?  I can‚Äôt verify it myself.‚ÄùThe book isn‚Äôt wrong.  If you are willing to put in the time to follow the instructions of the authors, I think you will do better than most.  My sense is that the grand majority people are not willing to do that.  They don‚Äôt have the time or inclination.QuibblesThe book could have been clearer on the ROBUST method for risk control.  It took me a bit of effort to figure out that the two submodels share half of the weight, so that when submodels A & B flash green ‚Äî 100% weight, one green and one red ‚Äî 50% weight, both red ‚Äî 0% weight.Also, the book is enhanced by the security selection model for stocks, but how many people would have the assets to assemble and maintain a portfolio with sufficient diversification?  The book might have been cleaner and simpler to leave that out.  The last models of the book don‚Äôt use it anyway.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookI liked this book, and I recommend it for those who are willing to put in the time to implement its ideas.  This is not a book for beginners, and you have to be comfortable with the small amount of math and the tables of financial statistics, unless you are willing to trust them blindly.  (Or trust me when I say that they are likely accurate.)But with the caveats listed above, it is a good book for people who are motivated to do better with their investments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMMB1STTGHHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111907150X#wasThisHelpful","R2PMMB1STTGHHR","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can you explain to a non-technical reader how software works?  It depends on what you mean by ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù and ‚Äúexplain.‚ÄùWith respect to software, this particular book focuses on a few areas that are hot today, and not computing in general. Take a look at the following list.  What would it be like to not have the following technologies?Graphic display, both for pictures and videoSecurity ‚Äî whether in the form of passwords, encryption, including public key cryptographyData compression techniques to reduce the amount of data sent, whether for text, pictures, or videoWeb SearchMaps that help us find the most efficient driving routeConcurrency ‚Äî allowing multiple parties to use the same application at the same timeThe web and the internet generally would be a dramatically different place, and much smaller, as it was in 1990 slightly after Tim Berners-Lee created HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).The topics here are important and affect our daily lives.  The author of ‚ÄúHow Software Works‚Äù makes a significant effort to explain programming in a way that teenagers and adults could understand, using pictures, tables, flowcharts, simplified numerical examples, and more.Now, reading this book will give you a top-level view of how these technologies work, but not much more.  It will help you understand some of the tradeoffs that go on in computing.  How do you balance:Richness of data delivered versus resource use and speed of display.Security versus ease of useReduction of size of data versus loss of fidelity in an image or videoAnd more, there are a lot of tradeoffs in programming.The ideal audience for this book is bright adults who aren‚Äôt programmers, but want some appreciation of the hidden complexity behind much of what goes on on the internet.  The second ideal audience would be teenagers and young adults who might want a career in computer science, who might benefit from exposure to these varied areas of software.  Who knows?  One area might catch their fancy, and then they can study it for real, and put it into practice.  (I‚Äôm giving this book to my second daughter who is interested in programming.)QuibblesOn page 39, the author suggests that there is no way to do square roots, that it is just a guesswork procedure.  There are algorithms to do square roots ‚Äî whether those are used in computing, I don‚Äôt know, but it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to implement.  I was doing it when I was 10.

"Note for those reading at Amazon: links to external resources are available at my blog.Liquidity is ephemeral, and difficult to define.  The first real article at my blog was about liquidity, and the three things that liquidity can mean, notably: the ability to:* Enter into large or exit from commitments to risk assets cheaply (cost)* Borrow at tight credit spreads compared to the safest borrowers* Make large adjustments to their asset allocations rapidly (speed)Most of these phenomena can be observed without complex models.  Ask yourself:* Is credit growing rapidly?* Are the exchanges moving turning over stocks more rapidly?* Are credit spreads tight?* Have credit terms and conditions deteriorated?* Do lenders care more about volume of lending than quality of lending?My bias is that I think most of the academic mathematical models of liquidity risk are overly technical, and tend to obscure liquidity conditions rather than reveal what is going on.  Unless you disagree with that view and you like math, this book will not be worth a lot to you.  Yes, there are qualitative sections, and they are good.  For example, the beginning of chapter 2 is very good at illustrating the paradoxical nature of liquidity.  Chapters 1-3 would have made a very good qualitative monograph on liquidity ‚Äî but it would be so small that you couldn‚Äôt charge $80+ for it.Chapters 4-6 will only be useful to the mathematically inclined.  I‚Äôm dubious that they even be useful then, because much of it is calculus, which does not do well with discontinuous events such as market panics.  (You would have thought that the quants on Wall Street would have learned by now, but no‚Ä¶)  Even if the models did work, there are simpler ways to see the same things, as I pointed out above.As such, I really can‚Äôt recommend the book, and at $80+ the price is a lot more expensive than the free Monograph from the CFA Institute ‚ÄúThe New Economics of Liquidity and Financial Frictions.‚Äù [PDF]  Read that, not this, and save liquidity.QuibblesThe book could have used a better editor.

"(Note to readers at Amazon -- links are available at my blog.  Wish Amazon would let me post them here.This book is written by an interesting man about another interesting man.  Tren Griffin writes a respectable blog called 25iq.  His main topics are the theory of value investing, and what he has learned from bright investors and businessmen.  One of his favorite businessmen/investors that he likes studying is Charlie Munger, and that‚Äôs why he wrote the book.Why is Tren Griffin interesting, aside from his writing?  Well, he solved a practical problem of his own once using the ideas of Munger and Buffett.  As an executive at Microsoft, he had a large block of Microsoft stock during the dot-com bubble.  His dilemma: should he sell his stock or not?  After reading Munger particularly, he came up with a solution that I would endorse: he sold half of his holdings.  A lot of good investing is getting around psychological barriers so that you are happy with your results, and be able to sleep well at night.  Selling half is never the optimal solution, but it is a good one amid uncertainty, and allows you to stop sitting on your hands amid danger.A lot of what goes into the thought processes of Charlie Munger involves how investors let fear or greed get the better of them, and cease to think rationally.  Learning these foibles has two advantages: you can try to train yourself to avoid these problems, and take advantage of the irrationality of others in business and investing.In his book, Tren Griffin takes you through Munger‚Äôs thoughts on Value Investing.  Particularly interesting to me was how the concept of Margin of Safety changed, and what role Munger played in its development.  The key change was noting that businesses differ in quality, especially as to how long they can maintain above average returns on their invested capital, and how much of their profits would be free to be reinvested in the business.  An ideal business would be a natural monopoly with a high return on capital, and a need for continued capital investment somewhat less than its profits.Tren Griffin also introduces you to the mental models of Munger.  Strong generalist knowledge in a wide number of areas can aid making business and investment decisions.  One drawback is that many of the mental models are clear and adequately described ‚Äî the ones on human psychology.  The rest are more vague, and seem to be what a true liberal arts education should be, including math and science.  Munger is a lifelong learner, and given how much the world changes, if you want to be competitive, you have to continually update your knowledge.For those who are familiar with the way that Munger thinks, this is old hat.  But for those that are new to it, this book is an excellent introduction, and is systematic in a slim 150+ small pages of information.  On that basis, I recommend the book strongly.But, if you‚Äôre still not sure whether you would like the book or not, or whether it would be a good book for a friend of yours, you have an easy way to help you decide.  Just visit the author‚Äôs blog, and look at the topics page.  Scroll down and find the topic ‚ÄúCharlie Munger.‚Äù  Of the nine articles presently there, pick two of them and read them.  If you like them, you will like the book.QuibblesFrom my past dealings with authors, I know they don‚Äôt always control the title of the book, but this book is half about Munger and half about value investing generally, particularly the version of value investing practiced at Berkshire Hathaway.  There are ample quotations from Buffett and other value investors along with more from Munger.  If I had been structuring the book, I would have made it entirely about Munger, and might have included a biography if the book had not been long enough.The appendices are a good example of that, in that they are less about what Munger thinks, and more about the way Berkshire Hathaway views value investing.  The last appendix doesn‚Äôt seem to mention Munger at all.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookIf you‚Äôve read a lot of Munger, this book will likely not benefit you.  If you are new to the thoughts of Charlie Munger, or want aid in clarifying his thoughts into a system, this book will help do that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4YRRYGTXDNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EB3EUM#wasThisHelpful","R3P4YRRYGTXDNL","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story of triumph and tragedy.  Jesse Livermore is notable as one of the few people who ever made it into the richest tiers of society by speculating ‚Äî by trading stocks and commodities ‚Äî betting on price movements.This is three stories in one.  Story one is the clever trader with an intuitive knack who learned to adapt when conditions changed, until the day came when it got too hard.  Story two is the man who lacked financial risk control, and took big chances, a few of which worked out spectacularly, and a few of ruined him financially.  Story three is how too much success, if not properly handled, can ruin a man, with lust, greed and pride leading to his death.The author spends most of his time on story one, next most on story two, then the least on story three.  The three stories flow naturally from the narrative that is largely chronological.  By the end of the book, you see Jesse Livermore ‚Äî a guy who did amazing things, but ultimately failed in money and life.Let me briefly summarize those three aspects of his life so that you can get a feel for what you will run into in the book:The Clever TraderJesse Livermore came to the stock market in Boston at age 14, and was a very quick study.  He showed intuition on market affairs that impressed the most of the older men who came to trade at the brokerage where he worked.  It wasn‚Äôt too long before he wanted to invest for himself, but he didn‚Äôt have enough money to open a brokerage account, so he went to a bucket shop.  Bucket shops were gambling parlors where small players gambled on stock prices.  He showed a knack for the game and made a lot of money.  Like someone who beats the casinos in Vegas, the proprietors forced him to leave.He then had more than enough money to meet his current needs, and set up a brokerage account.  But the stock market did not behave like a bucket shop, and so he lost money while he learned to adapt.  Eventually, he succeeded at speculating on both stocks and commodities, leading to his greatest successes in being short the stock market prior to the panic of 1907, and the crash in 1929.  During the 1920s, he started his own firm to try to institutionalize his gifts, and it worked for much of the era.After the crash in 1929, the creation of the SEC and all the associated laws and regulations made speculating a lot more difficult, to the point where he could not make significant money speculating anymore.The Poor Financial Risk ManagerAmid the successes, he tended to aim for greater wins after his largest successes, which led to him losing much of what he had previously made.  One time he was cheated out of much of what he had while trading cotton.Amid all of that, he was well-liked by most he interacted with in a business context.  Even after great losses, many wanted him to succeed again, and so they bankrolled him after failure.  Before the Great Depression, he did not disappoint them ‚Äî he succeeded in speculation and came roaring back, repaying all of his past debts with interest.In one sense, it was live by the big speculation, and die by the big speculation.  When you play with so much borrowed money, it‚Äôs hard for results to not be volatile.A Rock Star of His EraWhen he won big, he lived big.  Compared to many wealthy people of his era, he let spending expand far more than many who had  more reliable sources of income.  Where did the money go?  Yachts, homes, staff, wives, women, women, women‚Ä¶  Aside from the last of his three wives, his marriages were troubled.His last wife was a nice woman who was independently wealthy, and after Livermore lost it all in the mid-‚Äô30s, he increasingly relied on her to stay afloat.  When he could no longer be the hero who could win a good living out of the market via speculation, his deflated pride led him to commit suicide in 1940.A Sad Book Amid Amazing SuccessesSadly, his son and grandson who shared his name committed suicide in 1975 and 2006, respectively.  On the whole, the story of Jesse Livermore‚Äôs life and legacy is a sad one.  It should disabuse people of the notion that wealth brings happiness.  If anything, it teaches that money that comes too easily tends to get lost easily also.The author does a good job weaving the strands of his life into a consistent whole.  The book is well-written, and probably the best book out there on the life of the famous speculator that so many present speculators admire.  A side benefit is that in passing, you will learn a lot about the development of the markets during a time when they were less regulated.  (The volatility of markets was obvious then.  It not obvious now, which is why people get surprised by it when it explodes.)QuibblesNone.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookThis is a comprehensive book that explains the life and times of Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators in history.  It will teach you history, but it won‚Äôt teach you how to speculate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHG77P00GFZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990619915#wasThisHelpful","R1KHG77P00GFZZ","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suppose you wanted a comprehensive book on all of the ways that there are to get excess returns from the stock market as a type of value investor (as of year-end 2013), and you wanted it in one slim volume.  This is that book.  As with most desires there is the ‚Äúbe careful what you wish for, you just might get it‚Äù effect.  This book is not immune.At Aleph Blog, I try to write book reviews that always include what sort of reader might benefit from a given book.  Because this book packs so much into such a small space, it is not a book for beginners unless they are prodigies.  If you are a beginner, better to warm up with something like The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham.  Beginners need time to see concepts described in greater detail, and more slowly.Though it is a book on value investing, it is expansive in what it considers value investing.  It includes topics as varied as:* Behavioral Economics* Market-timing from a valuation standpoint* Growth at a reasonable price [GARP] investing* Private investing* Shorting* Event-driven investing* Barriers to considering investments that keep others from buying them at attractive prices* Studying informed investors (insiders & 13F filings)* Catalysts that may unlock value* Emerging markets* Financial statements* Competitive Analysis* Analyzing Growth Potential* Analyzing Management* Valuation techniques* Common mistakes; why most average investors go wrong* Understanding different types of industries and companies* Attitudes ‚Äî Modesty, Patience & Independent Judgement* And more‚Ä¶In a book of around 300 pages, this is ambitious.  It gives you one or two passes over important topics, so you are only getting a taste of the ideas involved.  This is also predominantly a book on qualitative investing.  Pure quantitative value investing doesn‚Äôt get much play.  Non-value anomalies don‚Äôt get much coverage.The other thing the book lacks is a way to pull it all together in a practical way.  Yes, the last chapter tries to pull it all together, but given the breadth of the material, it gets pulled together in terms of the attitudes you need to do this right, but less of a ‚Äúhow do you structure an overall investment process to put these principles into practical action.‚Äù  Providing more examples could have been useful, and really, the whole book could have benefited from that.Additional ResourcesNow, if you want a greater taste of the book without buying it, I‚Äôve got a deal for you: this is a medium-sized slide presentation that summarizes the book.

"I made it through this book while watching my daughter at a softball tryout.  It was an overly easy read, because there is little in the book.  For each of the 50 characters in the book, you get around 1.5 pages of text.  An average article at Aleph Blog would be the length of 2-3 biographical vignettes contained in this book.  At most, you learn the highest points of their lives.But, I have other criticisms:* You don‚Äôt even necessarily get the highest points of their lives.  I read through a few of them and thought I could have done a better job summarizing their lives with one hour of time.*Many of the characters don‚Äôt deserve to be in the book.  Some aren‚Äôt important or colorful enough.  Others are too recent to evaluate how truly ‚Äúcolorful‚Äù or important they are.  Others aren‚Äôt truly in finance ‚Äî they may be in business, politics, or academic economics, but they had little to do with finance in any direct way.* Occasionally, there are factual errors, such as with Nick Leeson, where it attributes his famous ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry,‚Äù note to February 1994 (twice), while having him flee one year later in 1995.  Both happened in February 1995.This book is bad enough that the author should be absolved from blame, and that the editors and anyone else in the approval process at Wiley should receive it.  This book should never have seen the light of day in its present form.  Wiley‚Äôs quality control is usually quite good ‚Äî something went awry here.Now, lest this be purely negative, I have two ideas.  Simple idea one: go buy Kenneth Fisher‚Äôs 100 Minds that Made the Market.  This is the book that Heroes & Villains of Finance should be.  As I say in my review:""Some people are hard to buy gifts for.  With books, there is often a trade-off between books that say a lot, and those that people are willing to read.  One book that I think hits the sweet spot is 100 Minds That Made The Market, by Ken Fisher.Why do I think this?  This book is 100 little books in one volume.  You can pick this book up for five minutes, and read a well-written 3-4 page biography of person who has had a significant impact on how our markets work today.  Then you can put it down, get back to work, and think that you have learned something significant.""So if you want a book of short biographies, this is a better one.  I think it makes an excellent gift.Idea number two, for the folks at Wiley ‚Äî here‚Äôs a book that could sell: [20-50] Greatest Financial Scandals Ever.  Average people aren‚Äôt looking for heroes in finance.  It‚Äôs not that there aren‚Äôt any.  It‚Äôs just that the scoundrels are far more interesting to read about.  Finance, when done right, is boring.  Margin of safety, low debt, ethical management, etc‚Ä¶ good to learn from, but won‚Äôt tell interesting stories to the same degree.I would encourage the author to take it one step further as well: add a final chapter to give the common themes that run through the scandals.  Books like Heroes & Villains of Finance leave you with no generality at the end ‚Äî is there some common thread behind heroes?  What of villains?  Are there lessons to be drawn here from the sum total of the lives considered?SummaryDon‚Äôt buy Heroes and Villains of Finance.

"This is a difficult book to review.  Let me tell you what it is not, and then let me tell you what it is more easily as a result.1) The book does not give you detailed biographies of the people that it features.  Indeed, the writing on each person is less than the amount that Ken Fisher wrote in his book, 100 Minds That Made the Market.  If you are looking for detailed biographical sketches, you will be disappointed.2) The book does not give detailed and comparable reviews of the portfolio performance of those that it features.  There‚Äôs no way from what is written to tell really how good many of the investors are.  I mean, I would want to see dollar-weighted rates of return, and perhaps, measures of dollar alpha.  The truly best managers have expansive strategies that can perform well managing a large amount of money.3) The book admits that the managers selected may not be the greatest, but are some of the ‚Äúgreats.‚Äù  Okay, fair enough, but I would argue that a few of the managers don‚Äôt deserve to be featured even as that if you review their dollar-weighted performance.  A few of them showed that they did not pay adequate attention to margin of safety in the recent financial crisis, and lost a lot of money for people at the time that they should have been the most careful.4) If you wanted to understand the strategies of the managers, this is not the book for you.  They are not described, except in the broadest terms.5) There is no integration of any common themes of what makes an investment manager great.  You don‚Äôt get a necklace; you just get a jar of pretty, non-comparable beads that don‚Äôt have any holes in them.What do you get in this book?  You get beautiful black and white photos of 33 managers, and vignettes of each of them written by six authors.  The author writes two-thirds of the vignettes.Do I recommend this book?  Yes, if you understand what it is good for.  It is a well-done coffee table book on thick glossy paper, with truly beautiful photographs. It is well-suited for people waiting in a reception area, who want to read something light and short about several notable investment managers.But if you are looking for anything involved in my five points above, you will not be satisfied by this book.One final note on the side ‚Äî I would have somehow reworked the layout of Bill Miller‚Äôs photograph.  Splitting his face down the middle of the gutter does not represent him to be the handsome guy that he is.(To those reading at Amazon, the article at Aleph Blog has useful links to help elucidate concepts in the review.

"This book has two significant types of insights: on people and on market failure.  It does well with both of them, but spends most of its time on the former, because it is more interesting.  That said, the second set is more important, and is buried in a few places in the second half of the book.With people, this book answers the following questions:* Why does this book largely take place in Buffalo, NY? Because entrepreneurs got started there, and found it easy to acquire talent there.* Why does the industry employ a lot of ex-convicts? There are some crossover benefits to having been through the rough-and-tumble of street life that gives an edge in dealing with desperate people who have bad debts.* Is there an ethical code for debt collectors? Well, yes, sort of.  Kind of like ‚Äúthe code‚Äù from the movie Repo Man ‚Äì don‚Äôt tell debtors they are in legal trouble, don‚Äôt threaten, treat them with kindness, don‚Äôt buy debt where you don‚Äôt have a clear chain of title, don‚Äôt sell lists of debts to collect where the debtors have already been verbally flogged.* Do all debt collectors follow the code? Well, no, and that is one place where the book gets interesting, as various debt collectors look for edges so that they can make money off of debts that creditors have given up on.  There *is* honor among thieves, and be careful if you cross anyone powerful or desperate enough.* Can‚Äôt you use the legal system to try to recover money on the debts? Well, only at the end, and even then it is difficult, because if the debtor asks for evidence on the debt that is being collected, the debt collector usually doesn‚Äôt have it, and the case will be dismissed.  It is best for collectors to come to settlements out of court.The book follows around debt collectors and those associated with them, a colorful bunch, who see their see their opportunities flow and ebb as the financial crisis first produces a lot of bad debts to work on, and they mine that ore until the yields get poor.  Some of these people you will gain sympathy for, as they are trying to make a buck ethically.  Others will turn you off with their conduct.As for market failure issues, you might wonder why the credit card companies and other creditors don‚Äôt pursue the debtors themselves.  Why do they sell the right to collect on unsecured debts at such deep discounts to the face value of the debts? [Pennies on the dollar, or less‚Ä¶]The creditors don‚Äôt want to make the effort to dig up the necessary data to make the case in court a slam-dunk.  It would not pay for them to do so in most cases given the large number of cases to pursue, and the relatively small amounts that would be recovered.  That‚Äôs why the debts are sold at a discount.Some debts don‚Äôt get removed from databases when payments are made to close them out, and as such some debt collectors try to collect on debts that were once in default, but paid off in a compromise.  This could be remedied if there were a comprehensive database of all debts, but the costs of creating and updating such a database would likely be prohibitive.Finally, you might ask where the regulators are in all of this.  Between the States and the Feds, they try to clip the worst aspects of debt collection, but they are stretched thin.  This means that for many people, the optimal strategy is not to pay on defaulted unsecured debts, and challenge them if they take you to court.QuibblesLots of foul language, but you‚Äôre dealing with the lowest rungs of society, so what do you expect?Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookThis is a good book if you want to understand the unsecured debt collection business.  If you have friends who are troubled by debt collectors, it might be worth a purchase, and lend the book to them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTH6Y4OOHDIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6TUZFG#wasThisHelpful","R2QTH6Y4OOHDIW","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: links are available at the Aleph Blog)It‚Äôs time to change what Warren Buffett supposedly said about his mentors:‚ÄúI‚Äôm 85% Ben Graham, and 15% Phil Fisher.‚ÄùFor those who don‚Äôt know, Ben Graham is regarded to be the father of value investing, and Phil Fisher the father of growth investing.  Trouble is, Warren Buffett changed in his career such that this is no longer accurate.  Most of Buffett‚Äôs economic activity does not stem from buying and selling portions of public companies, but by buying and managing whole companies.  Buffett is the manager of a conglomerate that uses insurance reserves as a funding vehicle.As a result, this would be more accurate about the modern Buffett:Buffett is 70% Henry Singleton, 15% Ben Graham, and 15% Phil Fisher.Henry Singleton was the CEO of Teledyne, a very successful conglomerate, and one of the few to do well over a long period of time.  It is very difficult to manage a conglomerate, but Teledyne survived for around 40 years, and was very profitable.  Buffett thought highly of Singleton as a allocator of capital, though the conglomerate that Buffett created is very different than Teledyne.Tonight, I am reviewing a book that describes Buffett as a manager of a special conglomerate called Berkshire Hathaway [BRK] ‚Äî Berkshire Beyond Buffett.  This Buffett book is different, because it deals with the guts of how Buffett created BRK the company, and not the typical and misleading Buffett as a value investor.Before I go on, here are three articles that could prove useful for background:* Buffett‚Äôs Career in Less Than 1000 Words, and* The Forever Fund ‚Äî deals with the Burlington Northern Acquisition, and Buffett‚Äôs efforts to create a firm that will thrive long after he is gone.* On the Structure of Berkshire Hathaway ‚Äî describes how the insurance enterprises, particularly National Indemnity, own and fund many of the industrial subsidiaries.The main point of Berkshire Beyond Buffett is that Buffett has created a company that operates without his detailed oversight.  As a result, when Buffett dies, BRK should be able to continue on without him and do well.  The author attributes that to the ethical values that Buffett has selected for when acquiring companies.  He manages to cram those values into an acronym BERKSHIRE.I won‚Äôt spoil the acronym, but it boils down to a few key ideas:1. Do you have subsidiary managers who are competent, ethical, and love nothing better than running the business?  Do they act as if they are the sole proprietors of the business, and act only to maximize its long-term value consistent with its corporate culture?  These are the ideal managers of BRK subsidiaries.2. Acquiring such companies often comes about because a founder or significant builder of the company is getting old, and there are family, succession, taxation, funding or other issues that being a part of BRK would solve, allowing the management team to focus on running the business.3. Do the businesses have sustainable competitive advantages in markets that are likely to be relevant several generations from now?The beauty of a company coming under the Berkshire umbrella is that Buffett leaves the culture alone, and so long as the company is producing its profits well, he continues to leave them alone.  Thus, the one selling a company to Buffett gets the benefit of knowing that the people and culture of the company will not change.  In exchange, Buffett does not pay top dollar, but gets deals done faster than almost anyone else.This is a very good book, and its greatest strength is that it talks about Berkshire Hathaway the company as built by Buffett to endure.  If you want to understand Buffett‚Äôs corporate strategy, it is described ably here.QuibblesNow, my three ideas above *might* have been a better way to organize the book, rather than the hokey BERKSHIRE.  Also, a lot more could have been done with the insurance enterprises of BRK, which are a critical aspect of how the company owns and finances many of the other subsidiaries.But will BRK do so well without Buffett?  Yes, his loyal son Howard will guard the culture.  The Board is loyal to the ethos that Buffett has created.  Ted Weschler and Todd Combs will continue to invest the public money.  The all-star subsidiary managers will soldier on, at least in the short-run.But will the new CEO be the person that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to disappoint,‚Äù as some subsidiary managers think of Buffett?  As a result, how will BRK deal with underperformers?  What new structures will they set up?  Tracy Britt Cool is smart, but will BRK need many like her, and how will they be organized?Will he be a great capital allocator?  Will he maintain the ‚Äúhands off‚Äù policy toward the culture of subsidiaries, or will the day come when some centralization takes place to save money?Will Buffett‚Äôs replacement be equally intuitive with respect to acquisition prices, and sustainable competitive advantage?Buffett‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî he has had his share of errors with textiles, shoe companies, airlines, Energy Future, and a variety of other investments, but his record will be tough to match, even if replaced by a team of clever people.  Say what you will, but teams are not as decisive as a single manager, and that may be a future liability of BRK.Summary / Who Would Benefit from this BookMost people will not benefit from this book if they are looking for a way to make more money in their life.  There are no magic ways to apply the insights of the book for quick gains.  Also, readers are unlikely to use Buffett‚Äôs ‚Äúhands off‚Äù methods in building their own conglomerate.  But readers will benefit because they will get to consider the building of the BRK enterprise from the basic principles involved.  There will be indirect benefits as they analyze other business situations, perhaps using BRK as a counterexample ‚Äî a different way to acquire and run a large enterprise.But as for getting any direct benefit from the book? There‚Äôs probably not much, but you will understand business better at the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FM6JX4M9FGKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231170041#wasThisHelpful","R2FM6JX4M9FGKJ","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over time, I have reviewed a decent number of ""Little Books.""  I have a theory as to why I like some of them, and not others.  I like the ones that take a relatively narrow concept and summarize it.  An example of that would be Mark Mobius' book on emerging markets, or Vitaliy Katsenelson's book on sideways markets.But when a concept is broad and not friendly to summary, a ""little book"" is not so useful.  As examples, John Mauldin's book on Bulls Eye  Investing went too many directions, and Scaramucci on Hedge Funds could not adequately summarize or describe a large topic.There are other ""Little Books"" that I have read that did not even get a review... probably about 10% of the books I read in entire never get the review written because they were so bad, or just hard to decide what the book was.  (What do you want to be if you grow up dear? ;) )Sorry, too much intro.  For those at Amazon, there are useful links at my blog.Jack Schwager is generally a good writer, and expert at talking with clever investors in order to break down the main points of how they invest (without giving away the store).  In this ""Little Book"" he goes a different direction, and looks for commonalities among various clever investors, with each chapter covering a different topic.My view is that most clever investors fall into one of a bunch of categories, much of which boils down to time horizon for the preferred investment.  Going down the continuum: day trader, swing trader, longer-term trader, momentum-oriented growth investor, growth investor, growth-at-a-reasonable-price investor, and value investor.  After that, you might differentiate between those that go for relative vs absolute returns.As such, the book posits a bunch of topics that apply to different groups of clever investors.  I think it would have been better to have segmented the book by classes of investors, because then you could have a coherent set of commonalities for each main investor type.As it is, the book relies heavily on anecdotes, which isn't entirely a bad thing; nothing motivates a topic like a story.  But if you were reading this to try to develop your own philosophy of managing money in order to fit your own personality, you might have a hard time doing it with this book.  I think you would be better off reading one of Schwager's longer books, and reading about each clever investor separately.  At least then you get to see the full package for an investor, and how the different aspects of investing in a given style work together.QuibblesAlready expressed.SummaryIf you just want a taste of what a wide variety of different investors do to be effective, this could be the book for you.  For most other people, get one of Schwager's longer books, and read about the different investors as individual chapters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S73I9I6M0OZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118858697#wasThisHelpful","R1S73I9I6M0OZX","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start, I would like to remind readers of a Q&A that I did with the author, which is available here. [For readers at Amazon: Google ""Aleph Education of a Value Investor"". There are other useful links in the version at my blog.  Wish Amazon allowed for links...]This is a good book if you know what you are getting and want that.  If you want a book to compare it to, I would class it with ""Benjamin Graham: The Memoirs of the Dean of Wall Street.""  The reason for this comparison is that the book focuses on character development, and spends relatively little time on detailed value investing methods.  It spends a lot of time on the good parts of the lifestyle of a value investor, and this is where the book has its highest value.Is it possible to ‚Äúget rich quick?‚Äù  I don‚Äôt think so, but it is possible to become rich if you focus, make few decisions, but they are the right actions to take.This book describes the transformation of the author, who went from someone trying to get rich quick in the short-run, and failing, to being an investor who could wait until he had a good idea to invest in, and then concentrate his capital in the best ideas that he had, and succeed.But getting there was not a linear matter.  First, he had to figure out he was miserable.  Then, he had to find a new way to support himself, handicapped because the last firm he worked for had a bad reputation.He picked up an interest in value investing, particularly the style that Buffett follows, which led him to a clutch of contacts in the value investing world who would help to shape his view of the world.Without spoiling the book, some events happened that enabled him to set up his own investment shop where he does value investing for clients and himself.  And as such, he lived happily ever after?Well, not yet.  He meets one key person, Mohnish Pabrai, who helps him think through the key aspects of his business.  He makes a number of additional friends who are value investors, and he figures out what he is good at analyzing and acting on, and where he is less capable.  Armed with that data, he acts to make his entire life more effective for himself, his family, and his clients.He moved so that he could be out of the ‚ÄúNew York Vortex,‚Äù where groupthink can carry you along.  He moved to a quiet area, and set up an office where he could think, and the odds of being disturbed would be low.  He set up an action area and a contemplation area.  He limited electronics to the action area and made it uncomfortable to stay in the action area.  This enabled him to think longer-term, and avoid taking actions because others were doing so.  He also had to learn how to get advice from other intelligent investors, without letting their views short-circuit his thinking processes.He enjoyed life a lot more.  He also realized he had enough assets to manage, and so he didn‚Äôt need to market much, which allowed for a focus on serving current clients well.  About the only thing he needs to do is develop a sell discipline, and that is not an uncommon problem with most asset managers.  [Two of my articles on the topic: one, two.]Near the end of the book, he shares eight pointers that will improve the investing of most people, if they are willing to think long-term.  I endorse the principles there, though there may be other ways to achieve the same disciplined attitude.  He also gives four case studies that affects the checklist that he uses for making investments.Now, I have purposely left out the most colorful part of the book, the lunch with Warren Buffett, to the end of this review.  He and Mohnish bid together for the lunch and win.  The main thing he takes away from the affair was how much Buffett focused on his guests, and not on himself.  Indeed, at the end of the book, he credits his relationship with Mohnish in helping him to become more selfless in many of his attitudes.  To him, that is the real prize, much as he has done well as an investor and a businessman.QuibblesCan all of ethics be summed up as being farsighted and unselfish?  No.  Those are good things, but the Bible has many more things to teach than that.SummaryThis book will help you understand the internal attitudes of some value investors.  It may help you invest to some degree, but that is not the main point of the book.  After all, what is it worth to be a great investor if you aren‚Äôt happy?  Being happy as an investment manager is the main point of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUYNY8NQ47YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137278811#wasThisHelpful","R3RUYNY8NQ47YG","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you like economic history?  I do.  I often think that we spend too much time on the numbers in business, and not enough time on the qualitative reasoning that goes into making good business decisions.This particular book gained some notoriety of late when both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett said they were fans of the book.  Could a book get a more powerful set of recommenders? Unlikely, and as a result, the book was pulled back into print. [Those reading this review at Amazon, there are links at Aleph Blog to flesh this point, and other points out.]The stories are taken from articles written in The New Yorker from the 1960s by John Brooks, who wrote what was one of the best summaries of the markets in the '60s, ""The Go-Go Years.""If you don't like economic history, this will not be the book for you, because the old stories will not resonate, and say to you, ""We never learn.""Consider the wealth of situations covered in the book:1) There was a surprising fall in the market in 1962.  We have experienced much the same with ""flash crashes"" recently.  They had a hard time figuring it out as well.2) There was much work put into testing the Edsel, but it was a flop.  Does that never happen today?  What of New Coke? Various Microsoft products?3) Even in the '50s and '60s there were people looking to convert wage income into less-taxed capital gains income.  The tax code was filled with loopholes.  After a brief tax code cleanup in the mid-'80s, we are back to the same problem today.  Is it any surprise corporations do not manage their businesses for pre-tax economic outcomes?4) Insider trading scandals are nothing new; we just dress them up in new clothes each decade.  Watch the fun as an oil company delays the release of what a gusher they have drilled, while employees/friends take positions.  And, to no surprise, there are different legal results as different parties knew differing amounts on how certain the information was.5) New technology?  Something so big that the name of the company becomes the generic name for the product?  Where they set up a center for research in areas not directly related to their main business?  Google!  Okay, Xerox...  (At least Google is trying to profit from their innovations.)  How does a company manage to avoid becoming trapped in one area of technology?  Well, it didn't work for Xerox, but maybe modern companies can avoid the same problem.6) Can financial companies rescue a fellow company to protect the good reputation of the industry?  In this case they did, but did Wall Street retain the knowledge for the future?  LTCM was saved, though Bear Stearns didn't do its part.  Wonder if that eventually cost them?  How many companies were rescued by fellow companies during the recent financial crisis?  A bunch, and some that should not have been rescued.  And some like Lehman Brothers, that were too big to be privately rescued...7) Price fixing?  Collusion?  Management teams that neglect oversight of employees until they are caught doing something wrong, and then cut the employees free [fire them] while management survives with nary a bruise?  This never happens today, right?  If nothing else, companies should have seen that bigness causes its own set of problems -- how do you create an ethical culture across a large organization?8 ) Or consider the story of Piggly-Wiggly, where the founder squeezed the shorts trying to manipulate his company's stock, only to take on so much debt in the rescue that eventually he had to declare bankruptcy.  Though the occasions are different, think of many companies that took on too much debt to go private over the last 30 years.9) What does a man do after a long time in public service?  Many go into business, and for a timely example, think of Eric Cantor joining Moelis.  Does it have to corrupt the former politician or bureaucrat?  No, but it will change you at minimum.10) There were many angling for corporate governance reform in the '60s.  This is still a live issue today with ""say on pay,"" voting rules on directors, shareholder proposals, splitting the role of CEO and Chairman, etc.  Corporate power is undiminished.  Do shareholders own the company, or does management?  Who do the directors care about more?11) A clever knowledge worker knows a great deal about how a given product is made.  Can he take work at a competing firm?  There are many today who fight back against employment agreements, alleging ""restraint of trade.""  This is not a new problem.12) How do central banks preserve the value of the currency?  Do they work together or separately?  They work together if the cost isn't high, and separately when the cost is high?  It seems not that much changes over time, aside from the fact that our currency doesn't have gold backing, or any other kind of anchor for value.  Okay, I guess some things *do* change.All that said, in short, every chapter of the twelve in the book has relevance to the modern era.  The real question to the reader is whether you want to think about how these stories relate to the present day.  I think the effort is worthwhile, and the engaged reader will benefit from the effort.QuibblesNone.SummaryThis book is good for those who like economic history, and want to learn from the lessons of the past.

"This is a book that starts with a simple premise: buy stocks at a fraction of the per share intrinsic value of the company, conservatively calculated.  Neat idea, huh, and it is called value investing.The author starts by giving a preview of where he will end -- with Carl Icahn when he was much younger, where he was buying closed-end funds at large discounts, and pressuring managers to liquidate the fund.  Eventually he started doing the same with overcapitalized companies trading a discount to the net worth of the company.Then the author takes us on a trip through history, starting with Ben Graham buying the shares of companies at prices lower than the net liquid assets of the company, net of the debt.  It was easy money while it lasted, but eventually many of those companies were bought up and liquidated, and many of the rest had the stock price bid up until the value was no longer compelling.Then we get to travel along with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, who note that the easy pickings are gone, and begin investing in companies that are inexpensive relative to their growth prospects.  This is more complicated, because these companies must have an advantage that will sustain their effort versus their competition.Then we visit Joel Greenblatt, where he analyzes buying good companies at cheap prices, analyzing them the way an acquirer might do, but also looking for high returns on invested capital.  Lo, but it works, and furthers the efforts of those trying to obtain excess returns.Then the book gets gritty, and looks at mean reversion of companies that have done poorly over the last four years.  Surprise! The worst tend to do quite well on average.  Also, raw application of simple valuation ratios tend to work on average in stock selection.  People undervalue the boring crud of the market, and overvalue the glamorous stocks, leaving an investment opportunity.Then it tells a story that is personal to me, that of Litton Industries.  Litton Industries was one of two stocks I owned as a boy -- gifts from relatives.  Litton Industries was a company that in the '50s and '60s used its highly valued stock to buy up companies that were not highly valued, and made Litton look like its earnings were growing rapidly, which propelled the value of Litton stock still higher.  So long as Litton could keep acquiring cheap-ish companies, the idea kept working, but eventually that ended, and the stock price crashed.  When did my relatives buy me shares of Litton?  Near the end, natch, when everyone know how wonderful it was.Quite a lesson for an eight year old to see the stock price down by 80% in a year.  The other stock, Magnavox, did that also, so it is a testimony to my mother's own clever investing that I ended up in this business... my story aside, the point of the Litton chapter was to point out that not all earnings growth is real, and that it is far better to focus on boring companies than what seems glamorous and successful.  Untempered optimism tends not to be rewarded.The book then moves onto investors large enough to effect change outright, buying enough of a company to force change in a management team that is lazy, incompetent, or overly conservative.  The book goes through the experiences of Ronald Brierly, T. Boone Pickens, and Carl Icahn.  The art of spotting an undervalued company, and gaining enough influence to buy the company and fix it, or see the company sold to another company that will fix it, can lead to great gains.Here the trail ends.  It started with Ben Graham buying companies that would be good investments regardless, moves to companies that will be good investments if you analyze them more closely, and ends with companies that good be good investments if you could influence a change in corporate behavior.  The same principles are being applied, but with much more analysis and potentially threat of a takeover.In closing, the book talks about what can be a way of measuring moats, which is gross profits as percentage of assets.  It also reviews what factors activist investors look for when they invest, which may give the clever a guide into what stocks to pursue.QuibblesI liked the book, and I recommend it, but in one sense the book is a  statement of how tough the value investing game has become.  Ben Graham could sit back and do simple analyses, pursuing artistic endeavors and the good life in his spare time.  We have to analyze far more closely, and be aware of whether what companies larger activist players may consider.  Value investing still has punch for amateurs, but there is a lot more work and analysis to do.SummaryThis book would be good for investors looking to understand value investing better, and how it has changed over the years.  It would not likely be good for novices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18153ZWQ0RYXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118747968#wasThisHelpful","R18153ZWQ0RYXG","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love economic history books, and I believe that most investors should read economic history.  History offers a broader paradigm for analyzing investment situations than mathematical models do.Mark Twain is overquoted on this, but only because he deserves to be quoted:‚ÄúHistory doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.‚ÄùYou can get a lot of insights into the present by reading this book.  So many disasters occurred because people presumed that the future would be much like the past, and they ended up being the ones that took the large losses.Further, this book will point out that how an asset is held will make a difference in its future performance.  When there is not a lot of debt behind an asset, there may be good prospects.  But when there is a lot of debt behind an asset, prospects are not so good because those that own the asset are relying on the asset to perform.  Those who own an asset free and clear may get hurt if the price falls, but they won't be ruined like the guy who has borrowed to own it.This book takes on every major systemic crisis from the Tulip Bubble to the recent Housing/Banking crisis.  This is my bread & butter, but I learned things in many of the chapters regarding things I thought I knew well.  Truly, a great book.What Could Have Made the Book BetterFinancial crises don't appear out of nowhere.  Leaving aside war on your home soil, plague, famine, communism, etc., there is usually a boom that gives way to a bust.  In some of his chapters, he could have spent more time describing the boom that led to the bust.  This is important, because readers need to learn intuitively that the boom-bust cycle is normal. NORMAL!Ignore the economists who think they can control the economy.  They can't do it, and this book helps to say that.  Economists are always behind the curve.  Politicians are even further behind the curve.  Regulators are still further behind the curve, and usually do the wrong thing during crises as a result.The author could have done more to suggest how individuals and policymakers should respond to financial crises.  Better to have a book that advises us, than one that just reports.QuibblesOn pages 421-422, he shows that he doesn't get securitization, and blames the rating agencies, who were forced to rate novel debt for which they did not have a good model because the regulators outsourced credit risk measurement to them.SummaryMost people would benefit from this book.

"Everyone would like a ""money machine.""  Follow simple rules, and ""Wow, this makes money.""  This is that kind of book but it has better foundations than most in its class.The book examines three types of investing, most of which are foreign to average investors.  Most investors don't invest in equity by shorting it, and most investors are not currency traders.But that is what the book encourages.  I'm going to digress here, because I have to explain some salient matters, and say what I think, so that my later critique makes sense.Volatility and credit are cousins.  After all when markets go nuts, and everything is in disarray, those that have been trying to borrow at low interest in one currency, and invest at higher interest in another currency get hosed.  Why?  Because in volatile times, the riskier currencies face capital flight versus safer currencies that have the confidence of the markets.All of the methods mentioned in this book as a result are making bets on volatility/credit, and try to control the bet by monitoring implied volatility, credit spreads, and momentum.  They limit when they are in the market and when they are out.I don't have a problem with the theory here, but with the ability of average people to carry it out.  This book would be good for quantitative hedge fund managers; I am less certain about individuals here.As an aside, what the book describes is how PIMCO has done so well at bond investing over its history -- shorting volatility to pick up yield.But the main criticism is this: the author optimized the book to fit her full data set.  When you read the last chapter, and see that you could have earned 30%+/year for 13 years, if you were as clever as the author, you should think, ""Yes, if I had 20/20 foresight.""  The methods will not do as well in prospect as in retrospect.QuibblesThere is little that I disagree with in the book on a theoretical basis.  Where I differ comes in two areas: individual investors will not have the fortitude to carry out what is a complex method of investment.  Secondly, when enough hedge fund money adopts these strategies, the pricing in the market will shift, and the hedge funds will no longer have easy money.Who would benefit from this book: If you are willing to do the work of a volatility-selling hedge fund manager, this is the book for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHRTN9F1KU4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133354342#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHRTN9F1KU4R","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes you through the corruption in the Kentucky Retirement System.  It has the dubious distinction of being the worst-funded municipal pension system in the US, leaving aside Puerto Rico.This book is very well-researched for three reasons:1) The author served one four-year term on the board of the Kentucky Retirement System, so he has insider knowledge.2) The author is an expert on pensions -- he has worked in this area for over 25 years.  He also holds a CFA Charter, which demonstrates his knowledge in investments, and his commitment to ethics in investing.3) The author extensively cites his findings, giving nearly 600 endnotes in an otherwise 256-page book.The Kentucky Retirement System is not a victim of incompetence alone, but of fraud, political favoritism, and structured neglect.  The structured neglect is probably the most serious matter.For years, Kentucky would not pay its full actuarially required contribution to the retirement system.  Now, you can't argue with the math, though you can argue with assumptions.  Not making the full payment persistently will leave a pension plan weakly funded.  As the author points out, it is a quiet means of borrowing against the future, and at a far higher rate than Kentucky could borrow in the municipal bond market.This is the product of a broken political culture that only cared about the present:1) Keeping current taxes low2) Spending more than taxes3) Politicians accepting bribes campaign contributions from those gaining pension business from the State of Kentucky.4) Board members that would not enforce thorough audits.5) Board members that would not seek out investment experts for their board.6) Politicians that would appoint weak board members that were political cronies.7) Awarding investment mandates to political cronies, where placement agents would earn disproportionate sums.8 ) And more...If you read this, you will wonder how a municipal pension plan could get screwed up so badly.  My answer is this -- the political culture of the state tolerates corruption, so it grows like a weed in obscure places like the Kentucky Retirement System.On the Rating Agencies, Etc.The book asks the question as to why the rating agencies were complicit on municipal pensions, waking up late to the problems.  My answer is simple.  The rating agencies have never hired many actuaries, and as such did not consider what is obvious to any actuary that I know.  They came to the game late, and that is normal for the rating agencies -- if there has not been a failure from a given factor, their models will not have that factor.  That's normal for most of us, because few of us can envision failures that have never happened before.Few are like Buffett, who said, ""We're paid to think about things that can't happen.""  That is the sound of one hand clapping, and few can hear it.Never allege conspiracy, when mere incompetence will do.  Few saw the housing bubble, and many denied it, including the present and incoming Fed Chairmen.  Incompetence is pervasive; we should be surprised when things go well.On Pension Obligation Bonds, we should note that they are a dumb idea, and that every municipality that has tried it ended up regretting it.  It is hard enough to fund pensions without borrowing money; it is much harder to do after borrowing money.QuibblesThe main problem with the book is that it needed a better editor.  It reads like a series of essays that are self-contained, because much material is repeated that could have been eliminated.Secondarily, the book takes a position that pension benefits can't be cut.  That is not true.  It may take constitutional changes to do so, but in a democracy, anything can be done.  We could repeal the prohibition against ex post facto laws on a basis limited to pensions.I say this because many municipal unions pressed for pensions far beyond what was warranted, in exchange for lower salary increases.  It appealed to venal politicians, because increasing pensions usually had no current cash cost.Eventually, municipalities will be forced to cut pensions, even for those that have retired.  There will be no other choice.Who would benefit from this book: If you want to know the depths of depravity in municipal pensions, this is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4FYWKYS36LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493630318#wasThisHelpful","R3R4FYWKYS36LW","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have I said this before: this is a tough book to review.  Much as I am in sympathy with Austrian Economics, I am not in sympathy with Daoism.When I came to Christ at age 16, the major rival for my heart was Daoism, not the Catholicism that I grew up with.  My main difficulty was that Catholicism did not speak with a single voice on critical matters -- one priest would say this, another that.Daoism has an advantage in some ways because it seems to describe the world; the world is cyclical, and often a condition gives way to its opposite.But Daoism, though descriptive of what happens, is amoral, as is much of radical libertarian thought.  A system without rules is no system.  There have to be rules for a good nation to exist.  On economics, there have to be ways to prosecute fraud.  There have to be ways to protect property rights.  That can't happen without a strong, if limited, government.Capitalism does not derive from Daoism, but from the laws of Moses, and the words of Jesus.  ""Thou shalt not steal."" has impact, because it implies property rights.  70% of the parables of Jesus involved money, and assumed that people were free to do with their resources as they saw fit.Daoism did not develop capitalism.  It was a creation of the Christian West.  Was everything perfect in the way it was worked out?  No.  There were many mistakes, and much dispropriation of cultures that had no concept of private property.Other ProblemsThe book would have been better without the constant repetition of foreign words.  It is pretentious to make readers learn a bevy of foreign words.Minsky is better than the author makes him out to be.  At least Minsky sees how financing gets warped through the boom-bust cycle.I believe that most financial crises occur because of government interference, but not all of them.  Men are greedy/envious/fearful enough to create self reinforcing cycles in the absence of government interference.  Look at the Creation more generally.  There are many species that ceased to exist long before Mankind became dominant.  In the same way, there have been many crises that have occurred in the absence of government interference.  ""Man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.""Practical UpshotIn the last two chapters, he comes out in favor of the Q-ratio and the price-to-book style of value investing, plus quality.  Both good ideas, but both require patience, which is in short supply among aging baby boomers.  The question to the reader is how long you are willing to wait.  That is the big question of much investing, and how to answer the question -- the book says wait.  I agree, but it is tough to hold a lot in cash in a bull market.Who would benefit from this book: It is a good book, though I doubt that many can follow the advice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SW9WPG2IJGBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111834703X#wasThisHelpful","R3SW9WPG2IJGBO","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good book, it is not a great book like The Hedge Fund Mirage.  Why?There are a few reasons.  First, the book on hedge funds contradicted the conventional wisdom.  This book confirms the conventional wisdom that interest rates have to rise.We all have to be wary of the conventional wisdom in economics.  Economics is a social science, but I mean it not in the sense that we study society, but that economists toe the line as to what is acceptable to publish.  This is guarded by peer review, which ensures that no new idea that might be correct gets published.  (This is true of most of the ""sciences"" because many ""scientists"" are not neutral observers -- they have axes to grind.)This book assumes that the US will inflate its way out of this crisis.  In the  Great Depression, it did not work that way, though many thought it would.The book correctly calls out all of the ways that Wall Street cheats individual bondholders, particularly structured notes, and the illiquidity of muni bonds.He does not get how muni bond ladders are durable investments, being a good compromise on how to avoid interest rate risk.  Further, he never mentions how the TRACE system of FINRA reports all trades.  The system is not that opaque.This is a good book, but not a great book.  Yes, I think inflation is more likely than deflation, but I don't think inflation is a slam-dunk.  We haven't had it yet amid many predictions for it.QuibblesAlready expressed.Who would benefit from this book: It is a good book, though I doubt that the theory is certain.

"This book encourages you to invest most of your savings abroad, away from the imperfect but good protections offered by US law.  I wrote a piece on this idea a few years ago that pointed out the problems with this idea.  (Note to those reading this at Amazon.com, Google ""Aleph In Defense of Home Bias"" and you will find my article.)Now don't get me wrong -- I invest in foreign companies.  One-third of the assets that I run are invested abroad, in both developed and emerging markets.  International investment is good, but it is not a panacea.  There is no inherent advantage to investing abroad versus investing in the US.  Even if emerging markets are growing more rapidly, that doesn't mean they are better to buy. because valuations are higher, and government policies are more fickle.This book is rather facile about problems in emerging markets.  Problems with Brazil led me to sell my stocks when Dilma Rousseff was elected President.  Lula promoted markets, Dilma did not.I found this book to be long on cliches, and short on sharp ideas.  If you try to take the advice as an amateur, you will have a hard time doing it.  If you decide to hire an advisor other then the authors, you won't get what the book offers.  Thus I can tell you that the book is merely a marketing pitch for their services, and so I tell you to avoid it.QuibblesAlready expressed, though I would also add that the book didn't feel right.

"This is a good book to help the inexperienced learn about investing.  It begins by teaching the rudiments of accounting through the adventures of a man and his company who have built a better mousetrap.He starts the business on his own, but needs more capital.  In the process of growing, he taps bank loans, private investors, public investors, bonded debt, and preferred stock.  All of this is done with simple explanations in a step-by-step manner.The book then explains bonds and preferred stocks.  At first I was a little skeptical, because this is supposed to be a book about stocks, and the authors made a small initial error in that section.  That was the last error they made.  I became impressed with their ability to explain corporate bonds and preferred stocks, even some arcane structures like trust preferred securities, and other types of hybrid debt.Now, if I were trying to shorten the book, a lot of those sections would have been cut.  For those that do want to learn about bonds in the midst of a stock book, you get a free bonus.  If you don't want to spend the time on bonds, you can skip those sections with little effect on your ability to understand the rest of the book.Then the book turns to trickier aspects of accounting, explaining cash flow from operations, and free cash flow.  It's all good stuff, but here is my first problem with the book: what is the most common way of giving a distorted picture of earnings?  Revenue recognition policies.  The book does not talk about revenue recognition, and the most basic idea of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP], which is revenue gets taken into earnings proportionate to the delivery of goods and services.  With financial companies, revenues are earned proportionate to release from risk.That brings up another point.  The book is very good for describing the analysis of an industrial company, but does little to describe how to deal with financial companies.  Financial companies are different, because most of the cash flow statement has no meaning.Then the book moves on to valuation of common stocks, and that is where I have my biggest problem with the book.  Though they mention other means of valuing stocks, their main valuation method is earnings.  The book does not mention price-to-book as a metric, which is a considerable fault.  Price-to-book is the main way to value financials versus ROE, while price-to-sales is a very good way to measure industrials relative to relative to profit margins.Further, it suggests that P/E multiples should remain constant as a company grows.  I'm sorry, but P/E multiples tend to shrink as a company grows.  This is because the highest margin opportunities are exploited first, and then lesser opportunities.  For the P/E to remain constant, or even expand means that new opportunities are being exploited that have higher margins.  Investors should not count on that.These mistakes are minor, though, compared to the good that the book does for an inexperienced investor.QuibblesAlready expressed.Who would benefit from this book: This is a classic book that will aid inexperienced investors to learn the basics.  Just remember, it is only the basics, and it covers most things, but not all things. It would be an excellent book for one of your relatives or friends that think they know what they are talking about in investing, but really doesn't know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CV8Q1SMSMZ1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989298205#wasThisHelpful","R1CV8Q1SMSMZ1E","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tough book to review.  It is correct in analysis of what went wrong, but overpromises in what its main goal is -- protecting assets before the next financial crisis.Let me take a step back, and describe the structure of the book.  A major goal of neoclassical macroeconomics is to try to eliminate the business cycle, and end up with smooth growth that minimizes unemployment.As a result, central bankers, since they have a freer hand than politicians, as they are appointed, not elected, act to try to stimulate demand by lower interest rates.  They did that from 1982 to 2008, until they came to the bottom rung of their ladder, and realized they could go no further.Thus ""Code Red"" -- a situation that is an emergency.  Many central banks felt they needed to act in an emergency to create liquidity to pump up economies with significant financial bankruptcies.Would it work?  When the central bankers started, all they had was theory, and  Japan.  Japan had tried out their theory, and it did them no good.The academics argued that Japan did not do it right, and sadly, one was the Chairman of the Fed.  Would that Bernanke had done his Ph.D. dissertation on another unrelated topic.  Some historical accidents are real killers, and this was one.  (As an aside: always be wary of academic researchers that have a lot invested in an idea.  They cease to be neutral, and cause contrary data to be ignored, because you can always find a method to twist the data.)Anyway, that is the first and longer part of the book explaining how bankrupt. untested theories led us to a situation where debt levels are high with governments, and central banks are ultra-loose.  In such a situation, nations will try to weaken their currencies to gain a nominal advantage over other nations, so that they can export more.  Eventually, it could lead to a currency war of competitive devaluations, or worse, a trade war of competing tariffs.If central banks cooperate with their governments, they can repress people financially, making the rate that they can invest in with safety to be lower than the inflation rate.  The authors believe that governments will try to do that and eventually fail, because credit creation will eventually lead to significant inflation.One virtue of the book is that it shows that economists with influence over policy don't know what they are doing, but make a bold show of it.  Particularly telling is Bernanke on page 135 saying the Fed can mop up excess liquidity at the right time, and he is 100% confident of that.  The Fed has never succeeded at that before, so who is he kidding?The second half of the book deals with how to protect your assets -- half is generous here, because it is 25% of the book.  It goes over the permanent portfolio idea of Harry Browne, and then a series of non-solutions in Chapter 10, essentially arguing that diversification is called for.Chapter 11 argues for inflation protection through buying shares of companies that have moats, such as:*  Valuable Intellectual Property*  Benefit from strong network effects*  Are low cost producers*  Have lock-in, and customers can't switch easily*  Natural monopolies and monopolies of market nichesThese are good ideas, in my opinion, but difficult to continually implement.  The book gives companies that presently fit the ideas of the authors, but updating it, and knowing how to trade it is tough.  We've been through eras like the early '70s, where companies like this have cratered, so this strategy does not come without the possibility where it becomes too popular, and gets abandoned.Chapter 12 goes through commodities and gold, and is bearish on them, arguing that the commodities supercycle is dead, and that gold is tied to real interest rates.In short, the second half of the book is thin.  If you are looking for protection, maybe the book should have said, there aren't a lot of great ways to seek protection against the monstrous economic policies of the developed world and China, but that wouldn't have sold many books.QuibblesI disagree with the first chapter that we had to have bailouts.  The government could have protected regulated subsidiaries of the banks, and derivative counterparties, and let the holding companies fail.  I also disagree that we had to have abnormal monetary policy to stem the crisis -- so long as there is a positive yield curve, there is stimulus, but once you get down near zero, perverse effects kick in.The rest of my disagreements are already expressed.  To summarize: the first half of the book is good, but the second half is thin gruel if you want to protect your assets.Who would benefit from this book: If you want to understand the causes of the crisis this is a great book to buy.  For protection of your assets, it will give you a few ideas, but no solution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128OFA4CFKNFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118783727#wasThisHelpful","R128OFA4CFKNFJ","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara Eisen is smart.  How smart is Sara Eisen?  She can write twelve pages on currencies, invite some clever and opinionated people to write articles for her, and serve as editor of the book, and thus get top billing for a moderate amount of work.There are other reasons why I think she is smart -- she is an able interviewer, and maybe there is not a lot of difference between choosing people to write articles for you, and knowing what to ask someone that you choose to interview.  Both require understanding the views of the person in question.Be that as it may, the ten writing the represent different points of view.  Let me briefly describe each one:1) Gary Shilling -- The US Dollar has its weaknesses, but is stronger than all of the alternatives, because the US possesses a lot of strengths not found in the rest of the world.2) Stephen L. Jen -- The Chinese Yuan will become a reserve currency, but it is highly unlikely that it will significantly replace the US Dollar in the intermediate term.3) Jorg Asmussen -- The Euro can be an alternative to the US Dollar if it overcomes integration issues, and continues to deepen economic integration.4) John Taylor -- Assuming the Euro survives its imbalances, a shrinking population and sclerotic economic policies will make the Eurozone less important by 2050.5) Megan Greene -- The Eurozone will be better off if weaker nations leave.6) Anoop Singh & Papa N'Diaye -- Even though rebalancing to internal growth through increased domestic consumption will slow down Chinese growth, in the long run it will lead to a better, healthier Chinese economy and currency.7) James Rickards -- Competitive devaluation is leading to currency wars, but embracing deflation and austerity as the Euro has is the right path.  We can do the same thing globally through the IMF with their SDRs.8 ) Peter Boockvar -- We need to tie the hands of the Central Bankers, because they overshoot and make economic volatility worse.  One way to do so is through a gold or other commodity standard.9) Robert Johnson -- Much like the authors in Chapter six, except more pessimistic about whether it will happen.Do You Want a Conclusion or Not?This  book offers no unified point of view or conclusion, and that is a strength, because it mirrors the debate that exists in the world today.  If you are not confused, you don't get it.  That said, the book could have been much stronger if the ten authors were allowed to respond to the other authors briefly, with a brief rebuttal from the original author.  The weakness of the book is that there is no interaction, no attempt to see how the views fight or agree with each other.

"I'm a value investor, and one that is not doctrinaire about a narrow set of principles.  Yes, I like my eight rules, but they are broad principles that admit a lot of flexibility.The Manual of Ideas introduces readers to a wide number of ways to source investing ideas that may offer value.  There are nine main areas that they highlight:1) One can invest in a small number of stocks that are worth more dead than alive.  Net-net stocks show places where the downside is minimal, and profits could be made if either the company turns around or liquidates.2) Sometimes companies obscure their value because they do multiple things.  The company would be more valuable broken into its constituent parts, which would get a higher  valuation in aggregate.3) You can follow the magic formula, and buy stocks that have high returns on equity and low P/E ratios.4) You can own stocks managed by talented managers, and I admit that maybe 7 of the 37 stocks I hold fall into that bucket, and I will not readily sell them.  The question is how you find those managers.  That's not easy, and involves industry knowledge which is not available to all.5) You can own stocks owned by smart investors, and I admit that I track this every quarter.  I get a lot of good ideas from them, but I like to look at the ideas that are cold, because they offer more potential.6) Buy teensy stocks that no one follows, that are making money and have legitimate business models.  You can't put a lot of money to work that way, but if you get it right, it can add value.7) Buy companies that are undergoing a structural change that adds value.  Example: a petroleum refiner decides to spin off a pipeline Master Limited Partnership.8 ) Buy highly indebted companies that offer the potential of huge gains if the idea works out.  Screen out companies that are more likely to lose it all.9) Buy international companies -- the scrutiny and competition are less -- you may find something genuinely cheap, but make sure they play fair with outside passive minority shareholders.There are some very good methods here, but what should you decide to pursue?  That is the one weakness of the book.  The book gives you a significant but not exhaustive tour of the ideas behind value investing.  What would have added a lot is an integrated chapter on when it is best to pursue each set of ideas. It is difficult enough for professional investors to know which method is best at a given time, much less amateurs.  The time of investors, both professional and amateur, is limited.  It would be a great aid to figure out how to prioritize the methods or ideas.Also, more emphasis on margin of safety would have been useful.

"Just follow my methods and you will make money. Yes, it is another one of *those* books.  Most of them are not worth your money.  This one might be worth it, but let me give you my misgivings.The book warms up slowly, because it spends most of its early time destroying other ideas, without introducing their main ideas.  For example, it spends time destroying:*  Gains in the market come slowly and steadily.  Correct, that's wrong.  As my readers should know, market returns are lumpy. [Note to readers at Amazon, there are links at my blog that explain these concepts in greater detail.]*  Modern Portfolio Theory.  Again, no argument here, it is not a good explanation as to how the market works.*  Volatility isn't risk; risk is the potential to lose.  Again right.*  Diversification among risky assets does not provide much risk reduction.  Again right.*  Most mutual funds miss out on the ability to limit risk, because they forbid market timing.  Here I differ.  Aside from funds that aim to time the markets, the asset allocation decision is not in the hands of the managers, but the shareholders, who must them selves decide how much stocks to hold.This leads to their main hypothesis, that people have been duped into buy & hold investing, when they could make a lot more money if they only invested when conditions are favorable.There are two problems with this: 1) how can you tell when times are favorable or not?  I use the credit cycle, and estimates of what various asset classes are likely to return if they were private businesses, but not everyone can follow that.  They give their simplified version, which is a moving average crossover method.  Buy when stocks are above the moving average.  Sell when they are below.  Simple, huh?Yes, simple, and that brings up problem 2.  If a lot of people began managing money in a way like this, the market would become more volatile.  At moving average crossovers, people would rush to buy and sell as groups.  Some would shorten their moving average formula to get a jump on others.  Any risk control method, if used by many will cease to work well.Other Difficulties*  Though it is not a major aspect of their book, and it comes toward the end, part of the goal of the book is to interest people in purchasing their newsletter and/or money management services.*  At times, buy and hold investing is the optimal way to go for an era.  Also, not holding assets for a long time limits the ability to limit taxes, and compound really large gains.  My mother and my father-in-law, amateur investors both, limited their taxes on their investing largely through buying and holding quality stocks over decades.  (The authors do advise that their strategy is best done in a tax-deferred account.)*  At one point the book insists that the Capital Asset Pricing Model [CAPM] implies that the equity risk premium is constant.  Sorry, but that's not true.  Many financial planners act as if it is true.  What is true is that it is challenging to estimate the varying equity risk premium.  Value investors have their own way of doing it, but it boils down to: ""I'm not seeing many attractive opportunities to deploy capital.""*  On page 116, they make too much out of how households have too much money in cash as a fraction of their assets near market bottoms.  The amount of cash may vary some -- in general at market bottoms, institutions hold relatively more stock, but the main reason for the increased percentage invested in cash is simply the fall in prices for risky assets.  Aside from IPOs, mergers for cash, acquisitions for cash, money doesn't enter & exit the market.  Market prices reflect the willing of marginal buyers and sellers to trade cash for stock, and vice-versa.  In aggregate, nothing changes except the price.*  They criticize the Facebook IPO as one where sellers knew things would get worse, and so they sold, delivering losses to buyers.  But Facebook stock is considerably higher now than the IPO price.  Those that took the losses from the IPO didn't wait long enough.*  Page 150 -- it took a longer time after 1980 before 401(k)s began replacing Defined Benefit pensions plans in any major way.  Congress passed several pieces of legislation in the late 80s which made sponsoring a DB plan less attractive; that's when the changes started in earnest.*  Page 171 -- there were many in the insurance industry that remembered being burned on Collateralized Debt Obligations [CDOs] 1998-2002.  It was a common insight that CDOs were weak assets, and underpriced among insurers.  A new class of buyers got skinned in 2008, particularly banks and hedge funds.*  Page 180 -- there were many firms that anticipated the fall in subprime lending.  I worked for one of them.  I wrote an article about it for RealMoney.com in late 2006.  It took a lot of courage to take action on the ""Big Short,"" and not many did.*  The book dabbles on many topics, showing a superficial understanding of many ideas/events in order to show they one should not buy & hold.  The book plods for 80%+ of its pages developing what fails, and spends less than 20% of its time giving what one ought to do.  Their strategy takes up ~40 pages of a ~240 page book.All that said, is the strategy a reasonable one?  Probably yes, but not if a lot of people adopt it.  Advanced amateur investors could implement the ideas of the book easily, those with less experience would need help to do it, and the authors offer that help, much of it free, and more for a fee.QuibblesAlready expressed.

"I debated whether to review this book or not.  But I have read the whole book, and I can tell you that it is a great book.  The internet has changed the terms of work for many, and for many programmers they can work where they like.The author has written many books, and he was invited by WordPress to be a leader of a team inside WordPress.  This tale describes how a guy who used to work for Microsoft could succeed in an unstructured environment like WordPress.During his tenure, his team created great products for users, like Jetpack, and a consistent comment system.The title of the book stems from the idea  that bloggers write in their pajamas -- they don't wear pants.  But WordPress powers over 20% of the websites of the internet.  It is a quiet and significant power over the internet.The book deals with the culture of WordPress, the challenges of offering software versus offering a website, and more.  The creation of Jetpack, and a new comments system occupy a large portion of the book.Only non-local businesses can benefit from this book.  Most businesses require people to be together regularly.  The book overstates that it is the future of work.  Being local is a big thing, particularly when services are personal, or when transport costs are high.QuibblesThere are a few grammar errors in the book; it could have used a better editor.  Was there an editor?Who would benefit from this book: Anyone trying to understand how to manage a dispersed workforce would benefit from this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YX9VNO5X75TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVJXI4M#wasThisHelpful","R1YX9VNO5X75TU","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a normal book for me to review.  The claims made by the book are fantastic, and the subject of the book, Sam Israel, would have a strong motive for self-exoneration.  But with any book, unless you have direct insight into what the book talks about, you have to interpret the book consistently, assuming the author has told the truth.  That is what I will do.I have a saying, ""It is very difficult to cheat an honest man."" Why is that so?  An honest man knows that few things come easy in life, and so if something seems too good to be true, he will avoid someone peddling something that is likely to be a scam.But someone who thinks the world is inherently crooked is much easier to cheat, because he thinks that he will be able to outfox others trying to cheat him.  He is more vulnerable to playing an inside game that few others know about.Sam Israel drifted into a Ponzi scheme.  He may not have intended to do so, but once you report fake results that are too good, it is difficult to ever come back to true accounting, because the assets have to earn considerably more than average in order to break even.  New money helps a lot, and that is driven by great returns, so there is the incentive to keep reporting ""too good"" returns.It's a treadmill, which is why Ponzi schemes always blow up.  In Sam Israel's case, it led to all manner of speculative investments that an ordinary investor would never touch.  In the second half of the book, it led to dealing with a smooth-talking guy who charmed and scammed Sam Israel, convincing him that there was a conspiracy that controlled Western governments with a rigged bond market that offered incredible deals to insiders.Now, to me, anything that seems too complicated to justify the worldview is probably not true.  What reason would a conspiracy have to hand out risk-free profits to anyone?  Governments or conspirators would pocket the money themselves, and would not let anyone else in.  But to a crooked mind that needs an easy win in order to set all things right, this is a perfect setup to separate a fool and his money (or rather, the money of his clients).As it was, Sam Israel ran out of money and his ""hedge fund"" collapsed, leaving many foolish investors to mourn their losses.One more thing: a undercurrent of the book was how they managed to co-opt the auditors.  Beware trusting small no-name auditors.QuibblesThe book is well-written, and if you take it as fiction, it is a real page-turner.  But as truth, you are reliant on a few voices, mostly Sam Israel and his friends, to tell you what happened.  I'm reluctant to sign onto that, but I can't fully rule it out either.Who would benefit from this book: If you like fiction, you will like this.  If you want to look into the pathology of a Ponzi Scheme, it is good there also.  If you like reading sordid tales of greed, foolishness, and lies, you will like it.  Otherwise, avoid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M2P444OORJ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307716074#wasThisHelpful","R1M2P444OORJ3H","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciated this book.  In my early 20s, I wanted to do development work in developing countries, but I ran into a problem.  All of the interventionist solutions didn't work, and countries that ignored the advice of development economists tended to do better.  That has continued to be true since then.  Among academic economists, the battle goes on between the socialists and free marketers.  The battle goes on in many arenas:*  It is easy to do cross-sectional time-series regressions across countries, and twist the data to your bias.  In general, more flexible the econometric technique, the lower the probability that it tells an accurate story.  Noise gets interpreted as signal. [The Ph. D.s at the Fed are experts at this.]*  How much of poverty is due to culture, recalcitrant governments denying property rights to their people, etc?*  How much different was it for the now developed nations to develop during their era?  Do the same principles apply?*  Are there really ""poverty traps"" in development?*  Are there structural problems in development that naturally occur, or does it stem from government interference?This book takes an optimistic view on development, against the crowd that creates complex models in order to allege market imperfections, rather than government imperfections.  The truth is that poverty in the world is in retreat, and abject poverty may not exist in another generation, aside from nations that sabotage themselves.  Nations that are growing can follow the same path of freedom as the developed nations did.This book will open your eyes on global poverty, and make you realize that we are close to success, aside from self-inflicted wounds.  It will also make you think through the metaphysics and ethics of global warming, and explain to you why it is unfair for the developed nations to constrain the developing nations regarding use of hydrocarbons.  [For those that are partisans on global warming, this book argues that global cooling is happening.  Is your mind open enough to consider the argument?]I recommend this book highly.

"I am biased on AIG.  It was never as good as proponents of its past have said.  But it was not as bad as current detractors allege.AIG went through several eras, some of which are barely covered by this book.  There was the secular growth era, which existed from the beginning until the late 1980s.  It was easy to continue to grow in P&C businesses in the US until then.  After that growth would have to come from other ideas:  Life insurance in the US and abroad.  Foreign P&C insurance  Aircraft leasing  Asset managementAnd so, AIG moved from being primarily a US P&C insurance company to being a behemoth, big in life and P&C everywhere, as well as aircraft leasing and asset management.Other Books on AIGIf you are reading this book, you ought to also read Fallen Giant: The Amazing Story of Hank Greenberg and the History of AIG. and Fatal Risk: A Cautionary Tale of AIG's Corporate Suicide.  Excellent books both, but they cover different aspects of AIG.  Fallen Giant focuses more on the development of AIG by the founder Cornelius Vander Starr.  It spends relatively little time on the fast growth era which was the start of Greenberg tenure as CEO.Fatal Risk focuses on the diversification era under Greenberg's era, when AIG was so big in US P&C insurance that they began diversifying into risks that had more capital markets exposure -- Life, annuities, derivatives, airline leasing, commodities, and asset management.All three of the books spend disproportionate time on the failure of AIG, which is kind of a shame, because the failure was the simplest part of the story.  No risk controls because Greenberg was ousted.  That said, risk control should be institutionalized, not personalized.  That was Greenberg's fault.  No one man should be in charge of risk for a whole company.  Too much subprime and other mortgage risk spread through the whole organization. (Investments in the life companies, securities lending, derivatives, direct lending, mortgage insurance, etc.)  True leverage was understated on the GAAP financials.Notable InformationOne aspect of AIG that The AIG Story tells is how AIG became a single company.  There were many minority interests, and when Greenberg was a new CEO he bought all of them in.  That decision allowed the company to focus, and not be concerned with minority interests.In two breezy pages (122-123) we get Greenberg's take on how he built his life insurance business, buying SunAmerica (1998) and American General (2001).  An aggressive company buys two more aggressive companies, overpaying in the process.  There should be no surprise why AIG's stock price was basically flat from 1999 to 2007.  Greenberg overpaid for life insurance companies he did not understand.  He was a P&C guy, and did not get how life insurance companies worked.  He saw two aggressive companies willing to sell at exorbitant prices, and paid up.  Culturally, they fit, but buying overpriced assets always takes its toll.Not mentioned is the debacle that was the attempt to take over The Equitable in 1991.  AIG assumed that a New York company would have a distinct advantage versus AXA, a French company that was the eventual buyer.  AIG made the following errors:  Scared Equitable's management team into the arms of AXA, who would treat them well.  Yes, Equitable's management team was incompetent, and needed to be shown the door, but you didn't have to tell them that directly.  Assumed that the Real Estate portfolio would not rebound.  AIG offered to buy The Equitable for very little, while AXA offered $1 billion of funny money, surplus notes and convertible debt.  Strange, but the funny money was worth more than almost nothing.Unlike the purchases of SunAmerica and American General, the purchase of The Equitable would have been cheap.  Very cheap.  And AIG missed it, and also under-rated the abilities of AXA.  I was there; I know.This brings me to a significant point over what was included, and what was excluded... this is the story as Greenberg wants it to be told.  He excludes his errors, and focuses on his achievements.  He was not as good of a CEO as often credited in the 1990s.On page 127, Greenberg talks about leaving markets where AIG could not earn an underwriting profit, but by the 1990s, AIG was so big that that flexibility was gone.Closed CultureAIG's culture bound employee  fortunes to the stock price of AIG.  Options, participation in C.V. Starr, and a number of other programs created significant incentives for people to stay, and trust in the continual increase in the price of AIG shares.  That created a culture of ""lifers"" if if survived long enough.Also, in the 1980s and 1990s the board of AIG had more insiders than most, but when corporate governance rules changed, by 2005, the AIG board was populated by enough incompetent businesspeople, that there was no way that they could control the risks inside AIG.  They tossed out Greenberg at the behest of Spitzer, and then could not supply the moxie that Greenberg had.The Financial CrisisThe post-2008 Greenberg understands the financial crisis.  Let me quote:  A financial crisis was brewing due to a combination a including: (1) U.S. policy overstimulated appetites for home ownership and kept interest rates low for too long, (2) regulation of institutions was poor, as commercial banks fed the appetite for home ownership with generous mortgages while investment banks demand with complex financial products and increasing leverage; (3) rating agencies failed to analyze many financial products adequately, and the lack of trading in such products on organized markets made them difficult to value; and (4) regulators at the SEC failed to monitor the leverage of many financial institutions, whose debt levels rose to as much as 30 to 40 times capital and, in AIG's case, regulators at the  Office of Thrift Supervision, which had authority because AIG owned a savings and loan association, simply ignored any signs of trouble.Hindsight is 20/20... there were many mortgages insured by AIG before Greenberg left, and many mortgage bonds purchased by his life subsidiaries as well.Greenberg tries to make out the problems of AIG as a liquidity crisis, and not a solvency crisis.  I'm sorry, but in a panic, there is no difference.  If you can't produce cash when needed, you are insolvent.  It's that simple.  AIG had enough incremental demands for cash in the crisis, that it should have gone into chapter 11.  Maybe the Fed should have rescued the derivatives counterparty, and charged it back to AIG, but beyond that, it should not have acted.  Much as Greenberg complains, AIG was insolvent, and should have been reorganized.  He would have gotten far less as a result.He also takes umbrage against Ed Liddy, a good man who attempted to do what the stupid government wanted -- liquidate in a hurry, but Greenberg does not recognize that he set much of this process (though not all of it) in motion himself.Greenberg won the suits against himself.  He personally did nothing materially wrong.  But the mismanagement of AIG in the Greenberg era and the time thereafter did deserve to be punished with chapter 11, not coddled with a bailout and tax incentives.QuibblesThe book is worth reading, but what you are getting here is court history -- the history as approved by the King.  It has elements of history in it, and it is mostly true, but you have to consider the source.  A lot of true history was purposely omitted.Who would benefit from this book: If you are an AIG buff, you can't get the full picture without knowing what Greenberg purports.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS06MUXR5H6OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118345878#wasThisHelpful","RS06MUXR5H6OI","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my life, I have been a mortgage bond manager, and a corporate bond manager.  I have enough overall experience that I have played in most bond and loan categories, including municipal bonds.Municipal bonds are one place where the competition level is low, and additional knowledge can pay off.  This is particularly true in an era where municipal bond insurance is less prevalent, and as such credit analysis has more value.This book gives you the basics on municipal bonds.  The most basic idea is economic necessity.  Who will be harmed if the municipality in question can't perform?  If the the answer is ""few,"" that might not be a good municipal bond to buy, unless there are significant covenants requiring a municipality to raise taxes to pay for the debt service.Municipal bonds are an unusual market because there are many issuers, purposes, and bond styles.  The dominant non-taxable bonds are only bought by Americans, and sometimes only by those in a given state.Municipal bonds are also different because most of the bonds issued have long maturity dates.  Municipalities want predictability in borrowing costs; they also match the borrowing term to the length of what is funded, which is typically long.The book will take you through:*  Bond types*  Covenants*  Types of bonds that are more risky*  How bonds pay off*  Taxation of bonds*  The ugliness of trading municipal bonds*  The challenge of analyzing municipal economies*  Basic yield calculations*  Portfolio management*  Derivatives -- though that was more of an issue in the pastI would highlight one big issue here.  Most small municipal issues rarely trade.  Assembling your own portfolio of municipal bonds is a tough proposition.  Flexibility is required to assemble your own ladder of municipal bonds.QuibblesNone.

"This is a book that gets everything right in broad, but is too insistent on the details.  How should you approach value investing from a purely quantitative standpoint?  Easy:*  Screen out stocks that have relatively high accruals*  Avoid companies that may go bankrupt*  Margin of safety: choose companies with strong balance sheets and profits*  Look for long-term strength in profits.*  Buy them cheap.*  Buy when informed investors are buying.But here's the problem.  Like the book What Works on Wall Street, Fourth Edition: The Classic Guide to the Best-Performing Investment Strategies of All Time, Quantitative Value suffers from over-optimization.  You pass through the data too many times, and you show great returns from the past, should someone have done it that way.  But how much of the result is signal, and how much is an accident?The broad principles are unavoidably true.  Even the measure of quality, Gross Profits as a fraction of Assets, was new to me, but when I read it, I realized that it was a proxy for having a moat, a sustainable competitive advantage.  I added it to my screening framework.With all of that said, I have simple advice to the readers.  Follow the broad outlines of what the book teaches, but don't follow it in detail.  It is good to own companies that are sound, cheap, and improving.I would also add this: use quantitative screening and scoring as a first step.  I often note that companies that score well in my screens have accounting issues.  So, be wary, and realize that value investing primarily means having a margin of safety. I.e., you won't lose much if you are wrong.  Purely quantitative value investing can be improved through company and industry knowledge.QuibblesAlready expressed.Who would benefit from this book: Amateur value investors will benefit from this book; if the reader does not want to put the effort into learning value investing, this book will be of no use to him.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQOP46BT90ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118328078#wasThisHelpful","R1PQOP46BT90ZJ","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several months ago, I was walking in my bedroom, and in a stack of books that we frequently give as gifts, I saw the book Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond.  I said to myself, where did this come from?  I looked at it, and realized that hadn't read it.  I looked at the copyright date, and realized that 2001 is a relatively old book.So I read the first chapter, decided it was good stuff, and added it to the reading pile.  As some might know, I am a value investor, and recently I wrote an article called ""Value Investing Flavors.""  In it, I took a broad view of value investing, because there are many common principles to value investing employed by all, but many variations on implementation. [Note to those reading at Amazon; they don't me post links, but if you Google ""Aleph From Graham to Buffett and Beyond"" you will find it.]The book begins with unified principles of value investing: margin of safety, buy ing an asset cheap, etc., but moves on to different ways to implement value investing, depending on the types of companiesthe investor wants to analyze.There are three ways to do the analysis for value investing:*  Re-estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  This applies best to companies where converting resources to a better use would be compelling.*  Estimate the normalized earnings power of a slow growing company.*  For a company with a moat, a sustainable competitive advantage, conservatively estimate the path of growing earnings.I listed the three of them in the order of increasing aggressiveness of analysis, and the amount of work that would need to be done to be assured that there is an opportunity.After this, the book writes about eight notable value investors, who come from the various camps inside value investing, and puts more flesh on the bones as to the implementation of each method.  I immediately recognized the names of 6 of the 8 value investors.But what I found most useful were the insights of the investors that would buy small companies.  You can buy ugly situations that are misunderstood, and wait for management to turn the ship around.This book was a good balance between theory and practice.  I enjoyed this book.

"Personal finance has issues.  This is because there are many things that are true on average that will not always prove true in the short run.  Here are some examples:*  Those that save more and spend less for personal needs will usually do better in the long run than those that spend a higher proportion of their income.*  Those that take moderate risks in investing tend to beat both those that take low risks, and those that take high risks.  But over short periods of time, who can tell?*  Over the long run ""buy and hold"" tends to work.  In the short run, who can tell?*  Good investing is boring.  It is not entertaining.  An average person looking at the portfolio that I own for my clients would only recognize 10 of the 36 companies that I hold.  The best stocks are those of neglected companies that do their boring business and make money quietly.*  In general, it is wise to have as little debt as possible.  When you do have debt, pay it off rapidly, or make sure that the debt is non-recourse (the asset purchased collateralizes the loan in full.*  In general, it is honorable to pay your debts in full.  Occasionally, some life event happens that makes it impossible.  That is what the bankruptcy code is for.  When bad providence is overwhelming, take the hit, declare bankruptcy, and battle back from there.  In the Bible, debt-slavery was limited to seven years -- why should the loan sharks get more of your life than that?*  Financial education, as well as education in general, is no panacea.  As one of my brighter friends at RealMoney, Howard Simons,  used to say (something like), ""On Wall Street, to those that are expert, we give them super-advanced tools that they can use to destroy themselves.""  There is almost never a level playing field in investing, unless you do all of the work yourself.*  Risk control is the key to investing, and women do better at that than most men.  I liken it to chefs.  Most of the best chefs are men, but women beat men on average in cooking.  (An aside: cooking is my hobby.  My wife likes my cooking.)*  There is no way to get rich quick.  Ignore seminars that tell you that it is possible, like ""Rich Dad.""*  Peter Lynch popularized ""buy what you know,"" but he was far brighter than that and a real detail person.  Many people moved to residential real estate post-2002, but did not realize that if prices get high relative to rents, that prices can fall.  They bought what they thought they knew, and lost.*  After the market declines of 2000-2003 and 2008-2009, many people swore off the stock market at the wrong time.  The uneducated buy and sell in response to fear and greed.  Buy and hold is better than that, always, and that is one reason to employ a professional that does not get shaken by market moves, good or bad.  (It took 5-10 years to develop ice-water in my veins.)*  It is always good to be skeptical of those that talk to you about finance, even me.  Particularly be skeptical of those that will buy you a nice meal with the aim of getting your business.  There are many strategies to get you to say ""yes.""  If you dare, read marketing books, they will help you develop sales resistance.*  Defined benefit pension plans are better for workers than defined contribution plans like the 401(k), but they cost a lot, lot, lot more.  That's why they don't exist today.*  Most people, if left to themselves, will not plan for the future.  That is why there are commissioned salesmen (brokers/insurance) to sell them products inferior to what they would get if they planned for themselves.That took more words than I expected. Before I go on, I want to say that I liked that book a lot with some reservations.Let me now go to the book, and tell you what I liked and what I did not.What I Liked*  The book is honest, it flags all of the problems in personal finance.  Some of those problems are unavoidable, because returns in the market are lumpy, as opposed to the smooth projections of the financial planner.*  It explains why defined benefit plans are better for average people, because they are not investors, they are budgeters at best, and need to receive a steady income in retirement.*  She explains the ways that salesmen try to make you buy what you shouldn't.*  She understands that most investment advice is shallow, and wrong.*  Expense and debt control aren't everything.  That said, they are good things.*  She recognized that women are better risk managers than men.  (Men are too certain of themselves; I have rules for myself that tie my hands so that I do not act on fear or greed.)*  She gets that real estate is an expense, and not an investment.*  Financial celebrities are often wrong.*  She understands that the financial industry has many tendrils into academia & politics, to spread a message favorable to itself.What I Did Not Like*  It may be that most people in financial trouble have had notable accidents happen to them, but that does not invalidate the idea that being careful with your spending and sparing on debt are wise ideas.  Aside from that, people need to insure themselves properly, and be prepared for layoffs -- have transferable skills that can work in multiple industries; be a continual learner.  Also, be aware of the finances of your company.  If you think it is in trouble, look for work before you are laid off.*  She doesn't get how expensive it would be to create defined benefit plans in place of defined contribution plans.  The costs are what led corporations to terminate the plans.*  She doesn't get that there are many people who will not take prudent actions for the future.  That is what commissioned salesmen are for.  They get the imprudent to do something good for them selves that they would notordinarily do.*  Talking about money is not enough.  With most people it is a mere sharing of ignorance, and not much better than what you get from other sources.  You *can* get educated about money, but it takes time, effort, and diligence.  Who is willing to do that?SummaryShe is long on critique, and short on real ideas to improve the situation.  The critique will help you know what to avoid.  But when you are done with this book, you will have no positive plan for what you should do.  Thus, three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YV391TLV9SB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591844894#wasThisHelpful","R24YV391TLV9SB","A2D2Y928DNB2L9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D2Y928DNB2L9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't had it long enough to see if it dies right away but I won't be surprised if it does soon as it's a pretty crummy disc player.  It uses batteries like crazy because it takes a ton of power to run. My battery charger shows the batteries to be near still near a full charge when this player quits and you have to put in a brand new pair. And if you touch it, even lightly,  it skips. It's pure crap. Everything about it feels cheap. Had it been $15-20 I still wouldn't want it.  I'll likely send it back.  Why Amazon sells this crap as Prime is beyond me.

"Absolutely the best book on Suicide. It's there to help people in spite of a uncaring medical  and social system that is all in the dark ages IMO. He believes people have that right of choice in their own lives and he doesn't want to see people make life even more hellish with a nasty failure. Killing yourself is not as straight forward as one might think and so you really need to be educated on this subject if you are suicidal.  This is your book and at any price it's worth it.  I have several others (and more expensive) that claim to be definitive but this is the only one that I know of that comes close to being that.  The writing style is clear and in layman's terms and thank goodness he even has a sense of humor.  He also focus on Suicide as a social phenomenon with lots of stats and how suicides can be prevented.

I own 6 salt lamps so I kind of know what a failed lamp looks like. The pyramid shape is really cool though. Wish they had done some quality control before charging $30 for these.

"I was not sure at first whether I wanted to put this adapter kit into service. With my recent purchase of a TiVo TCD750500 Premiere 4 Digital Video Recorder (Black) and TiVo TCDA92000 TiVo Mini to replace older TiVos, I received an additional unit of this product bundled with the setup. Both TiVos include MoCA built in, and use the Actiontec adapter as a bridge from your cable router.So, I added the adapters in this kit to have a full setup for my purposes. I am not using the built-in MoCA adapter in the Premiere; instead I have bridged the Actiontec adapter in my media center to an Ethernet switch, which distributes network signals to: a Bluetooth disc player, a RoKu box, a Squeezebox receiver, and TiVo. All of these were formerly on my WiFi network. Needless to say, they are all now receiving strong, fast streams that are very seldom interrupted for buffering or timeouts.The third Actiontec adapter (there are only two in the reviewed kit, but remember I received a third one from TiVo) is in our office, where it is bridging to a second Ethernet cluster handling our iMac and a Netgear ReadyNAS storage server, along with assorted printers and other devices. This has made the ReadyNAS practical for serving music to the Squeezeboxes in the house, as well as doing Time Machine backups over the network.This adapter conforms to the MoCA standards for installation: no configuration, simple plug and play. As my cable tech support informed me, it does not interfered with other signals on the coax in any way. My cable provider supplies the same adapter for their ""whole house"" DVR service, which I accidentally have replicated with TiVo!The adapter I received from TiVo failed after about 45 days, but was promptly replaced by them, and I have had no further issues with the in-service boxes.Lesson: You CAN run all your devices on WiFi if so equipped. That does not mean you SHOULD. This adapter kit can help get your stationary devices (printers, NAS, desktop computers, media, and so on) on a fast, ""wired"" network at low cost, and take the load off the WiFi network. This means your portable devices (laptops, tablets, phones, and low-bandwidth WiFi devices) will be able to get a much better and faster stream.These adapters can help you get there without drilling holes or doing funky things; just use the coax you already have available in your home. (Cable TV service not necessary, despite the ""Cable TV Service"" phrase in the product name.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQTPL3PAG307/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EQ4BQG#wasThisHelpful","RSQTPL3PAG307","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this mic with a TASCAM DR-40 4-Track Portable Digital Recorder for an oral history project. The sound quality of this large diaphragm condenser microphone is startlingly good. I have it mounted on a desktop small boom in its shock mount, with a pop filter in front, and all in a cube lined with acoustical foam.The shock mount is a must. I can hear in my phones the slightest rustle or rumble. This microphone is highly sensitive to ambient noise, and the one drawback I've found is that I've had to stop recordings and instruct my subjects to stop touching the table (or in one case rubbing their coat-sleeve!).Voices sound very present on the recording, and I am very impressed. The construction is solid aluminum, and the case is well-machined (as you can tell by unscrewing the end).The phantom power requirement of this mic does drain my DR-40 batteries more quickly, and it would benefit from its own on-board battery. It is disappointing that the shock mount does not have a snubber so it can be tightened at a specific angle, but I consider it a bonus that it was included as part of the kit.This mic will be in my kit for a long time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NKCXVBNOYCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006UGE9K#wasThisHelpful","R12NKCXVBNOYCC","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The vinyl cover supplied with my 2013 highwall popup has already started to fail. It looks nice, but the elastic bottom hem has stretched with moisture and stress after just two long road trips. It was riding up the tanks during our last haul, and I'm sure it would be a matter of time before it just flew off entirely.This product is well-molded and engineered, and it went together very easily. Although other reviewers have noted that the threaded fitting needed a lot of force to install, they should understand that this is a push fitting and requires that force in order to work. I found it took just a little more than ordinary effort to push up on the plastic base with one hand while pulling up on the threaded rod with the other. (If this fitting were in a larger hole to make it easier to install, it would fall out. If it were to depend on the nut above to hold it, it would also fall out.)The cover feels sturdy, and looks much better than the black vinyl cover supplied by the manufacturer. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I installed it with the cover opening facing toward the trailer instead of the tow vehicle. I expect this will avoid any problems with wind flipping the cover up and possibly blowing it off its hinges.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQKPDIG35AIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024ECC3S#wasThisHelpful","R2RQKPDIG35AIC","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nate Silver dissects the world of prediction and forecasting with his own bias at the fore. Since that bias happens to Bayesian theory (whose first step in the method is to set out one's preconceptions and biases on a topic set out for prediction), this is appropriate.The Big Surprise for me was that I found myself appreciating the analytical grounding of Donald Rumsfeld‚Äîwho was the very public face of an administration and a war I abhorred. Silver breaks out the phrase that was so maligned by Rumsfeld's critics as an example of his opaque, last-century thinking and reveals its brilliance in context. The ""unknown unknown"" is part of a matrix: what we know we know, what we know we don't know, what we don't know we know, and what we don't know that we don't know. Silver demonstrates how the last case, ""don't know/don't know,"" was an underlying factor for the intelligence failures leading up to the 9/11 attacks. Since no one in the intelligence community or elsewhere could imagine that human beings would intentionally hijack an airliner with the intention of using it in a suicide attack (they ""didn't know that they didn't know this""), attackers could therefore exploit openings in a security system that was looking for hijackers who wanted to survive.The incessant and well-deserved jabs at media political analysts are amusing and revelatory. The traditional nSometimes Silver goes on a bit too long analyzing each of his example cases, but each discussion builds on the last and the reader is left with an appreciation for how difficult forecasting and prediction truly are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2378JNSXSBVJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V65R54#wasThisHelpful","R2378JNSXSBVJ8","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wind-up timers are a thing of the past. They are imprecise, and they will break down (or be broken by an inexperienced user).This Leviton switch is perfect for long-duration timing tasks. Although my whole-house fan operates way below the rating of the switch, this also allows for expansion if I choose eventually to install a second unit. The panel design protects the small rubber ""nubbins"" that actually switch the internal electronics. The switch is isolated from its load via relay, which like most consumer electronics relays will make a loud click as it switches on or off.Leviton includes beige and ivory panels in addition to the white panel installed on the switch. The panel can be changed without tools by squeezing attachment ears behind the aluminum heat sink. I found this to be very easy.You MUST have a full electrical circuit to this device for it to operate. In a new installation, that means you bring the circuit first to the switch, then to the load you are planning to control. This is different than a single-pole light switch, which only requires the one part of the circuit you want to interrupt in order to control the load.Translation: you must have a black wire and a white wire (""hot"" and ""neutral""), along with a green or bare copper wire (""ground), at the switch in order for it to operate. This is because the switch itself requires power in order to work.The switch is programmable for different operating durations. All this really means is that Leviton manufactures one switch, programs a batch of them on the line, and packages that batch along with the appropriately-marked panels. They do supply instructions in the package to change timing modes, but unless you bought the wrong switch AND you could live with the wrong markings on the panel, there is no practical use for this feature.I have had a similar-looking Leviton 30-minute timer controlling my bathroom fan for the past nine years, and it has survived that relatively harsh environment. I expect this switch to do just as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGMJJOWSXA9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00313JXBA#wasThisHelpful","R2YGMJJOWSXA9K","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beauty of ""How It's Made"" is in its simplicity. The director and camera crews appreciate the beauty of industrial processes. Some of their best work comes when they capture what's happening in a high-speed assembly line. Many of their scenes feature automatics that function with the precision and grace of ballet.Discovery has tried introducing similar programs in the years since the Canadian-produced ""How It's Made"" started production, but in my opinion has been unable to replicate the sheer charm of ""How It's Made.""

"Following bathroom renovations we are draining more ""gray water"" into our home septic system. Thanks to the disruption of drain pipes during construction, we noticed pungent gas odors coming from the bathroom roof vent.Roebic K-37-H could not have been easier to apply. It comes in a two-quart (1.89 l) container. It is a ""living"" solution of bacteria in suspension. The directions: Wait until bedtime. Open the container. Pour into toilet. Flush. Flush again. (You could help your cause a bit by filling the container with cool water and dumping that--with the product residue--into the toilet before the first flush.) Do not flush the toilet overnight.The solution starts beneficial bacteria colonies, starting in the waste pipe and right into your septic tank. Roebic claims that these bacteria are specially cultivated to resist the challenges of living in a system where all waste, including chemical waste, is disposed of.The overnight flush-and-wait allows colonies to grow in the pipe between your bathroom and the septic tank, clearing out the matter that does not make it all the way to the tank. This should result in cleaner pipes that promote an unobstructed flow to the tank.The main colonies grow and find their nourishment in the septic tank itself. Enzymes and bacteria are essential to a healthy system, as a functioning tank is meant to digest solids and break down waste products. Without this process, the tank would soon fill up with solid ""sludge"" and the septic water would find its way out. This breakdown process includes all that ""septic-safe"" toilet tissue that necessarily is flushed into the system.As water is eventually expelled from the tank, it carries the digestive bacteria into the leach field, which helps keep the leach field open and draining the water back into the water table.Bottom line: the septic gas odors disappeared within three days, and we are again confident that our system is working properly.Roebic says that K-37-H should be applied every six months, which is less often than some other treatments I have seen. We plan to do that, as it was so easy to apply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K07FW8RPGRBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MQUVKU#wasThisHelpful","R3K07FW8RPGRBR","A3QBHMMDRSC5VY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QBHMMDRSC5VY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

HOWEVER, as a film on it's own, it remakes a modern classic from 1982 and it is half that movie at best.  I would get this ONLY as a 3d blu ray and enjoy the 3d thrills in it.

We get split story about Brian Wilson in the sixties as he melts down and brain Wilson in the 1980's as he is rescued by  true love in the form of his future wife.  THe performances are Oscar worthy in this movie and there should be many nominees coming from it.  The blu ray is outstanding and it has a nice hd  picture without blemishes.

The acting is good and the story is fine , however I didn't like the storyline of King David being replaced by someone else in he biblical days.  It wasn't needed at all and David was david.  A man who MURDERED to gain another man's wife.  That is interesting enough in it's own right.  This show  however remains a solid fantasy show horror show and one of the better of the scy fy efforts still in production. This network can produce some fine series when it wants too.

"I have watched every episode of this very adult and good horror series.  This season was different than the first two because it was basically a lead in to the red dragon story.  Which will end the series on a high note. Personally I would love to see this show continue. But you must be thankful for NBC for allowing it to exist for this long!.  It was unlike anything that's ever been on tv and it will be missed by many.  This episode which I bought really take you into the red dragons mindset and we see his interaction with the monstrous Hannibal here as well.  This show has such outstanding actors that it elevates the activities each week above most shows as well.

"This 3d blu ray , puts together some very rare 3d promo films, a classic and rare cartoon ' boo moon' starring casper. And other various types of things like 3d trailers and informational type of films and weird cartoons that are figures and flowers that move around in 3d.  SO basically this is a interesting disc filled with many rarities.  NOW, some people want to watch a movie only and will not  enjoy such a effort.  However  I found this to be entertaining and a welcome addition to my 3d blu ray collection.  The cartoon alone would have cost you many thousands of dollars to own a copy of , in order to watch it in 3d.  The rest of this is worth checking out because of it's time capsule effect for sure. This does have a cool 3d puppet show in it though , but most of this is NOT short films made for entertainment purposes.  That being said , it's a important disc that preserves and allows us to see rare 3d efforts of the past.  I would say that the price is very high on this one.  But it's worth it for any 3d collector to own this.  Casual 3d fans might find this boring mainly but I didn't.  However GOG and the MASK (1961) are coming out on 3d blu ray this year.  2015.  So make sure you grab those and other great vintage 3d tiles like 'man in the dark' , 'dragonfly squadron' ,  ""the bubble'  , ""inferno',  'kiss me kate' ,  'house of wax' , 'creature from the black lagoon' and 'dial m for murder' for more great 3d experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSEFF8KGHO8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGXABLI#wasThisHelpful","R3KSEFF8KGHO8K","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So when I went to the comic store and saw a 1930's black and white comic book there  ,  I was amazed to find that it wasn't listed in the guide.  They should do something about this. HOWEVER, this book and the other editions I have read or bought throughout the years  give you lots of information in them.  I like to look at the guide and see who drew what issue and what feature ran in what series. For instance most guides won't tell  you that dr fate started in issue whatever in 'more fun comics' and ended in issue whatever.  What is the first comic with the rock group kiss in it?

Although they do NOT have the stories with art by Gio....Those will hopefully be reprinted in future volumes. The art in here is average mostly but that is ok as the stories are just fun as turok and andar get lost in a stone age dinosaur world.  And they stayed there for the next 70 issues or so and they have been brought back in new series too.  This is very kid friendly stuff although the dinosaurs are drawn the way they thought they looked in the 1950's.  Which is all wrong of course.

It's not a show that a vidiot may like though.  Vidiots are video game players who want constant action.  A vidiot can't handle any plot or character development.  I would rather be dead than a vidiot.  Oh well.  The blu ray which I do indeed own looks great as it should , with a nice hd picture.  The acting is great in this one and they did the book proud.

"You get two real 3d films here. These were both shown in 3d at the theaters!.  These were both well made kids films and they reflect the special effects of the early 00's. when they were made.  spy kids four is also in 3d and is worth owning.  You don't need to be a kid to enjoy these fun films.  The 3d is outstanding and both films are clean family fun.  Many companies could learn from this.  Too often we get one older movie for 30.00 which is really a bad idea. NO movie over ten years old should be more than 20.00 unless it's a massive special edition.  These two were to be had for only 15.00!  NOW that's a fantastic deal!.  You need a 3d tv to watch these films properly as they were filmed in that format.  The spy kids film is one of four films of the successful film series.  THe other one is simply a one off movie.  These are kids films if you can't handle that but 3d fans should absolutely add this set to their collection.  The 3d is as good as many older films like the 'bubble' which is now out on 3d blu ray too , as well as 'inferno'  and 'man in the dark'  all of them are very good 3d from the golden age of 3d.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQEFI8STPU0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009INALBS#wasThisHelpful","RGQEFI8STPU0J","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this movie only gets three stars because it has very good 3d in it.  the 3d version is much better than the flat 2d version by a long shot.  I would say ""Noah' 3d also was superior to the flat version as well.  You have to buy a europeon version of Noah to get the 3d version.  This one however has a 3d version in this package.  Now for the not so good part. The movie is rather bad and weak in many ways.  Moses is not a zealot here for his people , he doesn't directly confront pharaoh ,  as it is depicted in the bible.  God is a weird kid who needs spanking !  Why they allowed someone who is a atheist to make this story is beyond me.  The acting is good because this film has Excellent actors in it.  Top rated ones but they can't save this movie.  Even the parting of the sea of reeds.  NOT the RED SEA.  has not enough punch in it.  This film could have been as exciting as the great earlier versions if they stayed to the story and didn't try to interject today's mores into a older story.  The Hebrews NEVER believed in thou shall not kill. it said ""THOU SHALT NOT MURDER""  , they didn't hesitate to wipe out whole cities a few years later.  Back then when you invaded tribally you wiped out the enemy and took all of  it's land.  Only strong states tried to take territory and people.  Anyways. This movie in spite of the actors and good 3d is simply rather limp.  NOAH. was very exciting and wild and had great 3d. Although on a  lets stick to the bible level it was very flawed like this one too. But you could forgive it because it was relentless and exciting.  Not so this one.

Universal needs to get them out now, But at least warner is doing it well with this one.  It looks restored and stunning.  The story is a fun musical love tale with a lot of humor in it too.  You won't regret buying this one if you are 3d fan or a fan of musicals!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DW2XGDPOWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9EDGHQ#wasThisHelpful","R19DW2XGDPOWD","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this is a first class animated film that is part of the resident evil series. Which is called biohazard in japan.  This is out only in 2d in the u.s.  which completely is LAME. As this was made to be seen in 3d. It was filmed that way and many shots are designed for a 3d effect, or animated that way!  This story is decent too.  It's  a shame that few will ever know that there is a 3d edition of this movie , and that the 2d version is not the real version that was released to movie theaters in japan.  It's very expensive because of it being a limited edition 3d blu ray.  Which is not a good thing. We should have had the opportunity to get this one over here. but at least this is a region a 3d blu ray , it has the 2d version too, which means that you can watch it on your blu ray player  without a all region blu ray player.  Because JAPAN and the u.s. are in the same region.  This is much better in 3d , and it's a decent animated resident evil story. without the main female lead in it though.  I don't know if they will ever make a live action 'resident evil' movie again.  But at least you have two animated films and this one is in true 3d.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBVEWMBMAZW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE0PQTG#wasThisHelpful","R1RBVEWMBMAZW4","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another classy volume that is out from this company.  And dark horse does a great job reprinting these fine  old comics.  Gold key had some terrific comic series and the art of frank thorne really shines here.  He is a master artist and that's a big plus here.  The stories are very fun too , with Samson fighting lots of monsters and bad guys from a post nuclear war destroyed earth ,  IT looks like they used the neutron bomb which just kills people and leaves buildings standing.  The more gold key reprints I read the more I learn to love their quirkiness and very cool uniqueness!

"This is a great show and the dvd set does include many extras like , deleted scenes,  and 12 mini episodes that last a hour total.  The story is as good as the first season , however I must say the ending does go over the top. But then this is fiction isn't it?  The final shootout this time takes place at a church in new York city and after many hundreds of rounds are fired the cops never show up!  But who in spite of that the show is fast paced and fun show. This show is NO way suitable for children though.  It's a ADULT show with sex scenes and lots of violence.  And in spite of the rather wild ending is worth seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RT0ITW7BADVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IV3FLO8#wasThisHelpful","R2RT0ITW7BADVT","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You get a excellent reprint of the 'space family robinson' comic book series. This series surelyinfluenced the tv show that came out a few years later. But it's not directly related. The art is by the great Don Spiegle and that's a truly good thing. The reproduction values here are excellent too.  The first seven issues are here and they like most gold key comics were actually quite good.  Gold key went out of business but it had replaced dell and it created some of it's own comics like this one.

"This and the second miniseries were HUGE hits.  It's hard to imagine today how tv shows could be cultural events.  There wasn't many channels and this show was very well done.  At the time people were amazed at the good story which was a analogy of naziism or facism or even communism.  the acting was great and the effects were top notch for their time.  This was a real event and it's story holds  up very well today.  The remake was a disaster because it was so wishy washy unlike this one. The v aliens are well done too in this one.  The story rings true as far as people going along with horrible police state that is out to wipe people out.  The next year was another classic the second miniseries.  Then they did a ok tv series that was decent but after the two classic miniseries wasn't able to catch on.  This isn't remastered of course  , it's a dvd.  And I would welcome a blu ray of this and the second miniseries.  This was a part of peoples lives at the time as most people were familiar with it.  And it holds up well story wise and even special effects wise and this was before cgi effects!  ANother interesting fact is that the leader of the resistance is a woman!  That was a good and inspirational thing in 1983 United States as well.  I have this dvd and the rest but lets hope for a blu ray someday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WZ8R88HL5I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B8UD#wasThisHelpful","R38WZ8R88HL5I3","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The earliest ARCHIE adventures are right in this volume. And they are straight out of their time and yet they remain very funny reading.  They don't tell you what story came from what, but on the publication page they do tell you what issues they came from.  They do not reprint the covers either , which is not a good thing  But the reproduction here is great!  The stories do feature some very politically incorrect depictions of black people. As in them as stereotypes that say 'yass sir"" .  but those are only two stories or so from a whole volume here.  Basically this is a great fun read and you will laugh at these stories as well.  Reggie is barely a character here and archie looks rather beaver toothed. IN  his first story he looks like Alfred e nueman of mad magazine , which didn't exist in 1941.  He changes and has less pudgy cheeks as the comic moves on.  This is a good start and I hope that later volumes give us covers and information about what issue a story comes from.  I have a book of early shield stories from pep comics and they were good. MLJ had some great superheroes as well.  The covers of pep however reflect how things went archie crazy though.  archie and the shield share the covers and then the shield is gone and finally he vanished from the series.  SO lets  hope they do the covers for the rest of the series.  You do get the covers to 'archie comics' one and two and they didn't reprint the four funny animal stories that were used as filler in those early issues.  I don't know when they stopped using them either.  ALl in all , you would have had to pay 30,000 dollars to read these in comic book form and they wouldn't have looked as good as they do here!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THCOXHY384DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595827161#wasThisHelpful","R1THCOXHY384DT","A16XRPF40679KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16XRPF40679KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this show was revolutionary. It really was.  It was the first show where the hero was a girl and all the guys thought she was great for it.  It had a great powerful story arc too.  The movie had been a fun comedy , but this and Angel were just great well structured  shows with fantastic characters. .  They say they want to redo this show, but nothing has come of it. How could you ever top the original? You couldn't.  Even though the effects would be better than they could do in 1996, the stories and acting was top notch.  The stories here were well thought out and could be transplanted in general teen angst into any situation. You just had a horror background here.  The dvd sets are all good.

"Davis Way used to be a cop in Pine Apple, Alabama. Her name sounds like a road and the name of the town looks misspelled, but really, that‚Äôs her name and Pine Apple is indeed the town from which she hails. She used to be married. To Eddie. Twice. It didn‚Äôt work out the first time and it‚Äôs hard to figure why she married him a second time, but like a bad penny, he just keeps turning up.In the course of the second divorce from her first-and-second husband ‚Äî she refers to him as her ex-ex ‚Äî Davis and Eddie behaved badly. Badly enough to get her fired from the force by her father and for 2-way retraining orders to get slapped on Davis and her ex-ex. The juicy details of what happened are never given. I rather hope future books will flush out that piece of history.After a very long search for some kind of job, she is hired by a Biloxi casino, purportedly to discover how someone(s) is beating the machines to collect the jackpot on their Double Whammy Poker slot machines. The terms of her employment are murky. From the get-go, Davis is sure that there‚Äôs something seriously awry with the entire setup but she needs the job. She needs the paycheck.It‚Äôs hard to do your job when you aren‚Äôt sure what your job is. Harder still when nobody is who or what they appear, including Davis herself. Davis gets in deeper and deeper until she is about to be swallowed by the crime she is investigating. Eventually, with help from unexpected parties, she extracts herself from the quagmire that threatens to keep her in prison for a very long time. And she finds love. Her own double whammy.From start to finish, all four books are funny, fast-paced, witty, and ironic. With characters who have hidden depths and who also grow and change with experience. Just like real people!Davis comes from a small town, but she‚Äôs no hick. She has degrees in Computer Science and Criminology. There‚Äôs not a dumb bone in her body. She has the makings of a strong female character and that‚Äôs rare in the world of mystery writing. I like Davis Way. I liked her the first time we met and four books later, I think I like her even more. She‚Äôs bright, observant, creative, dedicated and brave. She has a lot of heart. She not only thinks out of the box, she has no boxes in which to think. She's a one-of-a-kind, unique in the world of fiction.Double Whammy was ambitious and complex and each subsequent book has expanded on this. The plots of many threads, but Gretchen Archer never misses a stitch. Her endings are satisfying and fully realized.. She has created a strong main character and a story with plenty of action. She handles a multi-faceted storyline and a lot of characters, a love story, and back stories ... and keeps track of every plot twist and turn. That‚Äôs an amazing accomplishment. And she just keeps getting better!Four good books ‚Äî fast-paced, lively, charming.She has been compared to Janet Evanovich (Stephanie Plum). There are some similarities in their writing styles, but Davis Way is a stronger character in every way. She isn‚Äôt merely funny. She has depth, expertise, intuition. She‚Äôs been brought up by a police chief father. She knows how to handle weapons and has the instincts of a real detective.Davis is a terrific sleuth and someone I'd love to hang out with. if you haven't read her books, you can take this opportunity to spend some time with Davis. You won't regret a minute of it.I loved these books and can hardly wait for number five!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5MBG64O3FX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125TXRUI#wasThisHelpful","R2D5MBG64O3FX8","A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this cooker since 2012. I hadn't realized it was more than three years until I went through my orders. It has never failed me. It makes perfect rice every time. I have also used it to bake cakes ... mixes, not ""from scratch"" ... but they all came out perfect. Absolutely perfect. I don't use it as a slow cooker because I'm afraid highly seasoned stuff like chili would leave a taste behind and possibly ruin the taste of the rice. I have also used it to steam vegetables and fish (usually salmon). It has done everything perfectly without fail. I do not use the original measuring cup. For rice, two cups of liquid to one cup of dry rice. Just like in the Chinese cookery books and never a problem. I don't make brown rice, so I can't comment on that. It still works perfectly. If you take care not to damage the teflon coating of the pot, keep it clean and dry it before you put it away, it's perfect. Three years, no problems.

"DOG BONE SOUP is the long-awaited ‚Äúrest of the story‚Äùof Shawn Daniels from the original short story, ""Pure Trash."" It's particularly long-awaited for me because as soon as I read the short story, I wanted to read this book. The only problem was, Bette hadn't yet written it.But she did it. Dog Bone Soup is available for your reading pleasure. And what a pleasure it is.Bette has the purest, freshest writing style I‚Äôve read in many a long year. Reading her prose is like peering into an exceptionally clear, deep pool. It looks like the bottom is close enough to touch, but those waters run deep.Bette Stevens is a class act, an author who knows how to tell a story. Her characters are real, so true to life, they practically leap off the page. In Dog Bone Soup, style and the story are blended to perfection.I've read a lot of books about rural poverty and for some reason, all those stories are set in the south. This is as far from south as you can get and a timely reminder that poverty is not regional. It's everywhere, from the biggest cities to the hidden hamlets where tourists never go.Shawn Daniels' story is wonderful story. It‚Äôs growing up and coming of age for a poor kid in a dysfunctional family. His world is cold and hardscrabble. A drunken father, a vanishing mother. Foster parents with no love to share, teachers who can't see past patches and poverty. Yet somehow Shawn forges a road of his own. Armed with courage, humor, and grit, he grows into a strong young man with solid values. And a future.Sometimes, very little is enough.No matter how it sounds, there's nothing depressing about this story. How come? Because Shawn Daniels hasn't a shred of self-pity in him. Despite the challenges he faces, Shawn is never down. Not depressed, discouraged, broken, or beaten. This kid has grit. Determination. A solid grip on his own worth.Where does it come from? Mom, sometimes. A few others who see Shawn's value and give him a hand along his path. A personal, hard-wired toughness that lets him see past the life he is living it to the life he wants -- and for which he is willing to work. Mostly, it is Shawn's own sharp intelligence which enables him to understand his world. It lets him trust his judgment without bogging down in unearned guilt. He makes smart decisions.It's a great story -- and it's far from over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MY6SEUGVPF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5RMUDK#wasThisHelpful","R1MY6SEUGVPF2","A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of this series for some years. I have read all but maybe one or two of these wonderful modern Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell novels. I have enjoyed every one of them and hope Ms. King never stops writing them.The first of the series I read -- which is not the first book in the series -- was set in Jerusalem. I was actually searching for a different book which has (almost) the same name -- Oh! Jerusalem, by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (another good one, worth your time).I lived in Jerusalem for nine years. Reading the book delighted me with its descriptive richness and the accuracy of the geography. I've read a lot of books supposedly set in Jerusalem and this was the first one I felt captured it, not just physically but spiritually. I could smell the spices and see the sun on the stone.Dreaming Spies is the latest in Laurie King's brilliant modern tales of Sherlock Holmes and his intrepid and scholarly wife, Mary Russell. While on a sea voyage to Japan -- intended as a vacation -- the journey transforms into a convoluted, multi-faceted hunt for a blackmailer, a priceless book, and a document that can save an empire.As the intensity of the chase increases, Holmes and Mary form a peculiar alliance with a mysterious young Japanese woman. Twists and turns of plot abound. Nobody and nothing is who or what they seem to be. It's impossible to know who is the hound, and who the fox.I have always wanted to visit Japan and now, I feel as if I have. I was originally planning to read it as text, but this has not been a good year for my reading print. I finally gave in and bought the audiobook. I'm glad I did. Jenny Sterlin, who has been the narrator on this entire series, is wonderful. As she always is. She will always be the voice of Mary Russell to me. The wife of Homes and the teller of this and all of Laurie King's Sherlock Holmes-Mary Russell books.You don't have to read the books in order, though it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did. Each book in the series stands on its own.Laurie King is an exceptionally literate writer. The elegance of her language is one of her most attractive qualities as an author. In many places, her prose is almost poetry, lyrical and as silky as a rose petal. I recommend the book and the series. If you like mysteries which you cannot predict, enjoy vivid descriptions of exotic climes, I think I can say without reservation you will like her novels.If you always hoped Sherlock might meet a nice woman, get married, and get a life -- in these books he does exactly that. All of your favorite Holmes characters will drop by for visits. And he does it without losing any of his detecting edge.

"Civ III would not display properly (or run at all) on my Alienware gaming laptop. Definitely a graphics conflict. I think the graphics are too old and too low resolution for this machine. CIV IV will run, but the audio hisses and locks the machine. The ONLY thing that has ever caused this machine to lock up. These are not games for a high end, high res gaming computer.

"Our intermittent connection problem went critical. We had been having connection issues since before Christmas, but I thought it was an outside problem. Charter being Charter, as it were.It took a bit of tracking down, but eventually, we realized that the old Linksys was in its sixth year, which for computer gear so critical to everything we use, is ancient. And it was failing.Charter has been ramping up their broadband speed for the past year, so I knew it was likely the old router couldn't handle the higher speed. But it was more than that. It was not broadcasting a strong enough signal. Diagnosis: Tired old router needs replacement and honorable retirement.Amazon isn't cheaper for everything, but for electronics, they usually have the best prices and selection. If you have Amazon Prime, they are offer the fastest delivery at no charge.I'm a real fan of Amazon. They honor their promises. If you don't get your package, they send another. If the product doesn't work, they refund your money or send a replacement -- your choice. They are nice when you call with a problem. Rather than go over to our local Best Buy or Walmart, we went online.We were right. Amazon had great prices on a huge selection of routers. There were so many to choose from ... and the technology has changed so much since the last time we installed a router ... most of our time was spent trying to figure out what the descriptions meant, and which router was the right one for our house.Owen said NetGear was easiest to install. Even though we'd been using Linksys for so many years. Since he was doing the installation, I saw no reason to argue the point.We settled on NETGEAR AC750 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R6050). At $81.99 plus tax, with free 2-day shipping, it seemed likely to do the job. We ordered it on Saturday and it (surprise!) arrived Monday morning. No, I didn't pay extra for speedy shipping. They are just very fast.It's installed. It took about an hour, including some hassling with the wireless printer and some more hassling with the Roku. There's one more Roku in the bedroom I will have to reset plus three Kindles. My son has hooked up his laptop and tablet. My three computers and my husband's two are up and running.You think we have enough wireless stuff around here?The router works really well. No dead spots in the house anymore! Not one, not anywhere. Finally, we have full coverage through both floors and in every room.What could NetGear do to improve the experience? Provide better instructions!Every problem we encountered was not a problem. It was just something for which no instructions or explanation is provided. I know everyone thinks tech writers are obsolete. I AM a tech writer. But seriously, folks. How much could it cost to hire a tech writer for a couple of days to write proper, English-language instructions? We work cheap!Reading through reviews on Amazon, I'm betting 90% of the complaints were failures to understand what to do. Better instructions would solve the problem.Can you say ""Happy Ending?""

This is one of those times!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9GWWR21WF97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFD0O0I#wasThisHelpful","RR9GWWR21WF97","A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amazon launched the new generation of Kindles at the end of September 2013. I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7‚Ä≥ tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said ""That's it, I'm done."" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this. Unless you plan to use it plugged in, charge it after every use ... nope. Doesn't live up to its PR or its predecessor.Sorry, Amazon. The HDX isn't ready for prime time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17WEBSQEGQOZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWYQ9YE#wasThisHelpful","R17WEBSQEGQOZ2","A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a mere 19 pages, Nancy Christie paints an amazingly vivid portrait. A complete world.A woman of indeterminate age, Alice is trapped in the walls of her mother's house. She has surrendered her life. Nothing exists but tending her bedridden shrew of a mother. Bereft of a life outside, she escapes by reading -- consuming books. Literally.Alice is beyond despair. She has lost touch with her own soul. Her life is empty and ugly. No joy, hope or companionship. Alice dreams and reads of faraway places. Dreaming has morphed into literally eating the pages she reads, as if by consuming words, they will overpower her misery and replace reality.Nancy Christie is a painter with words, creating remarkable images. She writes tightly, nothing wasted. Rarely have I read anything as evocative. So much in conveyed in so few words. Too soon over. I avoided short stories for years because they left me feeling unsatisfied, but Alice In Wonderland is a most satisfying morsel, a world in a few heartbeats.The only thing that could have improved this story would have been another story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMEE1C8BR2LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GW9D8DO#wasThisHelpful","RHMEE1C8BR2LO","A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F2GLVFRNV7JJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess in all my shopping for the right price, I didn't notice these were the minis, so there was some disappointment there, but it was entirely my fault.  Still a decent deal for the money.  My only real complaint is the taste.  Perhaps it's because the 4mg of nicotine is packed into a smaller lozenge, but there's only a slight mint taste compared to the larger lozenges, and there's also a strong medicinal flavor that the mint doesn't quite cover up.

"I could have sworn I'd written out the review for this already, but clearly somewhere I failed.  In any case, this is the coolest little charger I've bought.  I figured it would be handy to have for the occasional power outage or when I'm on the go and without something to plug into.  We don't lose power often, but when it happens, it's always around the time my phone is nearly dead, so this little guy is going to be a lifesaver in that respect.  Better, though, is the fact that it features an incredibly bright flashlight -- super useful if power is out at night.

"""Highest Quality"" is definitely a bit of a stretch.  With just two washes, these have pilled up enough that I wouldn't want to put them on a guest bed or give them as a gift.  I haven't had any of the tearing problems that others have complained about, but I haven't had them that long, either, and the material is exceptionally thin, which leads me to believe they won't hold up over time.  My biggest problem is simply that the material is not breathable and therefore traps body heat.

"This is exactly what I needed!  So many of my devices have USB charger cables, but plugging them all into my laptop or having to use multi-outlet surge protector strip to charge them all at once was getting old.  I didn't even know something like this existed until I started searching for a more practical solution, and this little guy fixes all those problems.  It's small enough to toss in my purse or laptop bag and carry with me, and with both 2A (x1) and 1A (x3) ports, it works for several different devices.  Best of all, though, is that it doesn't feel like it's heating up too much, even when I've got multiple devices connected to it and pulling a charge.  The speed's pretty great as well, which I have to say I was a bit worried about, but it's powerful enough to handle it.

"When I saw this cutting board, I knew it would make a great gift for my little sister.  She's always whipping up new recipes, but she doesn't have all the quality kitchen implements she wants -- and can't really afford them all.  And this one is just about perfect.First, this cutting board is THE PERFECT SIZE.  It's not so big that you have to clear the entire counter to use it, and it's not so small that one tomato does it in.  The handle is a great addition (wish all my cutting boards had this!) to keep your hands clean when you're pushing chopped veggies off the board and into a skillet.  And the stand is simply genius.  Not only does it ensure perfect drying without having to oddly prop the board against something or take up too much counter space, but it doesn't take away from the design and doesn't add some weird extension to the board that you have to work around.  My favorite part, though, is just how it looks.  I happen to love the look of wooden cutting boards, but this bamboo one is just sooooo pretty.

"If you've got terrible vision, you know that sunglasses are always a bit of a challenge.  Either you've got to find something that fits over your regular glasses, or you've got to spend a ton of money on prescription shades.  I actually have a nice pair of prescription sunglasses, but they're pretty old, and the lenses are small -- they do an okay job, but something that blocks more light would be awesome.  Aside from not wanting to pay for new prescription sunglasses, these looked like a good bet, since the frame cups over the eyes and around the sides, so I thought I'd give 'em a try.  And I'm really quite impressed.  First, my regular glasses are a weird shape.  They're rather flat, short, and wide, so I had my doubts about these fitting comfortably over them.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about, as these wear-overs are generously and smartly sized to accommodate my strange frames.  I also love the wrap around bit, which nicely blocks sun from the sides -- and with little lenses on the sides to boot!  The one thing that takes some getting used to is that these sit a little further down my nose than I'm used to.  It makes sense, since they have to sit in front of my regular glasses, but after a few decades of pushing my glasses back on my nose, I have to stop myself from reflexively shoving these back.  Realistically, though, the change is minimal -- it's not like they're perched on the end of my nose.  The tinting is also just about perfect, dark enough to block out the insane Texas sun and light enough to see well even when it's a bit cloudy.  And surprisingly, they don't look nearly as unfashionable as I expected.  While I'm definitely more concerned with comfort and practicality than fashion, I wasn't looking forward to wearing what I've always considered ""old man shades.""  However, these are well-designed aesthetically, and they end up just looking like smart, sporty sunglasses.  All in all, I'm really impressed, and my old prescription shades are going to be collecting dust from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217J023HF1PII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017A6R5EU#wasThisHelpful","R217J023HF1PII","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The problem with having an iPhone is that it requires a different charging cord than pretty much every other device on the planet.  Where I used to be able to take one cord with me, knowing it would power my phone, my brother's phone, and my Kindle, I now have to take two.  It's not the biggest inconvenience in the world, but it does mean I'm always double-checking to make sure I grabbed both cords before leaving the house.  This  cable is the perfect solution.The lightning piece is attached to the micro USB with a little springy cord, ensuring that I won't lose that all important attachment, and the charge power/time is on par with the cables I received with my original devices.  It is a little difficult to pry the lightning attachment off when switching to micro USB, but I'm not sure that's something to really complain about.  The fact that it attaches so tightly ensures a powerful connection and no chance of it simply falling off if knocked around a bit.Seriously, why are people even buying separate cables?

"Piper‚Äôs aunt disappeared without a trace when Piper was just a teenager, so she‚Äôs shocked when she finds out her aunt has now passed and left her a sizeable inheritance.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to the shock (and fear) that sets in when a notorious loan shark and his enforcer show up at her door and demand the money.The Verdict:  If I hadn‚Äôt already read the previous books in the series, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have grabbed this one.  Frankly, the synopsis would have sounded a bit far-fetched to me (which, admittedly, is ridiculous, considering the number of happily ever afters I read about each year), and I would have gone for something more conventional romance instead.  However, having met the people of Covendale already, and having more than a little interest in the scrumptious Dawson brothers, I really didn‚Äôt care what it was about, so long as it served up another dish of Dawson.  Surprisingly (to me and my ridiculous pre-judgment), the plot didn‚Äôt seem so over-the-top once I got to reading.  After all, we‚Äôve already been made to understand that Jonah is into some seedy s***, and finding out more about his not so legal employment just makes him ‚Äî not to mention the town‚Äôs opinion of him ‚Äî make more sense.When tragedy struck the Dawson siblings back when most of them were still just kids, Jonah stepped up and did what was necessary to take care of his family.  Unfortunately, what was necessary was also horribly violent and illegal, and since that day, he‚Äôs been the kneecap breaking enforcer for a vile loan shark.  He‚Äôs been able to remain somewhat emotionally removed from the unlucky borrowers he‚Äôs sent after, but the one thing he could never do was hit a woman.Piper has been through some kind of hell.  Abandoned by her mother, she was left to be raised by her aunt, a woman she thought the world of.  But then her aunt came home terribly hurt and clearly hiding something.  And before Piper knew what was going on, her aunt simply disappeared.  It‚Äôs been forever since Piper was left on her own, but the aunt she assumed had forgotten about her has now left her  a huge inheritance ‚Äî and a huge problem.I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Dawson‚Äôs Honor is my favorite book in the Welcome to Covendale series so far. Jonah, whom we met in previous books, is a darker character than the other siblings.  He‚Äôs not some innocent who‚Äôs been coerced into doing something bad, either, though his enforcer job is much more ruthless than he would have chosen, had another option been available.  He‚Äôs hurt plenty of people, but he won‚Äôt hurt a woman, so when he‚Äôs faced with no other choice, he runs off with Piper, trying to stay ahead of his boss and keep both himself and Piper alive.  But their growing attraction is complicating things, and a steamy relationship soon develops in the midst of all that danger.Dawson‚Äôs Honor has tons of action, incredibly hot romance, and a heavy dose of mystery, and it‚Äôs easily the most entertaining book of the series.  I was so caught up in the drama that I didn‚Äôt even pause to mark any syntax issues, which is saying a lot.  If you like your men hot and your stories exciting, this one is a wonderful, quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC450HLE631P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQA1P3G#wasThisHelpful","R3VC450HLE631P","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the encouragement of a friend and a few too many drinks at a masquerade party, Livi finds herself grabbing a quickie with a stranger in a closet.  Running off without his name ‚Äî or her underwear ‚Äî she assumes she'll never see him again.  But strapped for cash under crushing student loan payments, she hits up a bar for a part-time job, only to discover that the owner is no stranger.The Verdict:  Livi's life hasn't been easy since graduating college.  Finding a steady job in her area of expertise isn't an issue; it's the student loan payments that are killing her.  Add in a car that needs repair, overdue bills, and no other options, she makes the rounds at local bars, looking for a job that will help her catch up financially while working around her day job.  When a local dive bar gives her a shot, she's determined to prove herself.  She just never expected the man behind the bar to be the very same man she shared a few hot minutes with in a closet.Hendrix and his brothers are still grieving the loss of their mother and dealing with the father who never really gave a damn.  But they're doing okay for themselves, and Hendrix is fixing up the they own and beginning to show a decent profit.  Uninterested in a serious relationship, he has one hot tryst in a closet at a party with a girl he never expects to see again, but he soon learns that the very same woman he hired to help out on busy nights is the one he hasn't been able to get off his mind.To be honest, when I got to this book in my TBR list, I was having second thoughts.  It looked like it might be a bit dark for my taste, and I expected it to be rather formulaic.  To my surprise, it wasn't long before Hendrix turned all the usual tropes upside down and delivered something refreshingly different.  Aside from the hot and heavy one-night-stand, there was so much to the story and the way the characters behaved that I rarely get enough of in this genre.Hendrix is definitely a rough around the edges kind of guy.  He's all alpha male, heavily tattooed, not above throwing a few punches, and certainly not inclined to engage in any committed relationships.  But he's an all-around decent guy, up front with women about his intention to stay unattached, and immediately willing to step up when someone needs help.  He's also enamored with Livi, the funny, sexy, hilarously awkward girl who comes into his bar looking for a job.Livi surprised me.  There were so many things about her character that could have turned her into a cookie-cutter romance novel heroine.  Yes, she was down on her luck financially, a hard worker, and opposed to taking handouts.  But she laughed when least expected, had faith that she could take care of herself, and didn't let her rather traumatic past get in the way of living her life.  She wasn't looking for a relationship and didn't exactly trust men, but she was surprisingly open to the new feelings developing the more she got to know Hendrix.Their relationship was just as unpredictable as Hendrix and Livi were.  When I expected her to overreact to a conveniently misleading scene, she did just the opposite.  When I expected Hendrix to deny his feelings for Livi and push her away, he did the opposite.  When I just knew that everything was going to blow up in their faces, the way it always does in romance novels before the happily ever after is served up, Livi and Hendrix were generally open and honest with each other, and they didn't fall into the same cliched trap.  Even the cause of Livi's adolescent trauma surprised me, and while it would have been easy to label all the characters with the same stereotypical pen, nothing about them fit the tired old standard.Their romance, of course, was crazy hot.  But instead of heading into gratuitously obscene territory, Livi and Hendrix's sexier moments were punctuated by laughter and a great deal of consideration for each other.  Now that I think about it, it's kind of sad that I now expect every romance novel I read to follow the same boring plot, but Hendrix proves that there are still authors out there willing to give us readers stories that are both classic and unconventional.  Hendrix is everything I didn't know I was looking for in a romance, and I can't wait to see what's next in the series!***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79EC9OY65ZPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YW4S19C#wasThisHelpful","R79EC9OY65ZPC","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When elementary school teacher Sunny‚Äôs neighbor disappears and a strange man takes up residence in the empty house next door, she and her book club friends have plenty to gossip about.  He‚Äôs mysterious and sexy, and Edna swears she saw him carrying a gun, but no one can figure out why he‚Äôs really there ‚Äî or what happened to Walter.  Despite her friends‚Äô best efforts to resurrect her love life with blind dates, Sunny can‚Äôt keep her eyes off the man next door, but giving into her attraction might lead to happily ever after, or it might just pair her up with a killer.The Verdict: Another Saturday Night and I Ain‚Äôt Got Nobody just might be the most fun I‚Äôve had reading in years.Sunny‚Äôs been in a dating rut for far too long, but while she‚Äôd love to find that special someone, she‚Äôs not too worried about it.  Her book club friends, on the other hand, have their own opinions on the matter.  Sunny reluctantly agrees to let them set her up on a series of blind dates, and in no time, Sunny‚Äôs dull summer turns slapstick crazy.We‚Äôre first introduced to the best secondary character in fiction history.  Edna is one of Sunny‚Äôs neighbors, a meddlesome, elderly woman who isn‚Äôt exactly known for her tact.  She watches the comings and goings on their street like an amateur detective, coming up with all kinds of screwball theories, but she‚Äôs got a heart of gold.  It‚Äôs Edna who first notices the mysterious man who moves into their missing neighbor‚Äôs house in the middle of the night.  Sunny notices him, too, but while she‚Äôs aware of Edna‚Äôs suspicions, it‚Äôs not Jake‚Äôs gun that catches her eye first.Jake seems like a nice enough guy, and he‚Äôs more than a little easy on the eyes, but there‚Äôs too much Sunny doesn‚Äôt know about him.  So while Sunny enjoys the view, she and the Pleasant Valley Page Turners book club do a little snooping and try to figure him out ‚Äî and fix Sunny‚Äôs dating life while they‚Äôre at it.  Their fix, however, is practically a comedy of errors, and I was so busy laughing at the scrapes Sunny found herself in that I didn‚Äôt have time to wish she and Jake would just get to it already.Another Saturday Night and I Ain‚Äôt Got No Body plays out like an awesome movie centered around a group of women friends who have no real boundaries.  Through it all, Edna provides constant shock and hilarity, there are some rather tender ‚Äútrue friendship‚Äù moments wrapped up in lots of lively fun, and the mystery surrounding Jake just gets deeper.  Throw in some romance, more sleuthing, a possible stalker, and poor Sunny‚Äôs dates falling apart, and you‚Äôve got yourself an incredibly entertaining read.***FicCentral received this book from The Romance Reviews for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1LWFMGNYJPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQPJ924#wasThisHelpful","RW1LWFMGNYJPD","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, to be honest, I didn‚Äôt even read the synopsis before downloading this book from my local library.  I went searching for more books by authors whose work I love, saw some by Maisey Yates, and hit the button.  Best blind pick ever!I‚Äôve read a couple of books in which there‚Äôs a mix-up at the fertility clinic, but this just might be the freshest take on it I‚Äôve seen.  Instead of following the romance novel formula, the characters in Unexpected acted very much like I might expect from real people simply trying to deal with a very messed up situation, and as soon as I caught on that these fictional characters weren‚Äôt acting terribly‚Ä¶ well, fictional, I was all in!Kelsey‚Äôs like a lot of women whose biological clock is ticking with no man in sight.  But thanks to her successful career, she‚Äôs got the means to do something about it.  With months of careful planning behind her, she sets off to conceive a child via artificial insemination.  The last thing she expects is for some cowboy to show up at her door, claiming to be the father of her unborn child.When Cole finds out the sperm he banked has been inadvertently given to some random woman hoping to conceive a child, he‚Äôs confused and furious.  But unlike what I expected from him, he didn‚Äôt lay into Kelsey about it.  His conflicting feelings didn‚Äôt override his compassion for the woman who was, like him, a victim of circumstance, and it showed in the way he approached her and his gentle determination to be in his child‚Äôs life.Having read enough romance novels to predict a lot of plot turns, I was surprised (pleasantly so!) that Cole reacted the way he did.  It was obvious that he had no idea how to handle what life had now thrown at him, but he didn‚Äôt go all ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna call my lawyer!‚Äù the way I thought he would.  In fact, he never once threatened to fight for custody or throw any more of a wrench in Kelsey‚Äôs plans than the mix-up already had.  He also didn‚Äôt immediately fall in love with her or begin demanding that she change her plans to include him.  He simply worried about her and asked for a chance to be a part of his kid‚Äôs life.Kelsey‚Äôs reaction to Cole is both sad and comical.  She‚Äôs suffering through morning/noon/night sickness, and she reacts almost robotically to his sudden presence.  She‚Äôs sick, looks like death warmed over, and has virtually no interest at all in anything past keeping some food down.  That introduction set the tone for Kelsey and Cole for the rest of the story.Of course, these two had to spend some time together if they were ever to fall in love, so Cole invites Kelsey to his family‚Äôs sprawling ranch.  It‚Äôs the perfect solution, since it‚Äôs a tourist destination, giving Kelsey some privacy in a guest cabin while putting them within walking distance of each other.  Neither is really willing to give love a shot, though, despite the fact that they begin to get along great and have some pretty strong chemistry.It always bothers me a bit when a potential couple simply writes each other off because someone long ago screwed them over.  For Cole, it was his ex-wife, the same one he initially banked the sperm for in an effort to keep her happy.  For Kelsey, it was a cheating ex.  I can certainly understand their both wanting to be cautious rather than dive in with blinders on, but they both allowed single past experiences to get in the way of a great chance at a new relationship.  Fortunately, their friendship bloomed, and it was clear that these two belonged together.I loved the way Cole, even though the news of a child was not welcome, didn‚Äôt fly off the handle or try to make things difficult for Kelsey.  In fact, short of promising his eternal love (till the end, at least), he was only interested in Kelsey‚Äôs comfort and happiness.  He wasn‚Äôt willing to put his heart on the line, but he also wasn‚Äôt going to walk away from Kelsey when she clearly needed someone.  I also liked the way things played out with respect to her parents.  Coming from a very traditional family, Kelsey knew her parents would give her grief upon learning of her decision to be a single mother, and while I can‚Äôt understand any parents who act that way, it lent another bit of realism to the story.  Parental approval is huge in just about anyone‚Äôs life.Unexpected was exactly that ‚Äî unexpected. It was unexpectedly funny, sweet, and even steamy without going over the top.  The plot, while not original, have the author plenty of room to play with originality, and she created two awesome characters (and a host of awesome secondary characters) who were incredibly intriguing.  If you like your romance with a side of Stetson and Wranglers, Unexpected is the book for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TIFF2GQAM8WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XNY8S6#wasThisHelpful","R3TIFF2GQAM8WK","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With no warning, the world as ten year old Beatrice knows it ends.  After weeks spent in a bunker her parents fortunately had the foresight to build into their home, it‚Äôs clear that everything has changed.  Now they must make their own way, grow their own food, and defend themselves against roving nomadic scavengers who would take what little they have left to survive.The Verdict:  I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting when I picked this one up; I think I just wanted something different.  And The Blast is different in the very best way.Beatrice is just a child when she spots the giant mushroom cloud that announces the end of American society.  Rushed into a concrete bunker by her parents, she hides out with her family and a couple of neighbors, not fully understanding just what has happened.  When they emerge, their entire world has changed, and the threat is no longer nuclear bombs but random strangers against whom they must defend their lives and their resources.In The Blast we see Beatrice lose her childhood overnight, and then we watch her grow up into a resourceful young woman in a changed world.  It‚Äôs interesting to see things unfold through her eyes; she‚Äôs just old enough to see clearly what‚Äôs happening around her but just young enough that she‚Äôs still completely reliant on her parents to interpret the world for her.  Her parents weren‚Äôt what I would call Doomsday Preppers.  While they had a bunker and some ways to provide for themselves, they didn‚Äôt have a whole underground mansion outfitted for years of survival.  Fortunately, they had guns, first to defend themselves and then to hunt, and they were more than capable of growing a garden and maintaining the basics for survival.Unlike other post-apocalyptic stories I‚Äôve read, Beatrice‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt set out for parts unknown or wait for the government to rescue them.  They just sort of hunker down and continue their lives on their property just outside of town.  In this way, we see more of the normal day-to-day life after the bombs, with threats coming in the form of armed and violent scavengers as opposed to makeshift militias, zombies, or plague victims.  Over time, they find other survivors like themselves, some lost and still alive thanks to nothing but dumb luck and circumstance, and together they become a small circle of makeshift families.Beatrice‚Äôs initial coming of age destroys her innocence in an instant.  Not only does she find herself killing in defense of herself and her family, but she also watches someone she loves die because there is simply no medical help available.  These two events in fairly quick succession send her mind to a dark place, but she eventually emerges as a strong, capable teen.  Of course, no story of growing up would be complete without the bickering between friends, a crush, and wondering what the future will bring.  It‚Äôs nearly impossible for her to dream of a happily ever after, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she doesn‚Äôt grow into wanting someone for herself.I feel like if I list out all the things that were so wonderful about this story, I‚Äôll end up spoiling it.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking, hopeful, and so damned terrifying all at once, and scenes play out as simply and as poignantly as they do in the non-fiction world.  In Beatrice‚Äôs mind, we struggle to comprehend the sudden absence of civilization, seek normalcy in the remnants of society, and press on in an effort to survive and perhaps thrive.  I would imagine this is the most realistic post-apocalyptic story I‚Äôve ever read, though I hope I never get to confirm that.  With life, loss, and eventually love, The Blast quite frankly blew me away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8FBUQ3RQQHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1312421886#wasThisHelpful","R2D8FBUQ3RQQHR","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carly Denton's background is questionable at best, but she's made something of herself, despite her parents' worst efforts.  Raised by a philandering father and a mother who couldn't bring herself to leave him, she's used to her family being the subject of small town gossip and tear-drenched scenes, so she conducts herself with careful decisions and all the dignity she can muster.  But there's one cowboy who gets under her skin like no other.ButFor a final copy (assuming my library hasn't started packing ARCs), Unbuttoned had a surprising number of typos and syntax mistakes.  Most of them were just obviously typing errors, like he instead of her, and sentences where you could tell something had been reworded because they left one of the wrong words in.  It didn't ruin the story, but it does show a lack of attention to detail, and if Maisey Yates weren't such a great storyteller, I probably would have passed early judgement and bailed.The Verdict:  Having loved some of Maisey Yates's more recent books, I couldn't pass this series up when I found it at my local library.  I half-expected it to be a little disappointing, given that it's a few years old, but as it turns out, I had no reason to worry.Carly's childhood was spent watching the shameful behavior of her parents, a father who made no secret of his affairs and a mother who thew crying tantrums about them for the whole town to see.  Determined to avoid that same fate, she's changed from the little girl who played in the dirt and become a woman whose suits are always perfectly pressed, whose hair is never out of place, and whose emotions will never attract the attention of the town busybodies.  It seems that only Lucas, the cowboy who reminds her too much of her father, can ruffle her feathers.Lucas remembers the Carly as his best friend's little sister, but she's almost someone completely different now.  He knows where she came from, who her parents were, and that's never bothered him.  In fact, his home life was even worse, which is why he practically grew up in Carly's house when they were all kids together.  But now when he sees her, she acts like a shrew, like he's the last person in the world she wants to see, and he figures that can only mean two things.  Either she truly can't stand him, or she feels a lot more for him than he wants to admit.In many ways, Carly is stuck in the past, while Lucas is just trying to move forward with his life.  But he soon realizes that the frosty looks Carly gives him have some heat behind them, and he can't help but push her buttons.  While they have undeniable chemistry, though, getting Carly to stop worrying about what everyone else thinks and start worrying about what she wants for herself is the real challenge.  And it certainly doesn't help that she watched him go through a string of girlfriends when they were younger.  In her mind, he might be just as bad as her father.While Lucas didn't have a grand old childhood, it seems that Carly has suffered more from hers.  Watching her begin to give in, and seeing how genuine Lucas was about his feelings for her, is the stuff of great romance.  The plot's pretty simple ‚Äî two people trying to deny their attraction and growing feelings for one another ‚Äî but the story itself is lots of fun.  Equal parts funny, hot, sad, and romantic, Unbuttoned was a nice surprise and a great, quick romance read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHX3OUQOV0Q4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XNY6OW#wasThisHelpful","RHX3OUQOV0Q4W","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Andrew and Emma meet as lonely, somewhat awkward teenagers, a sweet infatuation begins.  Within a few classes and a few weeks, the sparks of first love glow brightly, and it seems they have, at this young age, found the road to happily ever after.  But problems bigger than any teenager can bear and one tragic decision change the course of their lives forever.  Split apart and left to move on, neither is prepared for the path on which Fate leads them when they come face to face five years later.The Verdict: I have a unique problem whenever I get read to another of Ginger Scott's books.  You see, I know that no matter what the story is about or where the characters take me, every single book I read afterward will be disappointing.  So I find myself rushing through the other books on my virtual shelf, trying to get them out of the way before I open the book that I know will outshine them all.  And Wicked Restless is most certainly that book.I've never been a fan of stories in which I'm introduced to the characters when they are young and somewhat innocent, and then thrown forward several years when they are reunited, older, and usually bitter.  It's always an odd shift for me, and I end up feeling like I've had something taken away from the story I anticipated reading.  However, I didn't even glance at the summary before grabbing this book, and even if I had, it wouldn't have mattered.  Andrew and Emma's story was just as amazing as everything else Ginger Scott writes.When we first meet Emma, she's leading a complicated and sheltered life, though we don't get the real details of it until later.  Her parents are more protective than one might expect, and Emma is careful not to break any rules or stray from their guidance.  But then she meets Andrew, the sweet and handsome boy in her P.E. class, and their sweetly innocent love for each other blooms.  Their relationship is as adorable as they are, youthfully unblemished and beautiful.  But one tragic night, the kind of thing that could happen to anyone throws everything into turmoil, and before they can even digest what's happened, Andrew is taking the blame, and they find themselves separated.When tragedy struck, Andrew stepped up to protect Emma, though he really didn't know what he was protecting her from.  That sacrifice was brutal, though, sending him away from his family and into a youth reform system as dark as any prison.  And though he tried to keep in touch, she never responded, disappearing from his life almost as if she'd never existed.  Five years later, though, he gets the shock of his life when he finds her laughing and dancing in a club not far from where he's now enrolled in college.Andrew and Emma's story is beautiful and heartbreaking, and while the situation is complicated, it never feels contrived.  Consumed by bitterness over her apparent abandonment of him, Andrew reacts without thinking, intent only on hurting Emma the way she hurt him.  Driven by the need for revenge, he strikes up a relationship with Emma's roommate Lindsay, using their friendship to paint Emma into a corner and forcing her to see him with another girl.  Needless to say, that doesn't go well, and everyone gets hurt in the process.Emma is as confused and hurt as Andrew is, but not for the reasons he thinks.  As far as she knows, he disappeared, and watching him now romance her best friend is excruciating.  This sort of scenario would probably have driven me nuts in any other book, but Ginger Scott has a way of laying it out in which you can't help but understand and feel for everyone, even when they're acting irrationally and emotionally, and you know it won't end happily.It takes a while, since neither of them is really willing to lay their hearts out there, but the pieces slowly begin to fall into place, and Emma and Andrew start to realize that the circumstances of their past were absolutely out of their control.  They still have that bond from their younger years, and as messy as Andrew's vengeful actions have made things, they're unable to stay away from each other.  Watching them let go of the past and open up to a possible future together is the epitome of angsty, sweet romance.Wicked Restless is an incredible journey through the innocence of first love, the pain of abandonment and judgement, and the bittersweet tenderness of reconciliation.  Andrew and Emma's story is complex, and their ways of handling adversity are realistically immature.  I'm not sure I've ever been so heartbroken over and invested in a couple, and my only disappointment is that their story didn't continue for another thousand or so pages.  I realize my review is a bit vague, skipping over the major details and plot twists, but there's simply no way I can portray them with the depth that Ginger Scott does.  Whether you're a fiend for angst or a fan of innocent love, Wicked Restless is the perfect love story.  And quite frankly, if you've never read a romance by Ginger Scott, you're missing out an everything that makes the genre so addictive.***FicCentral received this book from Wordsmith Publicity for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278OBGNHBC9ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UFJP5U#wasThisHelpful","R278OBGNHBC9ZJ","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works much better than I expected.  Arrived fully assembled -- all I had to do was pull off the protective plastic and stick it on the dash.  I was concerned that it wouldn't attach well to the pebble-grained dashboard (like most of us have), but that wasn't an issue at all.  In fact, the suction cup holds so well that even after releasing the lever, it took a bit of a tug to get it off.  Of course, since it uses no adhesive, it leaves no trace of itself behind, either.  As for how it holds the phone... that, too, is just about perfect.  It grips well around my thick iPhone case, and the angle of the phone can be adjusted pretty much any way I want it to face.

"The last thing Leda is looking for is a man in her life.  Been there, done that, has the baby to prove it.  Young and single, Leda's determined to take care of her daughter on her own, and so far, she's managing well.  But when an old dog keeps wandering over to the neighbor's property, she has little choice but to get to know the handsome cowboy next door.The Verdict:  I have to say that this story surprised me.  I think I went in expecting something more standard, but Leda is certainly not your typical country romance heroine, and while Eric might want to be her white knight, she's more than capable of handling things on her own.  It was certainly a welcome departure from the typical stories I read.At twenty-one, Leda has found herself trying to raise her infant daughter on her own.  Thinking she was making a smart, pretty responsible decision, she fell head over heels for an older, stable man who wasn't nearly as committed as she thought he was.  Now on her own, she's determined to give her daughter a wonderful life without any help or interference from the man who didn't bother to stick around.Eric isn't looking for a relationship, either.  But he's amused by and fascinated with Leda immediately upon meeting her.  She's unlike anyone he's ever met, and he's certainly attracted to her, but she's got more baggage than he bargained for.  A former bull rider, Eric's now an agent, used to getting the best options for his clients.  And when he realizes Leda's not only lacking in moral support from her ex but also financial support, he wants to step up and help.  That, of course, is when these two start becoming more involved than either of them intended.While I never fully warmed to Leda, she was definitely one of the more interesting characters I've met in a story.  She's spunky, capable, and ‚Äî even though she's got some self-confidence issues as a result of her previous relationship ‚Äî stronger than you'd expect.  She's also managing rather well on her own, having worked out a good place to live, loyal friends, and a way to make her own way in the world.  Eric is a good deal older than she is, though not enough that it's scandalous.  And almost as soon as he realizes that she has no help from the ex, he wants to step in and fix it.  However, Leda's not looking for someone to ‚Äúmagically‚Äù make things better, and it's not just because she's stubborn.  She's actually doing just fine, even if things are a bit harder than they should be, and she'd rather forget her ex even exists than allow him into her daughter's life.Their relationship starts out just as unconventional as the characters are, and without any contrived angst or unnecessary drama, they're a lot of fun.  Leda's constantly throwing out ridiculous phrases in an effort to keep her language clean around her daughter, and I think I was just as amused as Eric was by her approach to things.  Instead of the desperate, destitute, exhausted single mother one might expect, Leda finds joy in motherhood and making the best of what others would find an unfortunate situation.The romance is instant attraction coupled with a subtle build of trust, and Leda's insecurities get in the way for a while, but the wait is both entertaining and well worth it.  Their fun banter and often opposing headstrong ways makes for an interesting dynamic that makes their eventual romance seem more genuine that what I normally find in books.  All in all, The Cowboy Next Door, is a great read, with characters that defy the tired old standard and deliver the kind of happily ever after you can imagine happening in real life.***This review was originally written for The Romance Reviews.

"Trent and Reese fell in love on Rockwell Island and thought the world was theirs for the taking. Caught up in their faith in love and dreams of their future, they set off to New York, only to fall apart within just six months. It's been years, but Trent has never gotten over the woman he lost, and despite all the moving forward she's done, Reese's heart hasn't been able to move on. But now Trent's back, and in a place this small, there's no way they'll be able to avoid each other.The Verdict: Just buy it. Buy it now and read it and love it as much as I did. Reading this review is simply wasting time you could be spending with Trent and Reese and romance at its best. But if you must‚Ä¶Trent and Reese had a bit of a whirlwind romance, but they knew love when they found it, and marriage seemed like the perfect next step. They were young, and their adult lives were really just getting started. Trent was determined to succeed as an attorney in New York, and while Reese wasn't entirely comfortable leaving the island for the big city, she would have followed him anywhere. But six months of a strange new place, away from her home and with a husband who was more interested in his job than his wife, Reese threw in the towel and returned home. And they've both been hurting ever since.It was with the best of intentions that Trent pursued his career to the detriment of everything else. He thought he was proving that he could make his own way, that he was securing the perfect future for him and his bride, that their love could see them through anything ‚Äî even his never being around. And Reese was just lost, lost in a new city and lost without her husband's presence. Just six months later, she packed her bags, left a note, and returned home to Rockwell Island without him.Years have gone by, but the pain hasn't really diminished, and now Trent is back on Rockwell Island to take on the family business, a move that puts him in Reese's path almost immediately. The instant they run into each other, sparks fly, and their hearts break all over again. Trent's become the law world success he set out to be, but it's an empty achievement. And Reese has established herself as a local artist, but she, too, is still drowning in what could have been.It's impossible not to relate to them in some way. I think we all know what it's like to fall so fast, especially when we're young and convinced that happily ever after is just one white picket fence away. But too soon we're faced with the reality of adult life ‚Äî responsibilities and deadlines and differing ideas of just what constitutes happily ever after. It's so easy to lose sight of what's important, to take for granted that everything will always work out in the end, to assume that we're on the same page with our partner. But Trent and Reese, just like every other couple in history, soon learned differently, and their marriage didn't survive it.Their re-connection is bittersweet and feels incredibly real. There's an almost overwhelming sense of loss, even after so much time has passed, but for every bit of regret over the past, there is an equally strong and still very present love for each other. It doesn't take long for Trent to decide that he's going to prove himself worthy of another chance, and as much as Reese wants to protect her heart, she knows that Trent has had it all along. And within a matter of days, they're both in too deep, even without having decided to give each other another shot, to really stay away from each other. Not that their friends and family are surprised. What follows is a slow burn toward surrendering to feelings that haven't diminished and working through the things that tore them apart in the first place.Normally, this is where I'd get bored. Something about a divorced couple coming together again usually loses me, and I'm not really sure why. Perhaps it's because they know each other too well for it to feel new and exciting to me. Or maybe it's just that most books seem to rush that kind of reunion. But Melissa Foster and Bella Andre put this one together perfectly. I soaked up every scene, dwelled on every word, and died a little with every new bit of angst the characters suffered as they tried to reconcile the past and trust each other enough to seek a future together. Their story was beautifully sad but still hopeful, and even as I wanted them to just throw caution to the wind, I absolutely loved the way none of the characters' feelings were glossed over in favor of a rushed ending. Cape Cod Promises perfectly captures the frightening vulnerability and incredible love necessary to give happily ever after with someone a second try.***FicCentral received this book from Tasty Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ISY7UMCUZ7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986135844#wasThisHelpful","R23ISY7UMCUZ7O","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeking to better her lot in life, Shannon responds to an advertisement for a mail order bride and soon finds herself on the train to Texas.  Expecting to marry a rancher, she‚Äôs horrified to learn that her intended is a depraved brothel owner.  Refusing his offer of marriage seems like the only safe option, but he doesn‚Äôt take her rejection well, pulling a knife and leaving her bleeding in the street.  But before he can make good on his vile promises, a handsome cowboy steps in‚Ä¶But... As much as I enjoyed the story, there were a few not so great things that jumped out at me. First, there‚Äôs that apostrophe issue in the title, though that‚Äôs probably the fault of middle school English teachers.  I suppose it would be difficult to get students to understand punctuation that has become a permanent replacement for letters no longer used in our language, but they‚Äôre just perpetuating mistakes like this one.  The thing that nearly ran me off, though, was the synopsis.  Instead of piquing interest, it reads like the author (or whoever put it together) is trying to condense the whole story into a couple of paragraphs, much like my niece does when she‚Äôs rambling about a movie she saw.  It doesn‚Äôt reflect the story quality at all, and you have no idea how badly I want to rewrite it.  As for the story itself, it felt like there were some loose ends when all was said and done.  Did Hardy ever face any consequences for his ongoing deceit?  Did the townspeople ever truly get past their misconceptions?  It felt like everything on the ranch was resolved, while things outside their property were left completely up in the air.  But perhaps those ropes will be tied off in the coming books.(E.T.A. - Apparently the author was following the advice of a style guide that discards certain punctuation requirements and suggests that they are a matter of personal preference, so middle school English teachers are off the hook.  That style guide, however, should be burned.)Judging Covers: It was actually the cover that drew me in.  I‚Äôm a glutton for romances, especially anything with a cowboy/western theme, and huge bonus points if it‚Äôs historical.  But most of my searches for new reads in this particular genre come up empty, primarily because so many of the covers are just awful.  As much as I know it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the pages that really counts, it‚Äôs hard to get me to take a closer look when what‚Äôs on front is a weird paste job with modern hairstyles and bad fonts.  The cover for Cinders‚Äô Bride is truly one of the best I‚Äôve come across in a while ‚Äî a great modern layout for a story from another time.The Verdict: I think Cinders‚Äô Bride has ruined me for a while.  It‚Äôs been a long time since I found a historical western romance that I enjoyed this much, and as much as I want to tell everyone how great it is, I‚Äôm also itching to find more great reads in this genre now!Shannon‚Äôs life has been one long struggle, but it wasn‚Äôt without its bright moments.  Raised by parents who taught her the value of hard work, she‚Äôs been making her way on her own in the city, working in a factory since they passed away.  But the big city is no place for a young woman on her own, so she responds to an advertisement by a man seeking a bride.  But her dreams of making a family out West are dashed when she arrives in Texas to discover that her would-be husband is not the man he pretended to be.  Faced with a saloon and brothel owner instead of the rancher she came to meet, she refuses marriage, only to be viciously attacked, with no way back home and no one to turn to for help.Cinders never planned on marrying again, not after losing his first wife in childbirth.  But when he sees a scared and bleeding woman in town, he feels compelled to step up and help her.  Knowing that taking a single woman to stay at his ranch would incite cruel gossip and ruin her in the eyes of the town, he pays off her travel expenses, offers marriage, and soon returns to his ranch with his new, unexpected bride.Their relationship starts out much like you‚Äôd expect.  With a marriage in name only, Cinders goes about running his ranch as usual, and Shannon is determined to earn her keep and pay her debt.  Cinders hardly seems affected by the change, save for having to share the one bed in the house.  Shannon, however, feels like a burden, and her confidence is further lowered by the scar she‚Äôs sure to have once her stitches are healed.  Any chance at a real marriage is complicated by Cinders‚Äôs fear of losing another wife and Shannon‚Äôs insecurity about her appearance and place in his life.For all her meek ways, though, Shannon‚Äôs got a silently strong side.  She demands nothing, is considerate of everyone around her, and soon wins over not just the hardened cook at the ranch but Cinders himself.  She also knows what people think of her, that the man who falsely advertised for a bride has lied about her to everyone in town, and that even Cinders assumes her background includes work in a brothel.  At first, I really wanted her to stand up for herself, to insist that everyone know the truth and see with clarity that she was decent and virtuous, but then it dawned on me that it wouldn‚Äôt have really fit her character.  She‚Äôs more the type to prove her goodness through deeds than words.As hoped, Cinders begins to have feelings for Shannon, though it pains him to think about putting his heart on the line again.  And with the lack of any real communication between these two, forging ahead with a true marriage isn‚Äôt something easily done.  But danger, judgement, and a cattle drive all lead to some chivalrous and romantic moments that combine their fates.  It all adds up to an incredibly romantic story, pretty true to the time period, and perfect for readers who like to revisit times past.Cinders‚Äô Bride is everything I look for in a historical western romance, with classic characters who somehow defy cliches, a surprisingly complex plot, and a truly sweet love story.  My only real disappointment is that I have to find something else to read until the next book in the series is released.***FicCentral received this book from The Romance Reviews for free in exchange for an honest review.

"Widowed Kate is once again at the mercy of her father's match-making, and her prospects aren't very promising.  If only she could marry her father's steward, a gentle young man who seems smitten with her.Rafe has his sights on Kate as soon as he learns who she is.  Her father's sworn enemy, he's determined to marry her and reclaim the lands that were stolen from his family.  But Kate has feelings for another, and getting her out from under the watchful eye of her father isn't going to be easy.The Verdict:  While I enjoy historical romances, I especially like those that take place in some time other than the last couple hundred years, which is why I thought I'd give this one a shot.Like was common for women in her time, Kate is looked upon as property, someone to marry off to a good match as a favor, a way of advancing the family, or  means of gaining something.  Still young but newly widowed, she's back under her father's care, and there's not much care to be found in him.  He's not the least bit interested in her happiness; he simply wants to find her a husband that suits him, and so far it looks like he's about to make a terrible choice for her.Meanwhile, Kate is completely smitten with Warin, her father's steward.  He's good-looking, well-mannered, and kind to her, and while she knows that match will never happen, she fantasizes about the kind of romance all women want.  Rafe is determined to have her for himself, a means to getting her property back for his family, and while she's certainly intrigued by him, she's not entirely swayed.  She can't deny her rather passionate feelings for him, though.  What follows is drama, intrigue, and a bit of adventure as Kate learns that Rafe is really the only one invested in her happiness, and Rafe finds himself falling for her, despite his initial intentions.While some things were certainly romanticized (which is exactly why we read romances, right?), the story also felt accurate to the medieval time period.  Women were entirely at the whims of fathers, brothers, and husbands, and anyone with status was married off for profit and favor rather than love or happiness.  Kate's experience with her first marriage wasn't altogether horrible, but it wasn't about love, and from that marriage she learned that intimacy is an uncomfortable burden at best for women.  Of course, by the happily ever after, she learns differently.Since there's some intrigue and a swift twist in plot partway through, it's really impossible to say more about the story without giving everything away, but I will say that The Warrior's Wife has just about everything I look for in historical romances.  It's dramatic, fun, and certainly romantic, and it offers a heroine that, while true to the era, has a will of her own.  If you love your romance back in time, you won't want to put this one down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9POUQENAY5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496190548#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9POUQENAY5M","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At twenty years old, Jennifer's still a virgin, though not necessarily by choice or for lack of trying.  Determined to ditch that label by her twenty-first birthday, she's on the lookout for that special guy with whom to take the next step.  Add in one hot guy who is more than interested, crazy roommates, and Luke, the friend who's acting differently around her, and the next couple of months are going to be an emotional roller coaster.The Verdict:  Wow.  I picked up this book on a whim.  The college age girl trying to lose her virginity isn't exactly a new plotline, but it's generally a fun one, so I figured I would read this when I was all out of scheduled reviews and looking for something simple.  But V-Card is sooooooooooooo much better than I expected.Jennifer's not proud of her virgin status.  In fact, she only has that distinction thanks to a series of mishaps over the years.  At the same time, she's not looking to lose the label via a meaningless one-night stand, so really she's simply a college student who wants a real relationship that will lead to sex.  Completely understandable, right?  Then she meets Dain.Dain is a friend of a friend, and he really seems like the perfect guy.  He's sweet and kind and patient, and when he finds out she's a virgin, he doesn't push her.  He drops in when he misses her, brings her flowers for no reason at all, and spends time with her the way only the most perfect boyfriend will.  But while Dain is romancing Jennifer, her friend Luke is acting strange.  He makes no secret of his dislike for Dain, and something seems to be happening between him and Jennifer.  There's a new bit of heat between them that catches Jennifer off guard, but it's not something she's willing to explore, since she knows all about his player status.  After all, they live in the same house, so she sees just how often that revolving door to his bedroom welcomes a different girl.V-Card is surprisingly fun read, complete with all the usual college hijinks and drama, and a dose of harsh reality when least expected.  Jennifer is an easy character to love, since she's neither a wallflower nor a wild child, and I'm betting most women can relate to her simply wanting the happy relationship status she sees others having.  I have to say that twist in the plot really caught me off guard, too, just as it did Jennifer, and I think that says a lot about Alicia Michaels's writing.  Where most authors throw in such heavy hints that I just want to slap the heroine for not noticing the obvious, Michaels keeps readers in the moment, seeing things completely from the heroine's perspective, and it makes for a powerful story.  V-Card is fun, sweet, sad, and often hilarious, and it's definitely a must-read for any die-hard romance fan.  You can bet I'm grabbing the rest of this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FT840UYKPX2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC05ZEG#wasThisHelpful","R1FT840UYKPX2H","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovey's life seems to be a series of flighty half-decisions, and her latest has landed her at her famous hockey player brother's doorstep.  Leaving her boyfriend and job behind, she's ready to make something of herself in the big city, but now that she's seen her brother's roommate, she's looking to make a move on him as well.The Verdict: Lovey grew up in her big brother Duncan's shadow.  So while the family's entire life revolved around Duncan's eventual professional hockey career, Lovey was placated and spoiled by parents who didn't have enough time for her.  She's not really bitter about it, but it's clearly had an effect on who she's become as an adult.  As soon as her latest romance became too serious and her job too limiting, she split, showing up unexpectedly on Duncan's doorstep and expecting him to take her in until she can build a new life for herself.Honestly, this is where Lovey lost me a bit.  She's kind and warm-hearted, and she truly doesn't harbor any bad feelings toward her brother for always hogging everyone's attention.  But while she's busy trying to be her own person and prove she's not nearly as irresponsible as everyone thinks she is, she's pretty much the embodiment of being irresponsible.  In many ways, she acts like an immature teenager, refusing to set Duncan's mind at ease by telling him about the business she's starting and the potential she has for success.  She sees nothing wrong with mooching off of him for a while, even when he makes it clear that he doesn't really want her there, and she sometimes comes off a spoiled brat rather than a young woman striving for true independence.  However, she's young, trying to figure out who she is and what makes her happy, and in that sense, her immaturity is realistic.  Who among us hasn't been young and not so wise?Duncan's roommate Marc is another story, though, and he quickly won me over.  He's intelligent and thoughtful, and he's ridiculously attracted to Lovey.  However, he's also dedicated to his team and career, and the last thing he needs is for Duncan to lay him out for looking at his sister.  But their instant chemistry works against him, and as much as he tries to resist his feelings for her, she constantly tempts him, making keeping his distance impossible.  I'm not much for French accents, but I have no problem making an exception for Mark.  I wish we'd gotten a deeper look into his personality, but he definitely didn't fall flat.  Having just come out of a break-up and bearing plenty of responsibility for the team, he's got his hands full already.  But Lovey is the opposite he's attracted to, and aside from steaming up the place, they made for a great couple.Major Misconduct is the first book I've read by Kelly Jamieson, but I dare say it won't be my last.  It's a great start to the series, and it introduces some interesting characters whose own stories I wouldn't mind following.  If this kind of sweet, sexy, funny, and romantic is what we can expect, I can't wait to get my hands on the next book.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKFQ4J37M4VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWEMG5M#wasThisHelpful","R2FKFQ4J37M4VF","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cormac was intrigued by Emily the moment he first saw her, but he stayed out of sight for months, simply watching her from a distance.  Emily, running from a truly horrific past, isn't one to trust easily, but when Danny, the owner of a local gym, decides to take her under his wing, she finds herself under the protection of a whole team of fighters ‚Äî and giving up her heart to one in particular.The truth is that I wasn't at all prepared for Emily's backstory, and as soon as I figured out what it was, I put the book down.  It took me two more tries to get through it, not because the story wasn't interesting or the writing was bad, but because I just really didn't want to read about something so awful.  Emily's stepfather was an abusive monster, knocking her around constantly and forcing her to live in fear.  And just as I'd dreaded, it soon came out that he took that abuse exactly where it should never have gone ‚Äî all under the uncaring watch of her mother.  Getting past that enough that I could give the rest of the story a fair shot was no easy feat.Cormac is a hulk of a man, but his true strength is in the gentleness and patience with which he treats Emily.  Following Danny's cue, he looks out for her, takes care of her, and tries to make her happy.  Before long, the men at the gym are a family that she never had, and Cormac has stolen her heart.  Their romance is slow and sweet, and it seemed at first that it would end with a neat little happily ever after.  But that monster stepfather still had it out for her, and he made a grisly reappearance just when it seemed that everything was going great for her.While the beginning of their story piqued my interest, it was the end that really made the tale.  Faced with almost certain death and unwilling to lose anyone that she had come to love, Emily makes one hell of a sacrifice, establishing herself as a much stronger and more healed character than the one we first met.  While I may have had some issues with some of the subject matter, The Hurricane turned out to be quite the entertaining read, and the intense drama surprised me and kept me turning the pages as fast as I could.  Based on the quality of writing and the unique way in which the story unfolded, I have to say that I'll be keeping an eye out for the rest of this series.***FicCentral received this book from Grand Central Publishing (via Net Galley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3H5N8XUJPLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPQH18#wasThisHelpful","R2D3H5N8XUJPLA","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Loving You is Easy, I didn't hesitate to grab this next book, but what's funny is I didn't even realize they were part of the same series until I sat down to read it.  As in the previous book, Neve and Rory ‚Äúmeet‚Äù through a pen-pal program while he's deployed, and their friendly letters quickly take a turn for steamy.  But things don't go quite as planned when he's home on leave, and he's left with a lot of explaining to do.The chemistry between these two is off the charts, so it kind of makes sense that they find themselves getting hot and heavy in a storeroom in the back of his family's pub.  However, their tryst ends on an ugly note when a woman claiming to be Rory's fiance catches them together, and Neve is completely mortified by the whole situation.  Not only did she get it on with him in a smelly old closet, but it looks like he's been lying to her all along.Fortunately, there's a reasonable explanation for the whole mess, though Neve doesn't make it easy on Rory.  He heads back off to war for a few more months while she stews in the aftermath of her ‚Äúmistake,‚Äù but once he's home for good, Rory wastes no time in trying to clear things up.  Neve's situation by that point isn't ideal, as she's suffering from an infection after donating bone marrow, and she has little choice but to accept Rory's help, much as she'd like to keep pushing him away.The path of their relationship is intriguing, starting off too strong, falling apart, and then slowly building back up as they really get to know each other.  Neve's got plenty of issues due to some reckless behavior and bad decisions in the past, and it colors her view of any future for herself.  On the straight and narrow now, she's determined to take her dance career straight into Cirque du Soleil, but ugly pieces of her past keep showing up and breaking down her self-respect.Rory, for being such a great guy, also has plenty going on with his PTSD, but he's falling for Neve wholeheartedly, and the idea of her leaving to follow her dreams is the worst kind of quandary for him.  He doesn't want to get in the way of her career, but he wants her to choose him.  The real issue, though, is simply Neve's view of herself.Like the book before it, All I Need is You was nothing like I expected, but the very flawed characters and totally human screw-ups were what made it so great.  Neve's past isn't pretty, but it's also not unheard of.  And Rory can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth, even when all he wants to do is be the man Neve needs.  I also loved that he's not exactly tall, dark, and handsome at 5'4‚Ä≥, though he's definitely got the alpha & hot thing down.  This is one series that turns the usual romance trope completely on end in the best possible way.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCJPG3XSK8H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7NW#wasThisHelpful","R1TCJPG3XSK8H1","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Mason's eccentric aunt bequeaths the family ranch to him and his brothers, it's not without some rather unorthodox conditions.  Not only do all the brothers have to marry, but at least one must have a child within a year.  Spread out among the branches of the Armed Forces, none are really ready, especially to do so in such a rush, so Mason places an online ad for them all.  Regan's answer is not at at all what Mason expects, but he's immediately intrigued and sets out to convince her that a life with him just might be what she needs.But...  That title‚Ä¶ I have to say that I probably saw this book a hundred times on different freebie lists, and I rolled my eyes at the title and just kept going.  Is it supposed to be kitschy?  I just figured it was some ridiculous drivel I would never want to read.  But then months later I realized Cora Seton is a pretty popular author, and if there was ever a time to try reading a new (to me) author's work, it's when you can download the book from a retailer for free.  I'm still kind of embarrassed to post this title on my site, though.  It just doesn't get cheesier than this.The Verdict:  Reagan won me over the second she replied to Masons wife-wanted ad.  Ready to move forward with her life, despite the lack of husband or even somewhat significant romantic relationship, Regan's already made her appointment to be artificially inseminated and become a single mother.  Sure, she'd prefer to have a husband by her side, but without any prospects on the horizon, she knows it's up to her.  She doesn't immediately fall for the ‚Äúwife wanted‚Äù ad she sees and really can't imagine the kind of woman it takes to agree to that kind of arrangement, but it's a nice fantasy.  Lots of alcohol later, though, she ends up sending a ridiculous reply, immediately capturing the attention of one very hot Navy SEAL.Mason is a good guy, but rushing into marriage with a virtual stranger was not in his plans.  However, he does want the family ranch back, and he can get it if he and his brothers all marry.  They're not thrilled about the conditions either, but they're willing to do their part if it means getting back the house and land they love.  Mason, though, is the only one nearing the end of his service, so it's up to him to get the ball rolling and fulfill the second part of his crazy aunt's conditions ‚Äî having a child.Regan's response to Mason's ad was nothing short of hilarious.  With the absurd list of qualifications she includes, the mention of wanting to lick him, and the photograph of just her foot, she was bound to stand out.  She just didn't expect it would stand out all the way to the delete button.  But Mason can't help but appreciate her wit, and they soon strike up an online relationship of sorts.  Granted, she insists they can simply be friends, but now that he knows more about her, he's all about convincing her to give him a chance.  Finally, she agrees to go with him to check out the ranch.Mason hopes the house and land will impress her enough that she'll see they can have a good life together, but what he finds is not what he expected.  It seems the uncle who's had the property has pretty much let it fall apart, sold off just about everything of value, and left him with a money pit.  To make matters worse, he ran up some debts locally, striking down the chance that Mason might get any of their neighbors to help him get the ranch and house back into shape.Again, though, Regan is not what Mason expected.  Having now developed a solid friendship with Mason, along with a healthy level of attraction, Regan sees what Mason has to accomplish and wants to help him.  She's not quite sold on forever yet, but there's no reason she can't see him through the challenge he now faces.  Before long, they're working side by side, and while Regan's never lived the country life, she throws herself fully into every task, winning even more of Mason's respect.  Their situation is certainly odd, but the more time they spend together, the more it becomes clear that they belong together.  Regan's plans to have a baby fall in nicely with Mason's plans, though he plans on doing it the old fashioned way.  But with the disrepair of the house and ranch, along with the gigantic obstacle of Mason's pride and sense of duty, they're facing an uphill battle.The Navy SEAL's E-mail Order Bride is a lot more fun than I expected, and I loved Regan from page one.  Unlike other romances in which marriages are arranged, this story doesn't have that one person doing it out of desperation.  Mason's being given a big shove, sure, but he's not looking to marry someone he has no interest in, and of course, Regan has every chance to back out if she wants to.  The marriage of convenience plot line may be pretty typical, but the way these two take the time to know and then fall for each other makes it a great read. I just might have to grab the rest of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UL4T3MSW874/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q92RXJO#wasThisHelpful","R32UL4T3MSW874","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rory Kavanagh's career fell apart when his leg was severely injured in a bout, and he's been drifting through life ever since.  While his family is there to support him in any way he needs, and a new career as a trainer is guaranteed, he can't seem to cope with the changes.  Alcohol and pain meds are his only constant, but then a plucky little waitress catches his eye.Clare's past isn't pretty, but she's doing her best to start over.  Between the abuse of her ex and the criminal activity in which she landed, a clean break is just what the doctor ordered, and setting up house in Brooklyn, where no one can judge her, seems to be the right step.  The last thing she needs is a man to complicate things, especially a man whose very identity is tied up in violence ‚Äî sanctioned though it may be in the MMA world.  But she can't seem to get Rory off her mind.But... I have to say I'm not convinced.  While I did enjoy the story, and I imagine the full cast of characters will be lots of fun as the series continues, some realism was missing.  For one, Rory went cold turkey and ditched the booze and pills, and yet he never showed any real signs of withdrawal.  Sure, some addictions are more psychological than anything, but the substances he was abusing for quite some time don't fall into that gray area.  Narcotics and alcohol are physically addictive, and at the rate he was downing them, there's no way his body wouldn't have been screaming for more.Likewise, Clare seemed to have little issue with falling into a relationship with Rory.  Someone who had been abused and taken advantage of would generally have been more skittish about picking up with another man, especially one who clearly had some issues and was known for beating the hell out of people.  While she was a strong character and certainly able to bounce back from her past, it was too instantaneous to be believed.The Verdict:  Despite the pretty brush that painted over any real problems these two had, Breaking a Legend was a really fun read.  The banter between Clare and Rory was awesome, as were all the witticisms that flew when he came in range of his large family.  I don't think there's a single character I didn't like, except for Clare's jerk of a boss, but clearly we weren't supposed to like him.The chemistry between these two was just sizzling, as one would hope when picking up an MMA romance.  It made the quick pace of their relationship a bit more understandable and also brought out the more sensitive side of Rory ‚Äî even as he tried to keep his man card up.  Of course, there was the psycho ex to deal with, not to mention all the feminine eyes tracking Rory, but while it followed a somewhat standard romance pattern, it didn't venture into annoying clich√© territory.All in all, Breaking a Legend is a fun, hot start to what's sure to be an incredibly entertaining series, and after falling in love with pretty much everyone in the book, I can't wait to see whose story we get next.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPF8QZV8VGF5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VD043F4#wasThisHelpful","RPF8QZV8VGF5I","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gavin King was at the top of his game, but one bad injury may have just ended his career.  His team isn't even willing to give him a chance to recover, and he suddenly finds himself traded to the Sonics.  Leaving behind the bright lights of L.A., he's now stuck in New Jersey, playing for a second rate team, and even his model girlfriend has moved on without him.  The one bright spot in all the gloom is Jessica, the physical therapist assigned to get him back in playing shape again.But... For the most part, I loved this book, but there was one thing about it that was worse than nails on a chalkboard.  Jessica has a male friend who is gay.  That in and of itself is fine, and I can even deal with him being some kind of fashion diva, given that I've known a few myself who have fit that particular stereotype.  But I almost ditched the book partway through when Jessica repeatedly referred to him as ‚Äúgirlfriend.‚Äù  Not ‚Äúhe's one of my girlfriends,‚Äù like he's just one of the girls, but ‚ÄúGirlfriend knew what he was doing,‚Äù and crap like that.  Over and over again.  It went from being a stereotype to a ridiculous caricature, and while I'm sure I was supposed to read those scenes and appreciate how close these two were, it pretty much ruined that aspect of the story for me.The Verdict:  Jessica has always been one of the guys.  She does have a feminine side, but growing up with four brothers left it little room to develop.  Now a physical therapist working for the Sonics, she's completely in her element, dealing with professional athletes and using her sports and psychology knowledge to build a strong career.  But after a romance gone completely wrong, she knows better than to get involved with a ball player.Gavin had everything going for him and then had it all taken away.  Pushed relentlessly by his father to be a sports star, he lived the high life in L.A. and had the arm candy girlfriend to prove it.  But one injury has changed everything, and while he hates having been traded to a team in New Jersey of all places, he knows it's his one chance to prove he's worth something to the sport.I really loved the relationship between Gavin and Jessica, right from the moment they met.  He was certainly attracted to her, and she couldn't deny to herself how good looking he was, but there was no rush to satisfy that lust.  He wasn't over the woman who dumped him, and she wasn't about to make the same mistake twice.  But once he settled in, accepted his new life, and saw past Jessica's defenses, he wanted nothing more than to carve out a future with her.Gavin really surprised me, not that he was a nice guy, but rather the way he proved it in just about everything he did.  His ex-girlfriend was some famous model, which certainly fit the lifestyle he once had, but when she dumped him, he was honestly hurt.  It wasn't just a case of his pride being wounded or needing to have some hot young thing on his arm.  He was, of course, attracted to Jessica at first sight, but he wasn't over his ex just yet, and he didn't go all conceited and immediately put the moves on her.  Even his acceptance of the much less glamorous life he now had in Jersey showed just what a good person he was.  Sure, he was disappointed, but he wasn't looking a gift horse in the mouth.As for Jessica, normally it annoys the hell out of me when someone disregards an entire cross section of people based on the actions of just one.  However, in this case, it kind of made sense to me.  She'd gone all head over heels for a guy who thought nothing of hooking up with groupies on the road, and it had really done a number on her self-esteem.  Given that she was surrounded by men who had the same temptations, I couldn't blame her for deciding not to risk her heart on any of them.  But Gavin was too sincere in his feelings for her to let her dismiss him so easily, and the patient and understanding way in which he worked to win her over made for a wonderful story.Sports romances tend to follow a pattern, and The Heat of the Moment did so in the best way.  With some standard plot points and scenarios, Katie Rose managed to write something fresh and entertaining, and while I figured I would enjoy it, I didn't have a clue just how much!  Jessica was easy to relate to, Gavin was just incredible, and their story didn't really take the overused turns I expected.  The Heat of the Moment is a standout romance for sports fans and anyone who loves a man in a team uniform.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUCWYZ7DZBDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKWAJSO#wasThisHelpful","R1RUCWYZ7DZBDV","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little charger is kind of amazing.  Most importantly, it holds quite a bit of charge, and it had no problem quickly charging up my nearly dead iPhone to 100% while I was still using it to play games and basically waste tons of power -- with plenty left to spare for charging more devices.  I honestly expected that it would be very slow to charge up a device and maybe not have much juice behind it, so it certainly exceeded my expectations.It comes with a super-short USB to Micro USB cord, which does the job, but you'll probably want to use your own longer cord if you're trying to charge a device while using it.  And of course, if you've got an Apple device, you'll need their special little lightning cord.  It's small enough that I can toss it in my purse and know that I've got power whenever and wherever I may need it, and while aesthetics aren't really a priority here, it's a cute little thing.  I do wish, however, that it came with some sort of case or bag.  It's clearly designed to be portable, which means it's probably going to get banged around a bit, tossed into the bottom of a purse, or buried in a backpack by most users.  Just a simple plastic case or bag would go a long way to keeping it clean and useful.  I've tossed mine in one of those thicker, small, zip-lock bags that some other product was packed in, and that seems to keep it safe from whatever dusty mess is lurking at the bottom of my purse.*I received a significant discount on this product from the seller in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DU5W7Z2ZKOZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU3XWC8#wasThisHelpful","R1DU5W7Z2ZKOZT","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use RFID access cards at work, so the first thing I did when I received the wallet was throw my card in there and see if I could get back in the building.  I have to admit that I was skeptical, since I've seen lots of articles and even demos in the news that showed many wallets and sleeves purported to block RFID actually fail to do so.  I don't actually have any credit cards with the chips in them, but I did need a slim case for cards, and this seemed like the perfect excuse to try one out.  And guess what... It works!  When my access card is closed up in the wallet, the card reader just stares at me with it's evil red light and won't let me come in, no matter how close I'm holding it or for how long.  But the second I open the case, the reader is able to pick up my card and pop the door open.  Color me impressed!However, I do have to knock it down one star for design.  While the wallet is sleek and shiny, the little divider sleeves inside are a pretty tight fit.  Most actual wallets allow you to slide a card or three into each slot, but the rigid accordioned sleeve in this case seems to be designed to the exact size of a credit card.  That means my access card, which is slightly thicker than a credit card, didn't slide in easily and just barely fit.  This shouldn't be a problem for anyone who only has 6 or fewer cards with RFID chips in them, but with so many payment cards, access cards, and other IDs now using chips, anyone with a fuller wallet is going to need something bigger.  Still, the wallet does exactly what it claims to do, which is block RFID signals on your cards from being scanned by those who shouldn't have the info, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone with that concern.Oh yeah, and because I'm ridiculously cheap, I received a significant discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZM68KWO1J41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOZ4JOQ#wasThisHelpful","R31ZM68KWO1J41","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am really impressed!  I just got my first iPhone -- the awesomely pink 6S -- and my big fear was the broken screen that nearly everyone I know has.  A techie family member told me to immediately buy a case and tempered glass screen cover by Spigen, so I headed straight to Amazon.First, it comes with a wet wipe and a dry wipe, as well as a dust remover to get your screen spotless before applying the cover.  I'm used to the old ""clean your screen thoroughly"" without any materials with which to do so, so this package was a welcome surprise.  The glass itself is perfectly fitted to the phone and ridiculously easy to apply right the first time.  I just set the phone down on the table, peeled the plastic off the adhesive side of the cover, and held onto the little ""wings"" while lining the cover over my screen.  I ended up with one tiny bubble to remove, which took about two swipes with my finger, and then it was perfect. Not a thing changed about the responsiveness of the screen to my touch, either.What really sold me, though, is how well it does its job.  I threw it into the purse from hell and carted it around with me to run errands.  Digging through my purse for keys, wallet, and whatever else I needed didn't leave a single mark on the phone as it got tumbled around.  In the past, I bought multi-packs of screen protectors, since I knew it was only a matter of days, if not just hours, before they were all scuffed up, peeled off somewhere in my purse, or dotted with bubbles and dust under the edges. My Spigen screen protector ran the gauntlet and came out looking brand new.*I received a significant discount on this product from the seller in exchange for an honest review. And honestly?

"Charlie Ryan is a city girl through and through.  Raised in New York City, she‚Äôs used to life moving fast and easy access to the finer things.  But when she catches her fiance with his secretary, starting over sounds like a great plan.  And the timing couldn‚Äôt be better, since she‚Äôs just inherited a ranch in Montana from a grandmother she never knew.But... There‚Äôs not really anything about the story I didn‚Äôt like, but there were some periods of time that were glossed over, and in skipping past so much day-to-day life, I felt like I missed out on a few things.  Take Cherry, for example.  She seems cool enough, and it‚Äôs clear she would make an awesome friend, but after a run-in or two, we‚Äôre told that she and Charlie have shared enough chips and margaritas over the summer to become close.  I understand the need to get on with the story, but that‚Äôs one bit I think should have been shown instead of told.  As much as I liked her character, I didn‚Äôt feel like I got to know Cherry well enough to instantly get her suddenly solid friendship with Charlie.The Verdict: Tucked Away starts out with a hilarious bang ‚Äî an ornery bull attacking the car in which he‚Äôs trapped city girl Charlie.  She‚Äôs hot and tired and ready to check out her new home, but she‚Äôs stuck biding her time until a hot cowboy comes to the rescue.  That bit of levity set the tone, and while there were definitely some serious moments, this book was loads of fun.Charlie is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to ranching and small town life, but she‚Äôs not averse to giving it all a shot.  Screwed over by a philandering fiance, she‚Äôs ready for some big changes.  Of course, she doesn‚Äôt quite know what she‚Äôs in for, but the little country house quickly feels like home, and she finds the slower pace and simpler lifestyle more to her liking than she would have expected.  Fortunately, the ranch comes complete with ranch hands, so she‚Äôs not completely on her own in figuring everything out, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt that the local veterinarian is pretty easy on the eyes.  In no time, Charlie‚Äôs made some new friends ‚Äî the guys that work the ranch, sexy vet Zack, the owner of the local diner, and the sweetest thirteen-year-old country girl you‚Äôve ever seen.Zack‚Äôs been burned before, and while he‚Äôs no saint, his heart has been locked up tight since the day his ex-wife abandoned him and their baby girl.  He‚Äôs spent the years putting his daughter first and taking care of the town‚Äôs many animals.  He‚Äôs intrigued by and attracted to Charlie, but he knows better than to get wrapped up in a woman who won‚Äôt be satisfied outside the neon lights of the city, and he‚Äôs practically counting down the days until she gives up and takes off.In most books that center around someone diving headfirst into an unfamiliar lifestyle, there‚Äôs something about the character that never quite sits right with me, but not so with Charlie.  Despite everything she‚Äôd recently been through, her seemingly unfeeling mother, and having no clue who her father was, she took on every new challenge with determination and hope ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have to morph into a whole new person to achieve it.  In spite of (or perhaps because of) her own abandonment issues, she didn‚Äôt hesitate to open her arms to Sophie, the young teenage girl who was desperate for some female company, and while her inexperience showed, her heart was too good not to see a little of herself in Sophie‚Äôs loneliness.Zack‚Äôs initial dismissal of Charlie as someone who would turn tail and run from the often dirty realities of ranching quickly had me judging him ‚Äî a bit too quickly as it turns out.  He knew she was out of her element and couldn‚Äôt imagine her sticking around in the long run, but he also didn‚Äôt deny or try to brush off her little victories.  It felt like, for all his wanting to guard his heart, he was inadvertently opening it more to her as each day progressed.  In the end, it was clear that Zack was an awesome blend of romantic and rustic, and if his inherent goodness hadn‚Äôt won me over, his love for her daughter certainly would have.What really did it for me, though, was the somewhat silly (but altogether realistic) approach to country living.  From picking out hot pink cowboy boots to naming a newly born calf Rodney, Charlie totally made sense to me.  And that‚Äôs pretty big, considering I‚Äôm more comfortable in a pole barn than a shopping mall.  I honestly expected her to take longer to win me over or to annoy me for a little while in how she viewed things.  But  the way she embraced every new experience on the ranch, her sense of adventure and her genuinely accepting personality‚Ä¶ How could I not love her?But while Tucked Away is most certainly a romance, it‚Äôs also very much about family and healing the past.  As I mentioned, Charlie‚Äôs mom is a far cry from sympathetic and understanding, and there‚Äôs a divide between them that needs mending.  Charlie‚Äôs lack of any knowledge of her father is a big challenge for her as well, not to mention the previously unknown grandmother who left her the ranch in the first place.  Building a new life for herself is only one part of the entertaining puzzle that Tucked Away serves up, with plenty of room left for Charlie‚Äôs learning more about who she is and where she came from while Zack works at letting himself fall in love again.I could probably go on and on about this book ‚Äî it‚Äôs certainly one of the more interesting and developed stories I‚Äôve read ‚Äî but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be much more fun if you just read it yourself.  Tucked Away is genuine country romance at its best, with complex and loveable characters, some mystery and drama, and lots of laughs, and I have no doubt the rest of this series is going on my must preorder! list.***FicCentral received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

"Since cheating almost certain death as a child, Memory has been doing nothing but living every moment and getting everything she can out of life.  Refusing to be seen as anything but the girl she is now, she's kept the illness of her past a secret from everyone and instead become the life of every party.  But when the cancer returns, she's not ready to fight it, not ready to let go of the life she's embraced and deal with the treatments and sickness and looks of pity.  And she's certainly not ready to fall in love with a man who makes her want every bit of a future that isn't guaranteed.But... The editing, or lack thereof, hasn't improved with book three.  Most noticeably, the author or editor or proofreader or whoever is responsible has no access to spellcheck, any English dictionary published after the early 1600s, or Google.  That's really the only logical explanation for the continued use kookoo ‚Äî which isn't even a word!!! ‚Äìrather than the actual word of cuckoo.  It's a common bird named for the sound it makes, and for the past 97 years, it's been American slang word for crazy. Which is kind of how I feel having had to read past it again.Judging Covers: The cover's certainly pretty, and it probably would have caught my eye anyway, but I can't quite figure it out.  I think I was expecting something more in line with the covers of the previous books.  Why'd it go from people in fields (totally Texas) to some girl underwater?The Verdict: While Stupid Love gives us more glimpses at the couples we fell in love with in the previous books, this story is a bit of a departure from what I assumed was the norm for this series.  Whereas the previous stories revolved heavily around college life, Jace and Memory's journey seems to use college as an accessory, not a major setting or part of the plot.Memory is the girl who beat the odds, surviving a type of cancer that spares few, and ever since then, she's been all about living life to the fullest.  She's the daredevil, the one who always speaks her mind, the girl who finds joy in every breath and brings excitement to everything she does.  But no one knows about her past battles, and she prefers to keep it that way, not wanting anyone to look at her with pity or treat her differently.  And that's especially true now that the cancer is back.Jace does his best to resist his attraction to the girl he assumes is like every other girl on campus.  He first sees her when she's ready to puke up her guts at a party, and the next time he sees her, she turns the flirt on full blast.  As far as he's concerned, there's nothing special about her at all.  But then they keep running into each other, and he sees more and more about her that's beyond intriguing.  Before he knows it, he can't get her out of his head, and despite his reservations, he's falling hard.The major conflict of the story isn't silly campus hijinks or the usual college student drama, and it's not some past trauma coming back to ; it's Memory's avoidance of the truth of her illness, the tumor growing in her brain that she's terrified of giving into, and the surgery and treatment she doesn't want because it might be more devastating than death.  But falling in love with Jace was not in her plans, and the aggressive cancer is catching up to her, forcing her to face her fears and her love and everyone she's kept it secret from.While the logical part of me wanted to slap Memory silly and force her into telling everyone the truth, scheduling the surgery, and dealing with the awful reality of her situation, it was impossible not to understand her denial.  Inside her chaotic mind, it seemed that even the simple act of admitting she was in danger was giving up on the life she tried so hard to achieve, and one can hardly blame her for trying to reach her goals despite the odds against her.  Fortunately, this is romantic fiction, so despite the pretty terrifying circumstances Memory faced, things all worked out in the end.  Stupid Love is an emotional look at the choices one makes when faced with the possibility of no future at all, and the profound impact falling in love can have on facing our worst fears.***FicCentral received this book from TKA Distribution (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XWL4AOT3TNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119RARDM#wasThisHelpful","R27XWL4AOT3TNH","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Branna learned long ago not to form emotional attachments, so after three years of high school in Lake Howling, she took off for college and never looked back.  In the years since, Branna has stayed in touch with only one person, a kindly old neighbor who provided the only real support and stability that Branna ever knew.  But now Georgie's passed away, leaving Branna her house and beloved vintage Mustang, and Branna finds herself returning to the town she never intended to see again.Jake was the boy everyone wanted to be back in high school.  Fun, popular, and surrounded by friends, it seemed almost guaranteed that the future was his to take.  But war has a way of changing people, and after a traumatic stint in combat, he's ditched his medical license for odd jobs as a mechanic and spends his nights fighting his way out of the battles in his mind. Lake Howling is the town that raised him and believed in him, but the golden boy he once was is long since dead.But... Why doesn't Branna, supposedly once a college-level English professor, have enough knowledge of the language to school Mikey on the proper use of ain't rather than incorrectly tell him it's not a word?  I might not have expected her to know which century saw it change spelling from an't to ain't, but I can't imagine the advanced degree necessary to teach English at that level would have neglected any study of the language's rather recent history.  With that limited knowledge, I could have believed she was a third-grade teacher, but I'm not sold on her being a professor of English.The Verdict:  A Promise of Home wasn't exactly what I expected, and that's a very good thing.  Unlike most stories in which the central pair are reunited after brief adolescent relationships, pointless feuds, or secret crushes on each other, Branna and Jake have a different connection.  Distant and detached in high school, Branna never really responded to Jake's few attempts at friendship, and Jake never really gave it much thought.  But now that life has kicked him around a bit as well, he's just as wounded by the past as she is, and their issues are what lead to their better understanding each other.Their small town plays almost as big of a character in the story as Branna and Jake do, and it's pretty authentic.  It does include the requisite town grapevine, inability to remain invisible, and tendency of the locals to get into each other's business.  However, it avoids becoming the ridiculous cliche I find in most books set in such a place, and it made each scene less predictable and more interesting.  As it turns out, Branna's disconnection from the town is mostly in her own mind, and soon enough she begins to feel that she's not only accepted but welcomed.  And as much as Jake wishes he could just fade away into the background, the town cares about him too much to let him destroy himself.Most interesting, though, is the dynamic between them.  While they don't loathe each other, they really have no interest in each other at first.  Sure, they each notice how attractive the other is, but they have no intentions of acting upon it.  Fortunately, happenstance keeps placing them in each other's way, despite their best efforts to keep their guards up, and both Branna and Jake seem to subconsciously recognize a fellow wounded soul.  Watching them begin to accept that something more is growing between them was half the fun!It's difficult to describe what makes this romance so different from the others I read without giving away some refreshingly surprising turns in the story.  It's not the plot or the characters or the dialogue‚Ä¶ I think it's just something in Wendy Vella's writing that stands out.  The story is serious and emotional without being overly angsty, the characters' interactions are both funny and moving, and the pace is quick without ever feeling rushed.  There's an authenticity in their actions and words, not to mention the presence of everyone else in town, that really struck me, and even as I grew frustrated with Branna and Jake's issues putting their pasts behind them, I found myself agreeing that their experiences justified their shared reluctance to take a new risk.  A Promise of Home is certainly a pleasant surprise in an otherwise cookie-cutter genre.***FicCentral received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

"Mikayla had everything.  A fun best friend, the perfect boyfriend, and an amazing family filled out her life leading up to graduation.  But on what should have been a blissfully romantic prom night, everything is taken from her in just a few short hours.  Now she's starting over from nothing with the help of a boy she's just met and a future that's no longer clearly mapped out.The Verdict:  With the hilarious introduction of Kayla's family in the first few pages, I was immediately hooked.  And as the drama of prom night played out, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  The discovery at the restaurant was a romance novel cliche, but Jake added a fresh dimension things with his efforts to distract, and his friends were impossible not to love. However, as the story moved past that night, I began to get a little frustrated with a few things.  Instalove, lack of some development, and endless overreactions didn't stop me from wanting to read it, but they were enough to dim my enjoyment a bit.Jake is a great guy, no doubt.  But within just a few days, he was internally declaring his love for Kayla, and she was way too fast with the ‚Äúhe's my home now,‚Äù statement.  Sure, teenagers tend to fall hard and fast, but they barely knew each other, and she was still reeling from tragedy.  Call it rebounding or forming a dependency or whatever, but it didn't feel as genuine as it would have if they'd established a better friendship before diving in.  And then there were the knee-jerk reactions‚Ä¶It seemed that every time something completely innocent could be misinterpreted, it was.  When Jake saw Kayla laughing with one of his best friends?  Jealous rage.  When Kayla saw any female over the age of 13 talking to Jake?  Hissy fit.  Over and over again.  I suppose this could have been the product of their having rushed into a relationship without a solid foundation first, or perhaps it's simply because they were both high school seniors who can't be expected to act with reason and logic all the time, but whatever it was, it got kind of old.  There was a serious lack of trust between these two for way too long.And finally, there's Kayla's reaction to the deaths on prom night.  Yes, she immediately freaked out, as anyone with even one cardiac cell would do. But after that, there was almost no reaction.  Why wasn't she asking why?  Why didn't she wonder who was behind it, what they were after, why they had to take things so far?  Where were the wonderings about their final moments or if she had anything to worry about?  While it was made clear that she was devastated, the focus swiftly changed to her budding relationship, with little realistic continuing grief.  It's not that she was necessarily two-dimensional; it just felt like all the turmoil she should have voiced or at least kept in her thoughts was edited out.Despite those issues, the characters and story were interesting enough that I can honestly say I liked it.  The initial drama was incredibly heavy, and watching Kayla navigate back to solid ground was pretty rewarding.  Jake was just incredible most of the time, and even when I wanted to slap them both silly, I was rooting for them.  I might have been a little irritated with the characters, but I've read some of Jay McLean's more recent work, and it's nothing short of brilliant.  And I have to admit that I really want to see Logan fall in love, and I might have a fit if I don't get his story, so I think I just might continue with this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N20VBLXFJUR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU5EJR4#wasThisHelpful","R2N20VBLXFJUR8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main reason I jumped at the chance to read and review My Lady Faye was because the previous book, Sweet Bea, was so much fun and quite a bit different from your typical historical romance.  So, of course, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.  However, Faye's story is a good deal more serious ‚Äî and at times darker ‚Äî than what I was really expecting.  I'm certainly not saying it was a bad read, just not exactly what I expected.After taking her children and fleeing her brute of a husband, Lady Faye has been safe at her father's home.  The years of abuse she suffered under Lord Calder can't be undone, but she's finding herself again and enjoying being a mother without having to fear for the safety of her children or herself.Gregory was Lady Faye's friend and confidant when she was suffering at the whims of her husband, but now that he's seen her safely home, he's returned to his chosen path of seeking priesthood.  But his time at the monastery hasn't erased Faye from his mind or heart, and when he's asked to save her young son, whom Calder has abducted, he can't say no.Faye insists on going with Gregory, and no amount of insistence can persuade her differently.  It's on her journey with him that she finds herself trying to resist her feelings for him, that one-time dream that he would be not only her friend and savior but her husband.  Gregory's having the same issues, and the close proximity in which he finds himself with her doesn't help matters.Their relationship made sense from the get-go, since Gregory knew her almost better than anyone, and he'd certainly witnessed the brutality she suffered for so many years.  He'd been a friend to her the entire time, and as much as he wanted to devote his life to God, Faye always had his heart.  While much of the innocence and humor of the first book in the series was absent in this one, My Lady Faye was more of a dramatic and emotional journey, with Gregory having to decide between his calling and his love, and Faye unable to deny her feelings for Gregory, even as the safety of her child was her first priority.  Their time together wasn't really a development or rekindling of a relationship, but a realization of the one they both wanted with each other.My Lady Faye couldn't best the awesomeness that was Sweet Bea, but it was certainly a solid and enjoyable read, and as seems to be the key to this series, quite a departure from your standard, overdone historical romance.  The Sir Arthur's Legacy series is an entertaining journey back in time for the more modern-minded romance fan.***FicCentral received this book from Kensington Books (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9AF7XN1QX00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QP3CZRC#wasThisHelpful","RE9AF7XN1QX00","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I've been having so much fun with Lori Foster's Ultimate series, I thought it was time I checked out some more of her books.  And we all know how much I love romance countrified.  Even better, this one was on Overdrive at my local library and is two books in one, so there was no way I was going to pass it up!The first story is Sawyer's.  The town doctor and one of several brothers who live together in their late parents' old farmhouse, Sawyer's a single dad of a teenage son, and while he certainly isn't hurting for female attention, he's not exactly looking for a wife.  But then Honey Malone crashes through his freshly mended fence, lands her car in the water, and refuses to go to a hospital.  Before she knows it, she finds herself a guest in Sawyer's house, drowning in testosterone, and trying to trying to stay one step ahead of whoever's been trying to kill her.I absolutely loved the backstory of Sawyer and his son, and I'm pretty sure I was in love with the book as soon as their lack of blood relationship was revealed.  But even better was the camaraderie of the brothers, the way they egged each other on and behaved exactly as you would expect from a house full of men.  The way they took control of Honey's problems would have been annoying as hell ‚Äî had they not all been so damned charming and sexy!Honey's story is rather complicated, and she's just as in the dark about what's happening as we are.  She knows that someone is after her, but for the life of her, she can't imagine why.  All she's certain of is that they're dangerous, she has to stay under the radar, and she can't drag these men into the danger she faces.  But they're far too chivalrous and protective to let her go it alone, and once they have some idea of what she's up against, they're determined to see her safely through it ‚Äî especially Sawyer.The romance between these two was sweetly steamy, if that makes sense.  There were certainly some bedroom scenes, but they weren't as graphic as I'm used to reading, and I'm not sure if that has more to do with the age of the series or the character of the brothers featured.  Either way, it was kind of a nice change from all the stories out there constantly trying to push the envelope by spicing things up just a little too far.  Sawyer was certainly all alpha, but he was also a gentleman, and while I wouldn't recommend this book to young teens, I think it's a nice, middle-of-the-road approach to writing sex scenes.The second story in the book is Morgan's.  He's all scowl and suspicion in Sawyer's story, though he's not incapable of some comic relief, as was made clear by his walking into the kitchen in the buff when Honey was trying to make her escape.  But now that he's met her sister Misty, it's his turn to find romance he wasn't necessarily looking for.Morgan knows the last thing he needs is to have a fling with his brother's sister-in-law, but Misty knocks him on his ass from day one.  He tries his damnedest to avoid his attraction to her, with the end result looking like he can't even stand her.  And then, of course, it drives him nuts that she's always laughing and happy with everyone else.Misty's got enough problems on her plate without the moody sheriff turning up the heat.  She doesn't want to burden her sister with all she's facing, but between finding out she's pregnant, losing her job, and ending up with a criminal record, she's running out of options.  Morgan, though, for being such a by-the-book control freak, is a bit of a softie.  And once he gets the full story out of Misty, he steps up to make things a little easier for her, giving her a job and a reason to stay around while he unsuccessfully fights his feelings for her.Their romance was quite entertaining to watch, not only because they were clearly made for each other, but also because Morgan was so hilariously lost most of the time.  He couldn't stand losing control of himself, and that's the state Misty had him in all the time.  But he was also exactly what she needed, someone older and stable and responsible, who wouldn't rush to judgement about her and would give her a shot at something better than the future she thought was waiting for her.  Their constant bickering and undeniable attraction to each other made for a fun, steamy read.All in all, Buckhorn Beginnings is a quick, entertaining set of classic romance novel plots.  Both the Hudson brothers featured so far are white knights coming to the rescue of damsels in distress, but it plays out in such a way that you can't help but root for them and then laugh when they stumble.  Despite some of the heavier subject matter, the stories remain rather lighthearted, revolving around family, loyalty, and quite a bit of humor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDDTVF2CBXOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373776128#wasThisHelpful","R2EDDTVF2CBXOY","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vanity wants Stack, but she knows better than to go about getting him in the conventional way. Dating and relationships aren‚Äôt really his thing, and the last thing she wants is to become another notch in his bedpost ‚Äî or scare him off for good. So rather than simply make herself available to him, she plays unavailable, letting him think that a romp in the sheets is all she‚Äôs after. And if she plays her cards right, he‚Äôll keep coming back for more.The Verdict: At this point, all it takes to make me pick up a book is Lori Foster‚Äôs name on the cover, but if you follow my reviews, you probably already know that. The guys in the Ultimate series are all kinds of hot, and Stack‚Äôs been a fun one to follow in the previous books.Vanity has her sights set on Stack, but the tough fighter tends to turn tail and run at the first sign that a woman wants more than a one-night stand with him. But if she doesn‚Äôt do something, he‚Äôll never consider anything more than flirty friendship with her, so she offers him exactly what he thinks he wants ‚Äî sex. And nothing more. At the end of the last book, she put her plan into play, getting Stack to agree to be her date to the wedding, with a guarantee that they can turn up the heat afterward. And thinking Vanity‚Äôs not after more than one night of naked fun, Stack falls right into her trap.The chemistry between Stack and Vanity burns up the pages, so the story gets off to a fast but awesome start. As they get to know each other better, Vanity‚Äôs feelings simply grow deeper, and Stack starts feeling emotions he never expected. But it also comes to light just how much Stack values honesty in people, and Vanity hasn‚Äôt exactly been honest about her intentions. I won‚Äôt give it away, but it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out what their conflict becomes.Lori Foster has done it again, creating strong, likable women and the irresistible men they fall in love with. Every single page has substance, too, bringing Stack and Vanity closer together rather than relying on contrived drama to speed things up. If you haven‚Äôt checked out this series yet, do it NOW. The Ultimate series is the ultimate romance readers‚Äô story, and the hot, strong men are the icing on the cake.***FicCentral received this book from Harlequin (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GG0CD4DCP3OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFSZWVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GG0CD4DCP3OT","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Lucy accepts a house-sitting job from the wealthy family for whom her mother is the maid, she expects a lazy summer filled with reading, time alone, and easy earnings.  What she doesn't expect is for the guy next door to mistake her for anything other than the help ‚Äî or to romance her to the point of falling head over heels.But... While I loved the story, there was one point in the book where I really, really wanted to punch Lucy in the face for being a complete imbecile ‚Äî and it wasn't because of the whole ‚ÄúI'm pretending to be someone I'm not‚Äù scenario. Before Lucy really even knows Gabe, he's asking to come over to her place late at night, which has her immediately wondering just what he expects from her.  Her reasoning for deciding he's perfectly safe? This ‚Äúlogic‚Äù: ""Okay, I'm being ridiculous.  What is this guy going to do to me?  He's gorgeous.  He could have anyone he wants.  He's just looking for an escape from his family.""Really?  REALLY?!?  So because he's gorgeous, he's harmless?  Good-looking guys never hurt women?  That should make it really easy to stay safe.  Just avoid the ugly dudes, and crimes against women will cease to be a problem. Sure.Judging Covers: The cover for the previous book in the series struck me as utterly boring, but this one didn't really strike me as anything.  Does that mean I'm just used to the look now?The Verdict:  We met Gabe in Fair Game, and as Shep's best friend, he seemed like he could be a lot of fun, so I was interested in getting his story.  Like Shep, he's loaded and as brought up in a world of privilege, but in In the Dark, we see just how limiting that world can be.Gabe's parents are forcing him to do family time over the summer, so he and his sister are camped out in their luxury vacation home and trying to break the boredom.  And it's not just that he's more interested in hanging out with his friends than with his family;  it's that he's being dragged along for fancy dinners and black tie affairs and expected to make nice with whatever shallow young women are deemed suitable for someone in his ritzy social circle.  So when he spots the gorgeous girl next door, and she turns out to be genuine and different than the girls he usually meets, he's immediately intrigued.Lucy is used to getting by with virtually nothing.  Born to a teenage mother who has since gone a little overboard in trying to keep Lucy from making the same mistakes she did, Lucy's life has been a series of struggles and going without.  The house-sitting gig seems like easy money, and she doesn't really mean to pretend she's one of the wealthy people who live there, but since she'll probably never see Gabe again, she doesn't bother correcting him when he assumes she's just like him.  But what starts out as a bit of innocent fun quickly grows into real feelings.These two are absolutely perfect for each other, the very epitome of opposites attract.  Lucy's thrifty, focused on her future, and used to working hard for everything she has.  She's nothing like the girls Gabe usually finds, and everything about her personality (not to mention her looks) attracts him.  Gabe, on the other hand, is used to having everything handed to him, but it doesn't mean he necessarily enjoys all the other trappings of wealthy society life.  In fact, his rich boy issues have made him rather selfish and disconnected, but with Lucy, he finds something worth enjoying.  Their chemistry is ridiculously hot and makes for some awesomely steamy scenes.  But they also have fun together, and their teasing and banter kept me turning the pages as fast as I could drink in their story.Of course, their summer fling is supposed to come to an end when summer does, but things don't quite work out that way once they discover they're attending the same college.  And while Lucy certainly has feelings for Gabe, her insecurities have her running the opposite direction when she sees him.  Surprisingly, Gabe was the one who fought to keep her from walking away, and I loved the way he just sort of threw caution to the wind and gave her a chase.  But Lucy isn't exactly who she's allowed Gabe to assume she is, and when the truth comes out, the timing couldn't be worse.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that while I expected that rather standard turn in the plot, I did not expect it to play out quite the way it did.  In the Dark, for all its standard romance novel direction, surprised me, both with the depth of the characters and their realistic reactions to things.  Things didn't feel like they happened just for drama's sake or to advance the story but rather because that's how people of that age in that situation would truly react.  And of course, since the characters were so great, it was impossible not to root for them.  Gabe and Lucy's story is a pretty classic romance trope, but it's also fresh and believable.***FicCentral received this book from Wordsmith Publicity for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MHG2CH84QM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TL9S4U#wasThisHelpful","R4MHG2CH84QM5","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When her younger sister disappears without her medication, Holly drops everything to find her and bring her back home.  But her only real clues are the town to which she hoped never to return and the boy she couldn‚Äôt stand back in school.  The one-time bad boy has a chivalrous side, and as Holly finds herself leaning on him more and more, those negative feelings she once harbored spin in the other direction and have her longing for a relationship she‚Äôs not sure her life can sustain.  It‚Äôs up to Josh to show her that she‚Äôs not alone and that she deserves to have something wonderful for herself.But... *Sigh*  Just once could a bipolar character not be batshit crazy?  Yes, I know it‚Äôs a serious illness, and I know how important medication can be, and I know all about the psychotic breaks and the manic episodes and the feeling like the world is ending. I know because I‚Äôm bipolar.  But I also know what it‚Äôs like to remain functional and productive and independent without medication, and just once I wish fiction would portray that side of being a little bit nuts.  Seriously, despite what television and movies and books portray, we‚Äôre not all completely unhinged.The Verdict:  Holly‚Äôs life seems to have been a series of sacrifices.  It started when she and Grace, the oldest of four sisters, did their best to hide their mother‚Äôs mental illness from the younger twins, and even though their mother died years ago, it‚Äôs never really stopped.  All this time later, Holly is still trying to protect her sisters, at the expense of having a life of her own, and now that Portia has run off in the midst of a bipolar episode that‚Äôs frighteningly reminiscent of their late mother‚Äôs behavior, Holly finds herself dropping everything to go after her.The sisters‚Äô dynamic is disturbing, to be honest.  Grace got married and bailed on them, leaving Holly to deal with everything on her own.  Portia is bipolar and prone to going off her meds, and Emma is far too dependent and immature to handle anything responsibly.  Their mother (also bipolar) died years ago, and their father is too proud and ashamed to admit that anything has ever been wrong, so he‚Äôs essentially out of the picture.  How Holly has maintained any sanity is beyond me.Portia‚Äôs latest unmedicated adventure has her striking out for the town in which the girls once lived, though Holly can‚Äôt figure out why she was drawn there.  Whatever the reason, she knows she needs to find Portia before she winds up hurt or in the grip of a full psychotic break, so even though it‚Äôs the last place she wants to be, Holly heads off to find her. But her awful luck continues when her car and all her belongings are stolen and she has no one else to turn to except the now-grown boy she hated in school.While Josh certainly doesn‚Äôt understand everything that‚Äôs happening or why Holly seems to be holding such a strong grudge, he‚Äôs surprisingly chivalrous and pretty much insists on helping her ‚Äî despite all the resistance she throws his way.  And while Holly is loathe to admit it, the more time she spends with Josh, especially since he‚Äôs doing so much to help her, the more she finds herself liking him.Though there is a strong romantic theme to the story, Nobody‚Äôs Fool isn‚Äôt all fluffy reconnections and heading into the happily ever after.  Holly‚Äôs situation is a mess, and Portia‚Äôs apparent disconnect from reality makes things even more difficult for them all, especially on the romantic front.  Josh is always at Holly‚Äôs side, doing whatever he can to help and support her, but the story is heavily focused on the girls‚Äô journey to understand their past and Holly‚Äôs need to give up some of the burden she‚Äôs been carrying.  It‚Äôs a sobering look at the effects mental illness have on not just the individual but the entire family, and though it‚Äôs a very slow, often discouraging journey, that happily ever after finally comes through.***FicCentral received this book from Kensington Books (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2MLQMA8QEZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDYVAOM#wasThisHelpful","RV2MLQMA8QEZC","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third book in the Caged series, Released picks up precisely where Trapped left off, with Liam spiralling down into complete self-destruction now that Tria has left him.  And it's got me thinking‚Ä¶Liam is not your typical romance bad boy hero.  He's not just a collection of rough edges waiting to be smoothed by the right woman.  He's pretty severely damaged emotionally, and it shows in his reactive personality and lack of real attachment to anyone but Tria.  He didn't mean for her to leave, and his reasons for running out in a panic make sense, even if they're not an excuse for the way that action comes across.  But now that she's gone, he's beyond lost, and for a dangerous while, he lets the rest of his world fall apart.  For someone like Liam, rock bottom has a whole new meaning.We watch Liam fall apart, lose his job, wander the streets, and ask for help.  But finding Tria doesn't fix everything, and she's still not sure she can trust him to stay around and stay off drugs.  Still, he puts her and the baby first, and in a rather fortunate turn of events, they finally begin to reconcile.Released is a story of closure, a series of falls that lead to Liam finally facing his past, his problems, and his shortcomings with Tria and becoming a better man for it.  He can't erase the past, but he finally confronts it, allowing himself to see how his family wasn't alone in making poor choices, and eventually dealing with the grief and trauma he's been bottling up and only unleashing in cage fights for so long.  Fortunately, though, he doesn't lose that edginess that makes him such an interesting character to begin with.  He's still crass and crude, still prone to anger and overreaction, but he's also cognizant of the consequences of flying off the handle and avoiding responsibility.  Liam's journey from drifting to settling down is one hell of a read.***FicCentral received this book from TRSOR Promotions for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHT5BZMALKHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YTEKBU#wasThisHelpful","R2NHT5BZMALKHV","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Championship rodeo rider Dane Bowden knows everything hinges on this last ride.  He wants the win, and he needs the money, so he holds on with everything he's got.  But those few seconds change his life more than he could have imagined, when the bull turns on him and nearly kills him.  But a crushed leg isn't nearly as jarring as seeing the face of his angel again, the now-grown woman who disappeared after saving him so many years ago.The Verdict:  No one could ever say Bell has had it easy.  Abandoned by her mother to her already married father, she was then left to be raised by her grandparents.  While her grandfather always doted on her, her grandmother only sees her as sin incarnate, but despite that misery, Bell continues to take care of her bitter grandmother long after the sweet old man passes away.  Taught by him to love books and learning, Bell excelled in school and has gone on to become a surgeon, but for all her intellect, she never really learned how to interact with people.  Now that she's trying to connect with her half-sister and falling for an injured cowboy, some social skills would sure come in handy.Compared to what Bell went through, Dane's life has been easy.  Raised with his brothers in a loving family, he's hardworking, honest, and blessed with the kind of looks that have women swarming around him.  He's never forgotten the little girl that came to his rescue when he was thrown from his horse as a kid, but he's almost convinced himself that he just imagined her.  Except now that he's in danger of losing his mangled leg, he finds himself face to face with her once more, and this time, he's not letting her disappear.  She's awkward around him, but he's drawn to the sweet person inside, and he's got no problem fighting for her to stay in his life.The last of the Bowden brothers to fall in love, Dane's actually been half in love with the memory of the angel that saved him so many years ago.  Faced with her now, he soon finds out just how hellish her life has actually been, but he's determined to get her to open up to him and give them a chance together.  He seems to immediately connect with Bella on an emotional level, but Bell is absolutely inexperienced and out of her element in her growing feelings.  It's really sweet to watch Dane, previously quite the ladies man, patiently trying to win her over, and I was rooting for them from the get-go.  Of course, this story wouldn't fit the series if there weren't an element of danger to things, and it seems like someone is out to get Dane by going through Bell.  That just makes him more determined to take care of and protect her, though, and with sparks flying between them the whole time, their relationship simply gets stronger.Her Lucky Cowboy is another great story in an already incredible series and shows just how alike in heart opposites can be.  With lots of friendship, family, and heart-bursting romance, Jennifer Ryan has perfected another cowboy love story.***FicCentral received this book from Harper Collins (via Edelweiss) for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHL27O6LEP5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFOBLF8#wasThisHelpful","R3GHL27O6LEP5A","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The verbal sparring between Lemon McCoy and Tristan Lawson is practically a legend in their small town, but it hasn‚Äôt always been such a battle between them.  Years have passed, though, and their animosity toward each other hasn‚Äôt faded, making things that much harder when one night of giving into their attraction leads to pregnancy and a sudden marriage.The Verdict:  This story has been building since the beginning of the series, so of course I couldn‚Äôt wait to find out what was in store for Lemon and Tristan!Back when Tristan was deployed, he and Lemon sort of inadvertently became pen pals.  He shot off a quick, funny letter, she responded with her usual wit, and a friendship grew from there.  But what could have been their great love story was shot to hell when other people interfered, and Tristan and Lemon‚Äôs pride kept them both from revealing their true feelings for each other.  Fast forward several years, and they‚Äôre both still harboring plenty of attraction, love, and loathing for each other.  But one unexpected night together leads to an unplanned pregnancy, and they finally get their chance to make things right ‚Äî if they can put aside their barbs and let their hearts show a little.One of my favorite things about this series is the quick wit among all the characters, none more so than that between Tristan and Lemon.  There‚Äôs no denying the sexual tension between them, but they won‚Äôt let down their guards for one second around each other.  Fortunately, one night they let things go too far, and in forgoing the condom, they‚Äôve finally created a situation in which they have no choice but to show some vulnerability.The second Lemon told Tristan that she was pregnant, things started getting really good.  Even as he was trying to hide his feelings long enough for her to get more comfortable with him, his best side began shining through.  Of course, he‚Äôs a man, so he certainly screwed up once or twice, but he did his best to put Lemon and their child first.  Likewise, she didn‚Äôt hesitate to uproot her life to start a future with him.  Had their history been different, I probably would have thought they were both idiots for jumping into a hasty marriage, but even though they each claimed it was for the baby, it was clear it was for themselves, too.  They were careful not to reveal too much, but they were also surprisingly honest with each other, and when the whole truth finally came out, it was impossible not to mourn the time they‚Äôd lost.Lemon‚Äôs sister is a piece of work, and while I‚Äôm sure her story is coming up, there‚Äôs a part of me hoping it‚Äôs all miserable and angsty for a good long while.  She certainly deserves it after what she pulled.  But watching Lemon and Tristan reconnect was still awesome, and even though we definitely got a fully developed story, the pages flew by so fast!  Their background story allowed the quick pace of their relationship to flow seamlessly, and their chemistry was beyond perfect.  Love So Tempting is a fantastic, emotion-filled romance that had me rooting for the characters from page one.***FicCentral received this book from Wordsmith Publicity for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDJZJRKSN92R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRXVGF8#wasThisHelpful","R2BDJZJRKSN92R","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Still getting over the best friend he crushed on for so long, Mason needs distance, and he finds it by leaving town for the summer to work on a fishing boat with his uncle. But shortly upon arrival, he sees Felicity, a local waitress and perhaps the one to make him forget all about his broken heart.  But Felicity knows better than to get too involved with one of the ‚ÄúSummer Boys,‚Äù  those guys who come around to work or vacation for the summer and then return to their lives elsewhere.  It doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs above having a fun little fling, but falling for a Summer Boy was never in the plan.The Verdict:  This series just keeps surprising me in the best way, and I think this may be my favorite of the Crush books!

To get over it, he needs space, and to get space, he agrees to help out his uncle on a fishing boat for the summer.  It‚Äôs not something this computer whiz has any experience, but it just may be the change of pace he needs.  Throw in some seasickness and the hot girl in the next boat over, and it‚Äôs going to be a summer he won‚Äôt want to let go.Life has been terribly unfair to Felicity, and her story is just heartbreaking.  In trying to do the right thing, she broke up with her first love right around high school graduation, determined to see him chase his dreams and not be held back in a dead end, small town life with her.  But one night of too much drinking and a bad decision while drowning his sorrows ruined everything.  Felicity gave up the boy she loved only to have him get stuck changing diapers and trying to do the right thing by the girl he knocked up.  I can‚Äôt even explain how terrible I felt for the two of them, seeing her painful but selfless gesture get them nowhere, while Brody gave up his own heart to live up to his new responsibilities.  Reading their story and watching them awkwardly still care about each other is probably one of the saddest things I‚Äôve read in a story like this ‚Äî without being over the top.But then came Mason, a nice guy who perfectly matched Felicity in the humor and banter department, and it didn‚Äôt hurt that he was hot as hell.  His staying on the boat right next to hers had them running into each other, forming a cute friendship, and creating some serious chemistry.  Felicity, of course, had her walls up, both because her heart had been broken before and because she knew that in a few weeks, Mason would be returning to his life at college.  But despite both their best efforts, they were quickly in over their heads.It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear that Felicity had bigger issues; it just seemed like she was overly cautious due to past events.  But as things started playing out, it was great to see her grow and learn to follow her heart.  Mason was patient and sweet, frustrating and all boy, and when they were at odds, they both acted exactly like the flawed people they were.  In some ways, that made them even more perfect for each other.Just a Little Kiss is a sweet, mostly fluffy read with a little angst thrown in to balance things out, and it‚Äôs impossible not to fall in love with the characters.  I have no idea if the series is over, or if there will be more, but I‚Äôve got my fingers crossed that Isla will get her happily ever after soon.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VRPJX2ACL1W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04IRM2#wasThisHelpful","R2VRPJX2ACL1W9","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, this cover isn't the one that was on my book, so it appears that the series has gone through a minor cover overhaul.  The too-cutesy sign with the series name is gone, and it seems each book now has its own color scheme.  That's certainly better, but I wish they'd spent a little more time on finding a better font, or just left the old one  I know that probably seems really nit-picky, but it's a good series, and the covers just don't reflect that.The Verdict:  Dawson's Fall gives readers a lot more insight into why the Dawson siblings are so ostracized and scorned by the people of Covendale, and it also shows a lot more plainly just how unfair that is.As it turns out, the Dawson's father managed to kill himself while driving drunk years ago, and his life wasn't the only one lost.  He also killed a young, pregnant mother, and that woman's family turned their grief into hatred for all the Dawsons.  Never mind that they were just kids and weren't responsible for their father's poor decisions.  Never mind that the loss of their father left them parentless.  They've struggled to stay together and take care of each other ever since, and the townspeople have done them no favors.It was Aubrey Monroe's mother who was killed by the Dawsons' father, but she doesn't harbor the same ill will toward the remaining Dawsons.  That doesn't necessarily make things any easier for her, though, since her father and brother live and breathe loathing for the family of the man who tore their world apart.  But Aubrey and Mark Dawson had a spark between them once, back when they were teenagers, and when they come face to face again, it flares.  However, they've got to overcome their own reluctance to get involved despite the bad blood, and somehow they've got to overcome her family's objections.As is to be expected with this series, their romance is quick to develop and passionate, but that's not altogether unbelievable, since they're not exactly strangers.  And just as Aubrey is trying to get her dad and brother to let go of their hatred, she's also trying to assert her own independence in making choices as an adult, without having to bend to their judgement.  For his part, Mark is surprisingly understanding, and when faced with a moral choice, he makes the right one at risk to his own life.Dawson's Fall is another fun, steamy romance that makes for a quick read, and I'm a little sad to know I've only got one more book left in this series to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWDBB2ZU99KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYO3CXM#wasThisHelpful","R2HWDBB2ZU99KO","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Instead of showing up for the society wedding of the century, Samantha made a run for it, driving clear across the country with no clue where she was going or what she would do when she got there.  When the sleepy little town of Nugget had her hitting the brakes, she found herself with no work experience and no marketable skills.  But she's smart and willing to work hard, and her knowledge of planning classy events seems like it may come in handy at recently renovated Nugget Inn.  If only the owner wasn't such a jerk.The Verdict: Despite the fact that Samantha was from a wealthy, high society world that most of us can't even imagine, she was incredibly easy to like.  She appreciated finery and certainly didn't turn her nose up at the better things in life, but she was personable, hard working, and intelligent.  She didn't expect that the world would fall at her feet at the mention of her name (in fact, she pretty much hid and downplayed her identity as much as possible), and her thoughts and emotions were not those of someone spoiled rotten but rather of someone who simply wanted to find meaning in life.Nate is someone I never really warmed up to in previous books.  He wasn't a bad guy, sure, but he was rather stiff, and while he may have been generous enough to act as a donor when his best friend wanted to have a baby, we never really got to see much of Nate as a feeling human being ‚Äî until now.  His inner conflict regarding the daughter he technically fathered but wasn't a father to allowed for a deep look into what made the man tick, and it was impossible not to feel for him in that situation.  And then there was his past‚Ä¶Nate still harbored a lot of negativity after his fiance ran out on him before their wedding years ago, so Samantha's story of running off from her would-be groom definitely set him on edge.  The consummate businessman, Nate couldn't get past Samantha's lack of useful education and work history, and on the personal side of things, her situation felt to him like another betrayal.  No matter how nice she was, he couldn't see past his own issues ‚Äî at least for a long while ‚Äî and it took him a lot of time to finally let himself see who Samantha was on the inside.Both characters were strong and proud, so you can just imagine the head-butting that happened between them on an almost daily basis.  Their mutual attraction certainly complicated things as well, but proximity has a way of making people get to know each other, walls and all.  Plus, Samantha was such a sweetheart that it was only a matter of time before Nate fell for her.  Watching him fight it, though, was certainly entertaining!As with the previous books in the series, Samantha and Nate are complex and fully developed characters, and their main interactions aren't only with each other.  There's a full supporting cast of townspeople and family, all of whom enrich the plot and keep the story from straying into any dull territory.  The Nugget series is so well written and rich with both main stories and side stories that it's impossible to put any of the books down once I've started, and now I'm just dying to get my hands on whatever comes next!***FicCentral received this book from Kensington Books (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYYHVO63YGI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFYGDY8#wasThisHelpful","R3FYYHVO63YGI8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, Lucy left town in a whirlwind of chaos, dumping her boyfriend and stealing another one from someone else.  But life didn't turn out as ideally as she expected back then, and now that she's facing her personal demons, she has to face all the people she let down.  Back home with the parents she disappointed, she finds herself face to face with the man whose heart she left shattered.  And while years have passed, those old feelings haven't really changed.But... I spent a good chunk of the book wondering why American characters raised near Chicago spoke in a way that seemed distinctly British ‚Äî after I skipped back several pages to make sure I had the location correct.  From Lucy's use of the word bloody (which I suppose she could have plucked from her British ex) to her announcing her field of study as physiotherapy (that would be physical therapy to Americans), I was a little thrown.  Then there was the noticeable lack of contractions and a few turns of phrase that are pretty damned rare this side of the Atlantic.  Of course, when I looked up the author, it all made sense ‚Äì born in Britain and raised in South Africa.  Don't get me wrong; I don't expect authors who speak a hell of a lot more languages than I do to get the American dialect perfect, but I definitely expect the editors to catch it.  Still a good read, and the author's vocabulary is seriously impressive, but the editors‚Ä¶The Verdict:  I have to admit that I went into this book with all the wrong expectations.  I knew there would be some drama and angst, but I expected it to be a little more lighthearted ‚Äî for lack of a better word.  So it took me a little time to get on board with the slow-paced journey of a recovering alcoholic trying to make amends for her many liquor-fueled transgressions and finding love again somewhere along the way.Nine years ago, Lucy was the definition of a wild child.  Having now met her parents, I can only assume much of her misbehavior and subsequent addiction is the product of an insane home life, and when she left town, she burned every bridge she'd ever crossed.  Now back, she's working on the making amends part of a twelve-step program, and that means facing the parents she's disappointed and embarrassed, the classmate she relentlessly picked on, the former best friend whose boyfriend she skipped town with, and the man whose heart she shattered when she left.Richard has done well for himself since Lucy's abrupt departure, but while he's a successful doctor, his marriage is pretty much over.  Ashley, the woman he married, was once Lucy's best friend, and they were both victims to Lucy's selfishness and disregard for others.  Richard's been carrying around his anger for nearly a decade, and his estranged wife has never forgiven Lucy for her betrayal.  So when Lucy shows back up, making apologies and claiming to have changed, no one really wants to hear it.Lucy's story was sad to the Nth degree.  The consummate party girl, she'd left behind the man she loved for the excitement of the man who belonged to her best friend, and somewhere between leaving and coming back so many years later, she'd hit rock bottom.  A series of terrible decisions and shameful consequences, complete with a physically abusive boyfriend along the way, finally landed her in the hospital for the last time, and for three years, she'd been trying to beat the drink and learn to respect and love herself.Her reunion with Richard was tense, to say the least, and his anger wasn't just some overused plot device to cause conflict.  A big part of him really did hate her for breaking his heart the way she did, and it took plenty of concession on her part to get him to put down the verbal weapons and see the person she'd grown to be.  Their rekindling was incredibly slow-paced, and in that way it was also very realistic.  This wasn't the story of a woman miraculously saved by the perfect man to carry her off into the sunset.  Her parents were still awful, there were plenty in town who would rather she'd never returned, and a lot was revealed about just how difficult it is to crawl back from years of alcoholism.  I can't say that kind of struggle is something I enjoy reading about, but I have to admire the way the author didn't spare any humility or shame in telling it.At the heart of the story, though, was the second chance at happily ever after, and while it definitely took a while to get there, it was just perfect when things finally started coming together. As with the rest of the story, even that part wasn't easy, with Lucy's past being thrown in her face and the gossip mill fueled by none other than her mere presence.  Witnessing her humiliation was tough, but Richard (and his family) were nothing short of perfect.  Nobody's Angel is filled with drama, angst, and inner conflict, but it all felt very real right up through the end, finishing on a positive note without wrapping everything up in a way-too-neat bow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V7SG9MSWLK28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420137395#wasThisHelpful","R3V7SG9MSWLK28","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judging Covers:  Meh.  It seems like the cover designer has finally landed on a design theme, as this one has the same black and white thing going that the previous book in the series did ‚Äî and certainly a big improvement in the title font when compared to the first book.  But (and I'm guessing most readers won't have the same issue) I'm kinda tired of Mr. Icy Blue Eyes.  He's been floating around in the stock image world for at least a few years now, and he's on a lot of romance covers.  I'm also one of the 0.0008% of women in the world who don't find him attractive, so that's probably part of my issue.  Not that it has anything to really do with what's between the covers‚Ä¶The Verdict:  Well, Sidney Halston has done it again, delivering a solid and emotional story in Laid Out.  If I weren't so in love with the beginning of Against the Cage, this one would probably be my new favorite.  But while the first book began with an inadvertent nut punch, Laid Out has a more serious side.Violet, Cain, and Jeremy had once been practically inseparable.  But when Jeremy and Cain enlisted and were shipped off to the Middle East, things began to change.  Cain blew off that first kiss he'd given Violet the day he was leaving, and Jeremy pursued her wholeheartedly.  They grew up as time went by, became engaged, and were planning a future together.  But then tragedy struck, leaving both Violet and Cain to grieve someone they never thought they'd have to live without.  Enough time has gone by that the grief isn't fresh, but it's still just as deep.  And now, there's an added sense of loyalty keeping Cain from acting on the feelings he's harbored for Violet for years, and the stand-offish way that Cain's acting has Violet questioning their friendship.  However, Violet isn't living in the past, and she's ready to move forward with her life, but successfully navigating the dating world is proving to be a challenge.  She asks Cain to help her with that, to basically teach her how to seduce a man, and that's when things start to get interesting.Even before it was spelled out for readers, it was pretty clear that Cain had stepped aside for Jeremy and that he had never really gotten over his feelings for Violet.  Their years of friendship, common ground regarding their fathers' cold approach to parenting, and their loss of Jeremy pretty much guaranteed they'd be spending more time together once they had a chance to reconnect.  Happenstance has them living in the same town again, but it's Cain's masochistic agreement to more or less tutor Violet that gives them a fighting chance.Violet is rather easy to like in her loyalty to Cain, despite his sometimes less than friendly attitude, and even for the way she's grown since losing Jeremy.  Yes, she truly loved him and would have gladly spent the rest of her life with him, and the story didn't take that annoying excuse for a turn where she suddenly realized Jeremy had been all wrong for her.  It seemed like the proper way to handle a deceased love interest, not skewering him with some revealed secret or turning him into some mediocre guy in memories.  But as you can surely imagine, Violet and Cain coming together meant clearing some emotional hurdles, since there's no handbook for how to forge ahead with your dead best friend's girl.  Oh, and it definitely helped from a reader's perspective that Violet was no Skinny Minnie, instead being a little on the plus-size side of things, but only in a way that made her curvier, not ridiculously self-conscious or ashamed.Cain was a little more difficult for me to connect to, simply because he was so guarded with everything, hiding his feelings and giving one-word answers when talking to Violet.  But he was hot as hell, and his feelings for her were clearly genuine and deep.  Surprisingly, he managed to keep from taking Violet straight to bed, and when given the chance to make something more out of their friendship, he really didn't hesitate despite his conflicted emotions.I think it's safe to say that Laid Out is probably the most emotional book in this series yet, dealing with old friendships, devastating loss, redefining the future, and all the issues that come from having gone to war.  If you'd told me after reading Against the Cage that there'd be a story like this one in the series, I probably wouldn't have believed it, but Sidney Halston's characters aren't slightly modified versions of each other, and each story and couple has proven to be quite a bit different than the ones who've come before them.  I'm still loving this series, and I can't wait to get my hands on the next piece of it!***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0U3A0QSQYRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1J5M8#wasThisHelpful","R2A0U3A0QSQYRP","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a marriage that nearly killed her, Emma's just trying to start over in a new town, where perhaps her past won't come back to haunt her anymore than it already does. The last thing she's looking for is a new relationship, especially with a man who's known for throwing punches, but when Gage Dawson comes into her life, all bets are off.But... There were parts of the plot that simply didn't add up, primarily Emma's noticeable lack of hesitation when it came to involving herself with Gage. A woman who was terrorized by the last man she loved probably wouldn't have run so quickly into the arms of a man she'd just met, one who was vilified by the community and quick to punch back. Granted, she saw a softer side of him, and he never once did anything the least bit threatening to her, but this part of the story simply didn't fit well. It made the past abuse seem like a convenient excuse to throw in a bit of violence toward the end, which I doubt was the point. I know the stories in this series are short, and that must certainly affect how much development can be done, but neglecting this very important part of Emma's character in favor of getting to the next scene made this bit feel particularly rushed and unfinished.Judging Covers:  Nope, my feelings about the covers in this series haven't changed.The Verdict: Dawson's Stand starts off with a bang, placing us in the last terrifying moments of Emma's relationship with her now-ex-husband. Fast forward a year, and it's clear that while she's survived and moved on, she's still trying to get her life back together.Gage is one of the Dawson boys, now grown men, whom the town loves to hate. In previous books, I don't think we got a good look at just how despised the Dawsons are, probably because Sydney was best friends with Luka and because the second book took us into Luka's love life. But in Dawson's Stand, we see that the Dawsons are loathed, blamed for any ugly situation that occurs when they're around, and even targeted for trouble. It's like the town is filled with bullies, all out to get the Dawsons, and the guys have no choice but to his back when provoked.There were certainly some things about this book that were perfectly written and really stood out, such as the opening scene and later when Emma came to Gage's rescue. The moment Emma was in danger toward the end, the town's hatred for Gage shined its brightest, and the suspense was so sharp it was almost painful. Even the moment where everything changed, and Gage was finally allowed to run off to save Emma was pretty incredible.  I don't want to give anything away, but suffice it to say, the drama in this one was a nail-biter and had me turning the pages as fast as I could.  Dawson's Stand was an entertaining read, just long enough to tell a good story and just short enough to get to the next book quickly!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LZY9TBNAM3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USJ41N0#wasThisHelpful","R10LZY9TBNAM3R","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sky is a dreamer, a free spirit who follows her heart and waits for the universe to show her what's next.  Having recently purchased the tattoo shop where she works, she seems to have everything in line except for a love life.  But with all her friends paired up with the loves of her life, she's hoping the universe will next bring her that missing piece.Sawyer has taken on the burden of his father's future, and the last thing he needs is a distraction.  But the minute he sees Sky, he's in over his head, and the attraction between them is instant and mutual.  His own future is uncertain, though, despite his determination to win his next match and secure the money needed to ensure his parents aren't left struggling when his father's condition continues to deteriorate.  But a boxer and a gentle dreamer hardly seem like a match, and he can hardly promise her his heart when his next fight might take his life.The Verdict:  I should know better than to be surprised by Melissa Foster's books.  After all, it's pretty much a guarantee that I'm going to love every one of them.  But once again, her intriguing characters defy romance novel standards and pack more depth and complexity than I can do justice to in a review.Sky is not your typical artsy, flighty, rootless wanderer.  Sure, she's into poetry and tattoos and letting the universe determine her path, but she's also incredibly loyal to friends and family, and it seems she knows exactly who she is, even if she's not sure yet what life will bring next.  Sawyer's seemingly effortless lyrics at open mic night, and the emotion he packs behind them, speak to her through her initial assumption that he's just another egotistical man.While Sawyer may throw punches for a living, he's also got a more genuine, softer side that somehow fits him perfectly.  I'm sure that in any other book, a hot fighter reciting poetry would be just this side of ridiculous, but Melissa Foster manages to blend those conflicting characteristics into the ideal man.  He's not entirely without problems, though, as his father, once a tough soldier, is suffering a progressing neurological disorder, and Sawyer is determined to do whatever it takes to make sure he's taken care of for however long he has left.  But it's that love and loyalty that puts everything on the line.A successful boxer who's stayed close to home to look out for his parents, Sawyer knows that he's just a punch or two away from suffering the same fate that afflicts his father.  But if he doesn't take on this next title match, he's not sure how to afford the inevitable nursing care his father will require, and he can't allow his mother to bear that responsibility alone.  But his career is also an issue for Sky, a woman who can't even bring herself to step on a bug, much less comprehend how the respectful, gentle (but still incredibly hot) man she knows can give and take a beating for a living.The relationship between Sky and Sawyer builds fast, and their chemistry together is not something either of them is able to resist.  In truth, they're a lot a like inside, and they see that compatibility almost immediately upon spending time together.  But while it may sound too quick on paper, the very real feelings between them made it feel more natural than breathing.  Without giving away the end, I'll say that their journey together is not at all what I expected and absolutely everything I love about romance.  There's friendship and lust, something bigger than love, and throwing caution to the wind despite the differences they have on the surface.  I soaked up every page of their thoughts and feelings, eagerly turning the pages for just a little more right up to the end.It's no secret that I love Melissa Foster's stories, her unique characters, and her ability to turn what should be just another romance into something I just can't put down, but I think this one's going straight to my all-time favorites list.***FicCentral received this book from Tasty Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVB8HZ80QV9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8A3ZV8#wasThisHelpful","R2FVB8HZ80QV9E","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Sara Renault fires Rory O‚ÄôConnor from his part-time job at an art museum, his reaction is nothing like anyone would expect.  Instead of anger or resentment or even disappointment, he kisses her.  And thus begins an adventure of a relationship.An Irish actor and musician, Rory‚Äôs time in the United States is running out, and he‚Äôs desperate to get his green card, so he can stay.  His plan is to marry a friend, but that puts an awkward kink in his budding relationship with Sara who, quite understandably, isn‚Äôt very keen on dating a married man.  The only logical solution in this illogical mess is for Sara to marry him, allowing him to stay in the States and see where their relationship takes them.But... Rory is the narrator, and while his telling of the story is entertaining, his voice is rather manic and erratic, so it took some getting used to.  At first, I was a bit irritated with him, wondering how I was supposed to like someone who came across as terribly impulsive and rushing through each emotion, but as I got to know him, he began to make more sense.  I can‚Äôt say I ever completely warmed to him, but he wasn‚Äôt so bad after all.The Verdict:  It‚Äôs no secret that dogs are my favorite people, and my life has revolved around one furry child after another for decades.  So it should come as no surprise that I didn‚Äôt hesitate to grab a book about a woman so crazy about her dog that it impacts her relationships. That sort of thing just makes sense to me.With Rory‚Äôs residency in jeopardy, he finds himself unemployed, still waiting for his big Hollywood break, and falling fast for the woman who fired him.  It‚Äôs absolutely the worst time to be worried about having to return home an ocean away from everything he‚Äôs ever wanted.  The only feasible solution, it seems, is to marry Sara, whom he likes an awful lot but still doesn‚Äôt know incredibly well.  Before long, they‚Äôre living together in a marriage of convenience while exploring the beginnings of the relationship they have formed.Sara, however, is more than a little attached to her dog Cody, and it doesn‚Äôt take long for that to become a point of contention.  With his green card in hand and the lead role in a new TV pilot, though, things seem to be going mostly Rory‚Äôs way.  But just as he and Sara are planning their big move to L.A., Cody disappears, the four-legged victim of a kidnapping that turns out to be all Rory‚Äôs fault.Obviously Sara is furious and devastated and completely lost without the dog she loves so much, and Rory is desperate to redeem himself and fix everything for her.  What follows is an adventure of a chase halfway across the country in pursuit of Cody and so much further in their own relationship.  Their journey is filled with emotion, humor, and some truly wonderful secondary characters.  Stepdog is one read I‚Äôd absolutely recommend to any romance lover who‚Äôs ever been nuts about a dog.***FicCentral received this book from Harper Collins (via Edelweiss) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3T9399EFUG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062369474#wasThisHelpful","R3L3T9399EFUG1","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had this one pre-ordered the second it was available, and you'd better believe I dropped what I was reading the second it hit my Kindle. After The Young World, I just had to know what would happen next.There's a particular pattern when it comes to trilogies, and so far, this one is following it to a T. The first book is awesome chaos, drawing you in and leaving you dying to get to the next part of the story. The second book is a bridge, resolving some things from the first part and setting you up for the ultimate resolution in the next installment. And the final book sees everything coming together and ending exactly the way you want it to (ummm‚Ä¶hopefully). I can only hope it sticks to that formula, since the way this one ended had me all kinds of frustrated.In The Young World, we saw the end of society as we know it. The youngest children died from a mysterious illness, as did all the adults. All that's left are teens, and with them in charge, everything is in chaos. Without authority, order, or all the trappings of modern technology, things have gone the way of Lord of the Flies, and Darwin's theory regarding the fit is playing out across the country. Some teens have remained inherently good, helping the ones they can while doing their best to remain safe and alive, and some have turned their enclave of the city into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. But the end of The Young World leaves us with a clue that all is not as it seems, with at least a few adults still around and capable of restoring order, should they see fit.As it turns out, the end of the world didn't really happen. It was simply the end of the United States, and elsewhere, life continues as it always has. The American military is still a force to be reckoned with, and they're located around the globe to protect their interests and (hopefully) rebuild the country. Donna and Jefferson have been separated, but they eventually find themselves back together on an aircraft carrier, surrounded by soldiers who seem to want information from them.More and more facets of what really happened are revealed, and it's the stuff of dreams for conspiracy theorists the world over. Add in the not-so-subtle commentary that pertains to our very real present world (the reorganization of global markets due to the collapse of America, etc), and The New Order is a brilliant observation of modern society. But back to the story‚Ä¶On the military ship, it's pretty bleak and scary, though nothing really seems to happen for a while. There's a sense of being left out of the loop, of being wanted for something more than what's being admitted, and certainly of imprisonment. When the group is finally allowed back together, my heart just soared because‚Ä¶ Well, it's Jefferson and Donna! But of course this is the aftermath of the apocalypse, and being plucked out of the hellhole they were in doesn't mean they're all saved. But how exactly does one escape hundreds of soldiers on an aircraft carrier far out of sight of land?It's hard to write this review without giving away some major turns in the story, but the things I can't talk about are the things I have the strongest opinions about. Their time on the island with the psycho doctor did in fact yield a cure, so it's no longer about living in the moment; it's about living, period. But the United States is still a disaster, kids are still dying (mostly from killing each other), and Jefferson's little crew is getting precious few answers. But just as everything seems to be coming together, it all falls apart again, separating our teen lovebirds a way that makes reuniting feel impossible (though I'm sure it's not), and taking readers on a journey deep into Dammit! I just want them to be together land.And that's pretty much where it ends. There's lots and lots of intriguing stuff in between, including a look at the rest of the world still functioning as if nothing ever happened, a ‚Äúreturn from the dead,‚Äù and a gigantic clue as to why it all happened in the first place, but for me, it all comes down to that ending. Well, hello, cliffhanger‚Ä¶ Guess I'll be chewing my nails off in anticipation of the final book, huh?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KMWSLM3NJRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGG5YFE#wasThisHelpful","R21KMWSLM3NJRW","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liam and Tria have been living together for a while now, but only recently has their cohabitation arrangement moved into romantic relationship territory.  Sure, they've both had feelings for each other for some time, but they've been tight-lipped about them until they just couldn't hold back anymore.  But Liam's messy past and Tria's reasons for carving out her own future are some big challenges to overcome, and nothing about their moving forward will be easy.But...I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed that this is virtually the same story I read in its previous incarnation.  That's not to say it isn't still incredibly entertaining or just as good; it's just that I was hoping it would include something new for those of us who've read it before.  There aren't a lot of authors I follow from the fic world to the published one, but I definitely appreciate it when they throw in a new twist or something unexpected, setting it apart from earlier versions.  Shay Savage's stories are pretty unique either way, and that's what makes them so much fun to read, but I would think that their inherent differences from the usual published fare would make them that much more receptive to shaking up the plot a bit.The Verdict:  If the three books in this series weren't be released in fairly quick succession, I'd be having a fit right about now ‚Äî I can only imagine what it's like for those that don't know how it all concludes!  Caged was obviously the intro, the meet the characters and establish a foundation for their relationship story, and Released will bring it all to an awesome end, but it wouldn't be fair to call Trapped filler.  If anything, it ties everything together so far.Tria has tried hard to be independent, but at this point, it's fair to say she's anything but.  That's not to say she doesn't have an inner strength; she's just not well equipped to handle life completely on her own.  With her background, though, it's no wonder.  From the unstable childhood to the feelings of inadequacy to the isolated and completely backwards way she was raised, she can't exactly get off the bus in a big city and immediately stand on her own two feet.  But in Trapped, we do see a silent strength in her, more than just determination or perseverance.  She may be rather subdued compared to Liam, but he brings out in her a hint of confidence she uses to stand up for herself.Liam's past hasn't exactly been a secret thus far, but it's much uglier and damaging to him than was previously disclosed, and his way of dealing with it is to forget about it as best he can.  The effects of what he's been through bleed through in his anger, though, an anger he still bears toward his family and that he now projects on to pretty much everyone and anyone who's not Tria.  Her vulnerability seems to be the only thing that initially prevented him from treating her like he does anyone else who tries to get close, and it's that time to bridge the distance between them that has allowed him to fall head over heels for her.Their romance is in some ways textbook ‚Äî boy saves girl, they fall in love, they face some obstacles.  But it's also unconventional compared to the rest of the genre, in that nothing is handed to them or seems to magically work out for them.  They're scraping by on his fight winnings and making do with practically nothing.  Liam's lingering anger and blame toward his family keeps him from accepting any financial help, and his issues often have him saying or doing the wrong thing when it comes to Tria.For those that, like me, have read this story before, Trapped doesn't offer anything new, but it does maintain the crazy romance and emotional adventure that made us love it in the first place.  While I know what's coming in the next book, I still can't wait to read it and see it all play out.***FicCentral received this book from TRSOR Promotions for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AK4SSECFDMC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RRZ0E6#wasThisHelpful","R1AK4SSECFDMC8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been years since Lauren has seen Chase, years since her parents died and left her to raise her sisters and run the ranch, years since Chase stepped in and helped her hang on to the one thing that seemed to keep what was left of her family together.  But now Chase is back, not to call in her debt but to work at his dad's veterinary practice ‚Äî and work on making a place for himself in Lauren's life.But... Upon the deaths of her parents, Lauren learned that her father had taken a rather large loan from two good friends, with the stipulation that if it wasn't paid back, they were to take over managing the ranch.  Rather than lose the ranch, Lauren agreed to let Chase give her the money, but in exchange, he insisted they get married.  Part of me can understand that a young guy looking to hang onto the girl he loved might manipulate things that way, and it's not like he didn't let her continue to lead her own life without him.  But I can't really understand why Lauren didn't eventually seek to get the marriage annulled.  They weren't tied together in any way except on paper, and it just didn't make sense that she (a) let herself get roped into a marriage that was just a big secret, and (b) let that hang over her forever.The Verdict:  I grabbed Loving Lauren as part of a Kindle freebie sale, and it's clearly the start to an incredible series.  For as much as I didn't understand the marriage for money bit, especially since Chase simply left for college and never spoke of it again, Lauren's story was very interesting.She's stubborn and self-reliant, giving up everything to care for her younger sisters, maintain the family ranch, and hang on to what she can of her pride.  Her determination to pay Chase back, even though that was never part of the deal, has her scrimping and saving money she could really use on the aging house she can barely maintain.  Her relationship with her sisters is sometimes rocky, but in that sense it's real.  She does the best she can to keep her family from falling apart.Chase's reemergence in her life is a shock, and she does her best not to face it.  But she can't deny her attraction to him, and he's certainly not doing anything to stay away from her.  Before she knows it, she's falling into something of a relationship with him, even when she won't really admit that she needs him, and for his part, Chase is amazingly patient and understanding.  Lauren's life has been all about the family, the ranch, and the finances, all at the expense of any semblance of a personal life, so Chase's slow approach to moving forward with her was exactly what she needed.  Granted, he still had to push a little, if for no other reason than to counter her stubbornness, but it made him the perfect romantic hero.I'd love to say I'm going to stick with this series, but we all know how limited my book budget is, and I'm not sure I can swing the other six books to finish it off. Then again, if they show up on Kindle Unlimited, I might be set.  But it sounds like until I can convince the Austin Public Library to buy them (of course I've already submitted the requests!) I'll have to find another country-themed romance to tide me over‚Ä¶","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8OYDVWOZA4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J096MG8#wasThisHelpful","RQ8OYDVWOZA4N","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up with incredibly conservative parents, Delilah has learned to be ashamed of her attraction to women, not just hiding it, but actually avoiding any chance of developing a relationship with another woman.  But now that her parents are gone, she's faced with the juxtaposed feelings of freedom to do what she wants and shame about who she is.  Falling for someone won't be as simple as it is for most people, as it means embracing herself and getting past what her late parents may have thought of her choice in a lover.But... I'm not sure I can get on board with how bisexual women were portrayed in the book.  Mind you, it wasn't a gigantic label applied to them all, but the couple of them who were part of the story were incapable of remaining faithful, as there was always that pull to the other sex.  I'm positive this wasn't intentional, simply because that's not the feeling I get from Melissa Foster's myriad of characters, not to mention the plots of the upcoming books in this series.  But at least for now it seemed to marginalize those who happen to enjoy both sides of the fence.Judging Covers:  Simply beautiful, just as I expected.  And obviously two women, which I wouldn't point out, except that sometime after signing up to review Discovering Delilah, another email arrived to spell out that it's a lesbian love story.  I can only guess that someone who hadn't paid the least bit of attention to Delilah's blatantly stated sexual orientation in the first book as well as the complete lack of male presence on the cover of this one was somehow shocked at the subject matter, creating worry that the rest of us might be equally oblivious.  I don't understand humans.  Still, gorgeous cover that's just perfect for the book.The Verdict:  Delilah knows she shouldn't be ashamed of who she is, but that's a hard obstacle to overcome when all she ever heard from her conservative parents was how homosexuality was wrong.  Even being around friends and her brother who are not just tolerant but 100% welcoming of people regardless of sexual preference, she's having trouble finding her place.Despite her reluctance to even think about a relationship, she's pretty much fallen head over heels for her good friend Ashley, but she has no idea if her advances, clumsy as they're sure to be, will be welcomed or humiliatingly rejected, and the insecurity is killing her.  Then there's the fact that she's never even dipped a toe in being-with-a-woman pool, so while she knows what she wants, she's a nervous wreck about her lack of knowledge and experience.  What should have been the awkward fumbling of growing up and experimenting now feels like crippling ignorance, and she's terrified of disappointing the woman she wants to be with, a woman who's no stranger to same sex relationships.Another friend Janessa, who just so happens to be bi, actually ends up something of a catalyst for Delilah's change ‚Äî if not immediately being able to accept herself, at least being able to move ahead with who she is.  Offered a no-strings-attached first experience, Delilah goes for it, taking advantage of the opportunity to learn from Janessa without judgement and become more comfortable with what she wants.  This was the scene I was most uncomfortable with, not because it was two women but because if I'm thinking of Delilah and Ashley like I would any other couple on a romance novel, Delilah shouldn't have been with Janessa at all.  Had this been your standard male/female romance, and the guy hooked up with a friend because he wanted to basically learn sex, we would have expected him to (a) turn out to be a total douche, or (b) fall in love with that friend and live happily ever after.  I really, really, really wanted Delilah's first experience to be with Ashley, so as well-intentioned as the night with Janessa was, it made me all kinds of uncomfortable.  However, Delilah's not your standard romance heroine, and her fears about a relationship are certainly much different and more real than the usual contrived fears we read about in standard romances, so it's hard to completely judge.Ashley, Delilah's best friend and giant crush, is out and open, but she has promised herself that she will never again fall for a girl who's still in the closet.  You see, her previous relationship went up in flames when she discovered that her girlfriend wasn't just still in the closet but was actually involved with a man behind her back.  Perhaps that ex had real feelings for her and was simply showing the world what they expected to see, but it also felt a bit like she made Ashley an experiment to satisfy curiosity.  It's hard to say, but it definitely messed Ashley up.Discovering Delilah did a wonderful job of exploring just how difficult it must be for someone to come out when not only surrounded by judgement but actually raised in it.  For every real-life story of parents and loved ones accepting family members who aren't ‚Äústraight,‚Äù there are dozens more in which people are ostracized and persecuted.  Delilah's struggle with everything about her sexuality, from how to simply be to what others may think of her is an emotional ride, and Melissa Foster did a wonderful job of not only portraying Delilah's coming of age, but also showing every aspect of self-reflection in the process, from shame to confusion to determination and love.  It's a sweet, sad, ultimately hopeful love story, and I can't wait to see where this series goes next.***FicCentral received this book from Brook Cottage Books for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCBBECERG9AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941480128#wasThisHelpful","R2JCBBECERG9AH","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harper can hardly remember a time when Cole wasn‚Äôt practically a part of her family, but her unrequited crush has kept her in avoidance mode for the past several years.  It‚Äôs one thing to develop feelings for your best childhood friend, but it‚Äôs quite another when that same friend dated your beautiful sister for years in high school.  But when family loss and responsibilities bring her home, her feelings are hard to deny, and when Cole seems to reflect some of those very same feelings, things just might get messy.But... There‚Äôs a LOT to this story, so much more than just simple romance.  There are family issues, problems with the ranch they‚Äôve inherited and now have to figure out how to save, arguments about preserving the land versus drilling for oil, and a whole host of other drama to deal with.  And to be honest, it‚Äôs all really interesting and kept The Bride Wore Denim from being just another predictable romance novel.  But with all that going on in the characters‚Äô lives, the romance part was extremely slow to develop.  I can‚Äôt say I got bored, but I definitely began to wonder if they were ever going to get around to that first kiss, much less anything else.  Having read it now, I can tell you that yes, it happens eventually, but it‚Äôs a long, long wait, so this book is definitely not for the impatient.The Verdict: As I mentioned, The Bride Wore Denim had an awful lot happening all at once, very much like it does in real life.  With the death of her father, it‚Äôs now up to Harper and her sisters to figure out what to do with the ranch, whether to pursue oil on the land (and potentially destroy part of it in the process), how to deal with a second tragedy, whether to continue pursuing their dreams and careers or give it all up to come home‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs not the half of it.  But while I may have been itching for Harper and Cole to finally give into their feelings just the tiniest bit, I can also appreciate that these characters and their lives were so well developed that the story wasn‚Äôt just all about finding a happily ever after.  It was certainly about love but also about family and all the other obstacles life throws at people whether they‚Äôre ready or not.Harper pretty much had me at cochins.  While she grew up, went to school, and began pursuing an art career, she was definitely a country girl at heart, and how could I not identify with that?  She was the best combination of awkward, passionate, intelligent, and creative, and while she could admit to herself that she had some feelings for Cole, she was loyal enough to her sister that she tried to tamp down those feelings ‚Äî and realistic enough to be a little squicked out about their dating history.  And Cole, who could have tried to rush things once he realized Harper had at least some feelings for him, was just better than that, knowing that Harper had an overly full plate and respecting her enough that he didn‚Äôt push to complicate her life with a relationship before she was ready.But I think what stood out most about the story was the realistic and detailed way it reflected just how difficult and chaotic life can be.  There‚Äôs grief over the loss of Harper‚Äôs father, issues getting along with her sisters, disagreements about who should take on what responsibilities, and exactly the kind of conflict and unconditional love that is simply normal family dynamics ‚Äî on top of the romantic interest!  Selvig could have written her characters and plot to immediately launch into saving the ranch and pursuing a relationship, but instead she allowed them to marinate in indecision and complicated choices, making sure they didn‚Äôt rush headlong into some pre-determined future or serendipitously stumble upon the magic answer to every problem.  Sure, I was a bit on the impatient side regarding the delay of the kissy parts, but I can‚Äôt deny that the thickly woven, detail-rich plot had me hooked within the first chapter.  It‚Äôs impossible not to want every other book in this series right this minute.***FicCentral received this book from Harper Collins (via Edelweiss) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHXXSK6ZQ33O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLVDH9W#wasThisHelpful","R1MHXXSK6ZQ33O","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Justin wasn't looking for a relationship ‚Äî or anything even close to one.  But when a very famous, very pregnant woman crashes on the road just in front of his veterinary practice, he finds himself offering her help and trying to deny the sparks of attraction that fly between them.  After all, she's married and clearly carrying another man's child.  But his heart has other ideas.The Verdict: I'm sort of over my penchant for romances in which the regular person falls in love with someone ridiculously famous, but I couldn't pass up the chance to read another story by T.J. Kline.  And of course, I loved it!Justin has been the meddling big brother in previous books, and while it was always clear that he was a good guy, it was hard to really get to know him.  He's always been all business ‚Äî except when it comes to looking out for family ‚Äî and finally getting a look inside his mind was really interesting!  For one, he was a little angry and put out by Alyssa's need for help, but he didn't have it in him not to lend a hand.  That right there made him a lot more believable than the typical white knight who's head over heels in five minutes and ready to play protector.Alyssa's not your typical celebrity, either.  She made a big name for herself in Hollywood, but then her marriage to a power-hungry agent happened, and it's all been downhill from there.  He's more or less sabotaged her career and left her nearly a has-been just a few years after the height of her fame, and now that she knows for certain that he's been cheating, she's completely lost.  Not to mention alone and without a plan.  On the outside, her life looks perfect, but on the inside, she's desperately trying to figure out who she is and what her next step should be.  The last thing she expects is for the cowboy who comes to her rescue to rescue her heart as well.Her car crash is serious enough to send Justin running to help but minor enough that she walks away without a scratch.  However, she's now stranded at Justin's country veterinary practice, urging him to save the dog (and soon puppies!) that caused her to wreck in the first place, and struggling internally with what her next move should be.  I love that Justin didn't immediately know who she was, though I could have done without his immediate judgement of her once he realized her famous identity.  Fortunately, he's fairly quick to recognize that she's not as glamorous and perfect as the tabloids would have everyone think, and while he's not sure they have anything in common, he's also not about to fall for the media gossip.Justin's pride and Alyssa's lost sense of self-worth are the biggest obstacles between them, though you'd think her pregnancy would be an issue.  Surprisingly, Justin's only real issue with that is that she's just coming out of a relationship, which really raised him up in my opinion.  Instead of worrying what other people might think or that he was rushing into things too quickly, he followed his feelings and allowed himself to become involved during a situation that would have most men running for the hills.Alyssa's husband was simply reprehensible, and I could have done without Justin falling for his lies, but at the same time, I can't really blame him considering the whole crazy scenario.  I mean, who among us wouldn't be insecure when it came to holding onto the heart of someone who'd been on a hundred magazine covers?  Their relationship seemed at first to move too quickly, but in reality it was several weeks into things before it got deeply serious on an emotional level they were each willing to admit, which sounds just about right for new love.  And of course, she's exactly what he needs to loosen up a bit and give into his feelings, and he's exactly what she needs to help her stand on her own two feet again.Close to Heart is the story of finding love when you least expect it, when you aren't even looking for it, and in the most difficult of circumstance, which is a big part of what makes it such a wonderful story.  T.J. Kline has once again served up complex characters with plenty of personal obstacles to overcome, and the result is an unexpected and altogether sweet romance.***FicCentral received this book from Harper Collins (via Edelweiss) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HV8M2VSV8UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP1K74O#wasThisHelpful","R3HV8M2VSV8UJ","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a terribly traumatic experience followed by years away from home, Maggie‚Äôs returned to the States to get her life back.  And who better to help her figure it all out than her best friend Shane?  Except Shane‚Äôs been in love with her forever, and Maggie‚Äôs about to ask him for a favor that will change things between them forever.The Verdict: I didn‚Äôt really even look to see what this story was about before grabbing it.  I just knew that I‚Äôd read everything else so far in the series, and I didn‚Äôt want to miss the next one.  So if you know anything about my favorite kinds of romance novels, you certainly aren‚Äôt surprised that I was thrilled to find out Hold Me Close is about best friends falling in love.First of all, trigger warning.  The incident is well in the past and not disgustingly graphic, but fair warning to those who who‚Äôd prefer to avoid the subject matter of sexual assault in a story.  Moving on‚Ä¶Maggie was raped by an ex-boyfriend and has had all kind of (understandable) trouble gaining her confidence and sense of security again.  For the last several years, she‚Äôs been in Europe, but now she‚Äôs back and ready to take control of her life.  Shane, her best friend, has been more or less in love with her since the beginning of time (or somewhere close to that), but time and circumstances were never in their favor.  Now that she‚Äôs back, he‚Äôs hoping he‚Äôll finally have his chance, but he never expected it to be the kind of chance she throws at him.Moving forward with her life again, Maggie‚Äôs in a better place, but sex hasn‚Äôt been a very comfortable thought for a long time.  However, she trusts Shane, knows that she can be vulnerable with him without any fear of being hurt emotionally or physically, and for this reason she asks him to help her get over the final hurdle standing in her way.  Sex.Shane wants what happens between them to be more than just physical or therapeutic.  He wants it to be everything, the way she‚Äôs been his everything for so long.  But he knows better than to push or take advantage of the situation, and so we meet one of the sweetest, most patient romance novel heroes I‚Äôve read about in a long, long time.It‚Äôs not often that a plot that takes this turn can truly hold my attention without sending me into manic eyerolls, but the strong, genuine, established friendship between these two kept things pretty interesting and believable.  It‚Äôs clear they love one another dearly, even when they haven‚Äôt really crossed the friendship line, and before long, they‚Äôre trying to figure out just how much this agreement they have is changing things.  Obviously the friendship can never be the same, but moving full steam ahead into a relationship, as much as Shane may want that, is something Maggie faces with no small degree of trepidation.The characters were complex, and the story was a strong, fresh take on what would otherwise be a standard plot.  Schroeder manages to weave deep friendship, fun banter, and sad circumstances of the past together into a truly hopeful romance without glossing over the issues Maggie has to overcome.  It‚Äôs a tough subject to include and treat appropriately, and while it does get the happily ever after treatment (as anyone would hope when it comes to a romance novel) plenty of attention is paid to Maggie‚Äôs feelings and recovery (for lack of a better word).  Hold Me Close is easily one of the sweetest best-friends-to-more stories I‚Äôve read, and if Shane doesn‚Äôt steal your heart, there‚Äôs something very, very wrong with you.***FicCentral received this book from Kensington Books (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZN1EM2JL9CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7FBLS#wasThisHelpful","R37ZN1EM2JL9CV","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After serving time in prison and in the military, all for a crime he didn't commit, Seth has an awfully big chip on his shoulder.  But the girl he loved before everything went to hell has never left his heart ‚Äî no matter how much he tried to push her away.  He's back now, though, and he's determined to win her over again.  But Rowan isn't a starry-eyed sixteen-year-old anymore, and the walls Seth put up when he went to prison hurt her more than she's willing to admit.The Verdict: I knew going in that a major plot point was Seth having been convicted of a crime he didn't commit, but I had no idea how realistically it would play out.  Not necessarily the golden boy, he'd been illegally street racing, after which a fight broke out that quickly escalated to involve a gun.  It was a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with all the wrong circumstances working against him, and before he knew it, he was tossed into a cell to serve out a sentence for essentially having terrible luck.  But unlike what we usually see in romances with a similar plot twist, Seth's circumstances feel absolutely possible, like the kind of thing that happens to kids all the time, just victims of circumstance and a turn they didn't see coming.Seth's short sentence was contingent upon his enlisting in the military, so the minute he was released, he traded prison orange for camouflage and was sent off to boot camp and war.  Years have passed, and he's nearly done with his enlistment term when his grandmother dies, sending him home to plan a funeral and oversee whatever estate she's left behind.Rowan is the girl Seth fell in love with as a wild teen, but when he and her brother were sent away to serve time, he was consumed with anger, and much of it was directed at Rowan.  Ever faithful, she came to visit and sent him letters, but he quickly let her know that he wanted nothing to do with her, breaking her heart and leaving her feeling very much alone at the confusing age of sixteen.  Sad and senseless as it was, this was another part of the story that made perfect sense from the side of gritty realism.  The miscarriage of justice tends to breed anger and a sense of me-against-the-world, turning its victims against even those who would help them and darkly coloring their reactions to anything decent that's left.  Seth wasn't an angel, but he was a decent kid who got screwed by circumstance and the system, and he took it out on the one person he could ‚Äî the girl he loved.Seth's return to civilian life sets these two on a collision course that's filled with conflicting emotions and white-hot attraction.  Rowan's never been a shrinking violet, and when faced with the guy who turned on her and left her alone to find her way in a world where her boyfriend and brother were both in prison, she's not letting down her guard easily.  He may have been the one eaten alive by anger, but she's lived her damage, too, and she's not going to make things easy on him.  Watching these two navigate their new reality and the minefields that are left in their hearts makes for plenty of drama and emotion, and it was impossible to stop turning pages.  Marquita Valentine has created characters that are wonderfully flawed and complex and put them in a true-to-life situation that would test even the strongest hearts.  Finding their way through it and coming out on happily ever after side was an emotional but fun ride.Next up is her brother's story, pairing him up with prudish Piper, the only friend who stuck around when a teenage Rowan was separated from her brother and boyfriend, and I can tell you now that the November release date simply can't come soon enough!***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13PFWWG19YHSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1J5KU#wasThisHelpful","R13PFWWG19YHSG","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should come as no secret that I've read this one before, but it was a fun read and I was very curious to see how it translated into original fiction.  Savage's stories have generally only borrowed names and places in the fan fiction world, so it wasn't a surprise that this one bore zero resemblance to other published works.Liam is a cage fighter, not the kind you see on pay-per-view but the kind that is found in seedy bars, throwing punches and kicks for just enough cash to cover basic expenses.  He's no stranger to the decaying underbelly of society and vices along skid row, which is why he's surprised to notice a young and rather naive girl walking home alone through the worst streets at the worst time of night.  His penchant for violence and unrestrained anger quickly reveals itself when he finds her in danger, and though their initial meeting is a bit on the terrifying side, he soon finds himself playing hero and protector to the girl who is revealed as his downstairs neighbor.Tria is starting over, though it's obvious she never had much to begin with.  Having left behind the archaic expectations of her tiny hometown, she's out of her depths in the grungiest part of the city, but it's what she can afford, and it's close enough to the university that saw to her scholarship.  He upstairs neighbor is the last kind of person she would have seen herself spending time with, but as he comes to her rescue more and more, she can't help but see him as something more than the angry, purposeless fighter he first appears to be.Told from Liam's point of view, readers are left to draw their own conclusions about Tria's thoughts, but she appears to be rather guileless and uncomplicated. Their relationship is more than simple attraction, though they certainly have that in spades.  Tria seems to be almost completely unaffected by Liam, but it appears she's only enforcing boundaries on herself out of respect for him and the need to keep the only friend she seems to have in the city.  Liam, on the other hand, is beside himself with raw want, but Tria is young and innocent, relying on him to help her, not take advantage of her.Shay Savage pulls no punches when telling the story from Liam's side, making Caged: Takedown Teague a wickedly raw but simply romantic story that promises a sinfully rough road to an eventual happy ending.  Having been broken into three separate books, this piece of the story ends on a cliffhanger, which is why I can't bring myself to give it five stars.  While the next installment will be out within a month, there are few things that end a book for me on a more disappointing note than leaving everything up in the air.  Even having read it in its original form, I'm itching to know whether the coming chapters follow the path I remember.***FicCentral received this book from TRSOR Promotions for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRUPGKAEMA4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C3UFXQ#wasThisHelpful","RLRUPGKAEMA4L","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it only makes sense that the synopsis is usually what has me itching to read a particular book, it's certainly rare that I'm hooked by the very first sentence. My fianc√© is officially a married man. The only problem is that he isn't married to me. . . Seriously, who can pass that up?Addison has had some hard knocks. The boy she loved moved away and gradually faded away, despite the promise that he'd be back to marry her. Since then, her father has passed away, and she's found herself stuck in the small town where she grew up, and although she's a lawyer now, she's not climbing any ladders or living any dreams.The story starts off with Addison having just seen Matt for the first time in years, and while it initially seemed like a dream come true, the morning after reveals that he's married. It's not just the shock and betrayal you might expect; it also leaves her to question everything she's done since he left. Their relationship faded into nothing over time, much like long distance things tend to do. The phone calls became less frequent, eventually stopping altogether, but with every other wrong turn her life took, the idea of living happily ever after with Matt was something she had a hard time letting go.Damian is the guy who moves in next door. He's hot as all get out, but more than that, he seems to get her. He understands her humor and can see that she's still reeling from whatever's happened with her ex, and while it's obvious that she's more than just a little attracted to him, Damian isn't the type to do casual hook-ups. He's a relationship guy, the opposite of everything he saw his father do wrong, and he knows he has to give Addison time to move on and move forward with him.I loved their banter and the coffee mugs each morning, but Addison's mixed-up feelings over Matt also made perfect sense. The author did a wonderful job of putting readers in Addison's shoes, where even though it's obvious that Matt isn't the right guy for her, it's also really hard to walk away when it seems that everything she's ever wanted for her future is right there for the taking. In fact, as much as I hated Matt's deception and the way he abandoned her all those years ago, I actually felt a little sorry for him. It was obvious that while he made some truly terrible decisions and had the wrong priorities for so long, he really did have deep emotions when it came to Addison. Leaving her and marrying someone else for prestige and money was absolutely unforgivable, but I couldn't help but feel a little for the guy who wanted nothing more than to have his first love back. Damian's story was pretty heartbreaking as well when it was revealed why he was so hell-bent on taking care of the little girl in the hospital. That one managed to stay a mystery for much longer than we typically see in books, though I did finally guess the reason there toward the end.The one thing that really bugged me about Addison and Damian together, though, was how quickly they turned on each other at the slightest miscommunication. After a few times, you'd think they would realize that staying around an extra five seconds for an explanation was worth it, but they just kept running off and shutting each other out, only to beg forgiveness a short while later. Still, Right Next Door was a pretty pleasant surprise compared to most romances I read. The characters had depth and flaws that weren't just there so someone could think they were cute, and while they may have jumped into things early on, they struggled to make it through their problems as their relationship was building. The best part, though, was how it all came together in the end. Whereas many stories line up everything so perfectly that it's tied up with a big, bright bow, Right Next Door served up a happily ever after that made perfect sense and held to a more realistic resolution. If this is what I can expect from A.J. Pryor, I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!***FicCentral received this book from Inkslinger PR for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWI4DV5UXXOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7PRLKW#wasThisHelpful","R2EWI4DV5UXXOF","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jessie's life was never an easy one, but she was a good kid, and she had a best friend and crush in Dylan McBride. Dylan was everything that high school girls dream of, and while Jessie may have been from the wrong side of town, she's always held a special place in his heart. But it's been years, and no one's seen a trace of Jessie since the last beating she took from her father. Dylan's used all the tools law enforcement has placed at his disposal, but nothing's even pointed toward a body. Until the day her father dies, and Jessie returns from the unknown.But... As much as I felt for Jessie, I had a hard time connecting with her like I should have, and I think that's in large part to the disparities been teenage Jessie and grown up Jessie. She was supposedly hard as a kid, too, with a soft-spot for Dylan, but all I really saw of her in the prom flashback at the beginning was an enamored little girl who didn't fit in well socially. There was nothing there for me to see firsthand how strong she was inside. But grown up Jessie was all hard edges and boxed-up emotions, and while some of that made sense given both her career and what she'd been through, it didn't line up with the fifteen year old girl that was first introduced to us.Also, I'm not so sure about the age difference. Unless I missed something, Jessie was fifteen and Dylan was eighteen when they went to prom and had the requisite back-seat experience afterward. While that's not necessarily unheard of among high schoolers, the age of consent in the U.S. is at between sixteen and eighteen in all states, and while it may not be criminal for a fifteen year old and a sixteen year old to sleep together, the bigger the age difference, the higher the probability it surpasses legality in that jurisdiction. I don't know which state they're in, but Jessie's young age was enough for me to do a double-take, not to mention start wondering if the statute of limitations had passed by the time she came back or if Dylan had in fact broken the law. If it was illegal, that would certainly explain his mother's actions more reasonably‚Ä¶ Oh, but for those of you who might be creeped out, it wasn't explicit; it was simply said that it happened.The Verdict: Every second-chance romance has a sad story in the past, but this one just might be the saddest I've read. For all intents and purposes, Jessie and Dylan were just kids, and life pulled them apart ‚Äî at first simply the way life tends to do, and then later thanks to cruelty and awful luck.After returning from his stint in the military, Dylan's become the local sheriff, in part because he wants to help people who are being abused. He didn't realize until too late that Jessie's bruises weren't accidents or on-the-job mishaps, and by the time he did, she'd disappeared. For years the town has speculated that her father finally killed her, but there's never been any evidence one way or the other. She's just gone without a trace, and even with law enforcement databases and resources, Dylan hasn't been able to find any clue that she lived past the week after he left for the service. When Jessie's father dies, though, she suddenly shows back up in town, intent on burying the past and helping her brother before he's too far gone down the path her father took. He reappearance is a shock, to say the least, and it's the answer to Dylan's prayers.Time and survival mode has only made Jessie stronger and more closed off, though, and while she and Dylan may have history, she doesn't want to visit it for fear that remembering everything else will simply be too painful. I won't give it away, but Jessie's got a devastating secret that she can't quite bring herself to tell Dylan, and it's absolutely heart-breaking for him.While the age difference not being better explained away certainly bothered me, and I had a little trouble completely connecting with Jessie, the majority of the story played out perfectly. From Dylan's consistent attempts to win her back, to the men she'd come to think of as family, to Dylan's little boy pointing out the obvious (you'll see!), it's a great story. And while Dylan certainly did everything he could to show Jessie that he'd never leave again, she was smart enough to hold back her own feelings for much longer than I expected. It made sense, given what all she'd lost, but it also did well to avoid one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to romances ‚Äî everyone falling head over heels too fast. The pace of their relationship was slow, but perfectly so, and it made for a wonderful story of forgiving and falling in love again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZIQMPSMXFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR0CJ1K#wasThisHelpful","ROZIQMPSMXFK","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once a trouble-maker, Owen McBride is now a respected attorney in his small town, but he hasn't quite shed his bad boy reputation.  When coupled with his money and status, it's little wonder women practically throw themselves at him.  But no one's ever caught his eye long enough to have him considering a serious relationship ‚Äî at least not until Claire, his stand-offish but beautiful neighbor, is caught up in one of his client's drama.But...  While I certainly enjoyed the story, I was surprised to find several typos.  Normally, I probably would have overlooked them, but this wasn't an ARC; it was a purchase of the final version on Amazon more than a year after it was published, and it's Avon/Harlequin/Harper Collins.  With that kind of operation behind it, you'd think the editing would be spotless.  I can't say it really affected my reading, but it just seemed so weird to see this from one of the biggest publishing conglomerates there is.  Oh well‚Ä¶The Verdict:  While Owen may have been a secondary character in The Return of Brody McBride, he certainly made an impression.  The way he stepped in and took care of Rain when she was dealing with a double-dose of single motherhood was certainly admirable, but the way he did it with his whole heart had me loving him from the beginning.  So, of course, I was thrilled to get his story and watch him find his happily ever after.Claire has been in town for a while now, long enough to set up shop and establish her business, not to mention make some serious progress on renovating the old house she bought.  But after having been cheated on repeatedly by her slime of an ex, she's not looking to rush out and find a new romance.  But her quiet life takes a crazy turn the night a drunk man shows up at her house and attacks her in a very misguided, confused, and violent attempt to get revenge on his ex-wife and her lawyer.When Owen took Shannon, client who'd been abused by her husband, he tried to do the right thing and convince her that she deserved better, but while he certainly showed compassion while handling her divorce, he never even hinted at crossing any lines with her.  Her drunken, crazy ex has other ideas though, attacking Claire in the mistaken assumption that she's important to Owen.  That attack is what finally brings Owen and Claire together.  I have to say, though, that attack scared the hell out of me.  While Dale was more violent drunk than murdering rapist, it just goes to show how safety is an illusion.Owen and Claire's relationship moves at a decent pace, not so fast that it feels rushed, but not so slow that it's terribly frustrating.  Claire is understandably hesitant to get involved with anyone too quickly, and when it becomes clear that Shannon's also got her eye on Owen, it just adds a complication to their budding relationship that would have most women reluctant to move forward, and I loved seeing Claire's very realistic hesitation and questioning of things.The one real drawback, I think, was the not-so-surprising plot twist.  While it wasn't so entirely transparent that I figured it out in the first couple of chapters, by the time I did guess what was coming, I was shocked that the characters in the book were still blind to it.  Comments by Owen and the police about Dale's intelligence and typical transgressions made it a simple case of 2+2=4, but the characters were still coming up with 73.  I think I would have enjoyed the story quite a bit more if (A) we as readers had been left as much in the dark as the characters apparently were, or (B) the characters remained as intelligent as they initially appeared to be and figured out the obvious for themselves.Despite that annoyance, though, Falling for Owen remained an entertaining read.  There was plenty of drama, some good suspense and danger, and a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù one would not have expected early on.  Owen, of course, was as awesomely sweet as always, and Claire was smarter than your average romance novel heroine who rushes headlong into love.  Their romance was hot, sweet, and exactly what I look for in the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WI7VE00GK4I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3FRSI#wasThisHelpful","R1WI7VE00GK4I0","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time, Carolyn was the beautiful debutante who fell in love with the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, but their Romeo and Juliet romance came to an end when her father had him arrested.  But times have changed, and all the money that placed Carolyn's family on a golden pedestal has been squandered, leaving her in a mountain of her father's debt and working her fingers to the bone to keep them fed and clothed.  Her father's recent heart attack hasn't made things any easier, but she's excelling in her work at the country club where she once danced the night away.  But the past has come back to haunt her in the worst way now that the boy she once loved has returned as the club's new owner, intent on making big changes to keep things profitable.But... Overall, the story was great and not nearly as predictable as one might expect.  However, there was an additional point of view thrown in, presumably to introduce us more fully to a character who will be focused on in a subsequent book, and from a reader's perspective, it just didn't fit.  The chapters that told things from Jane's point of view had little to do with rekindling things between Carolyn and Jake, and rather than add to the story, they detracted from it.  While I liked Jane's character, her story should have been held aside for another book, and any important pieces could easily have been revealed in her interactions with Carolyn rather than detouring readers from the main plot for entire chapters.  I have no idea what took place during editing, but it seems saving these chapters for later would have been a no-brainer.The Verdict: It's been fifteen years since Carolyn and Jake last saw each other, and what a difference those years have made.  Carolyn's mother has passed away, and her father's health is in jeopardy, while she works long hours at the only job that will have her.  Once a member of the exclusive country club, she now referees employee spats and plans parties and events there, a far cry from the privileged life she once enjoyed.  Her family's wealth disappeared with her father's financial advisor, and Carolyn is for the most part completely on her own with no one else on whom to lean when things go wrong ‚Äî which they've been doing for years now.Jake's arrest back in the day didn't ruin his life, but it certainly gave him a new perspective.  Realizing he would never be good enough for the upper crust, he spent the years getting an education and working his way up in the business world.  Now a success, he's returned to Briarwood to prove his worth, and while he may never truly fit into the old money world, he's no one to be looked down upon anymore.I loved the initial reunion between Carolyn and Jake, proof that the years had changed them both and a reminder of the different worlds that pulled them apart.  But what surprised me most was Jake's reaction to Carolyn.  While he certainly still harbored some anger over the way things went down, he didn't hold it all against her, and he was quick to realize the financial predicament she was in.  He could have lorded his success over her and made her feel like a lesser person now that she was struggling just to keep the refrigerator filled, but instead he saw how hard she worked and didn't do anything to make things more difficult for her.Their relationship, once it was rekindled, was piping hot and filled with uncertainties, mostly because neither really seemed to know how to bridge the past and move fully into the present.  Carolyn had too much on her plate to become involved with her new boss, and Jake had plenty of resentment to overcome.  But rather than play completely into the romance novel cliches one might expect, Jake and Carolyn handled things a bit differently on their way to a new happily ever after, and that's what made it such an interesting read.  While the additional chapters from another character's point of view got it the way too often, the root of the story was a great one.  Second chance romances are always fun, given the established history between characters, and Once and Again did that well.  I suspect that the next book in the series will be all about Jane, and I'm definitely interested in finding out what's next in her story.***FicCentral received this book from Random House LLC (via NetGalley) for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZN695H3K1V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONUYEW8#wasThisHelpful","R2IZN695H3K1V8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emma's career as a reporter isn't exactly turning out the way she'd hoped, but she intends to use her time at the small-town newspaper as a stepping stone.  Having recently attended an underground fight club in the next town over, she wonders if her big break might be exposing one of the masked fighters as a highly respected citizen of the community, but in the meantime, she's stuck reporting who got arrested or ticketed over the week.Nick's been trying to lie low and not attract anyone's attention for so long that the citizens of Covendale hardly give him a second glance.  As a local deputy, the last thing he should be involved in is underground fighting, but it was the only way to get the money needed for his father's lifesaving surgery.  He hates every second of it, but winning those fights is paying off his debt to a dangerous loan shark, and his father is worth it all.Judging Covers:  Yep, my thoughts on this one are pretty much what they were on the previous two.  You have no idea how badly I want to design a whole new set of covers for this series.The Verdict:  Emma's not thrilled about Covendale, and her arrival is made worse by the fact that her furniture and belongings have been waylaid by incompetent movers.  She's not exactly impressed by her helpful neighbor either ‚Äî at least until she gets a better look at him.Nick and Emma are quickly paired up as part of their jobs, both surprised when they come face to face again.  And while Nick knows better than to get involved with a reporter, just the type of person who can blow his other identity wide open, he can't seem to stay away from her.  And Emma is quickly intrigued by the man who goes from practically no personality around others to witty and kind around her.  It's only a matter of time before she connects him with the fight ring she's investigating on the side.Normally, nosy reporter characters get on my nerves, but Emma's instinct to dig deeper didn't come at the expense of ethics.  She came across as smart and curious, but not the kind of person who would go after the story no matter who it hurt.  And of course I felt terrible for Nick, having to compromise his safety and integrity to provide for his father.  His mother's complete naivete and faith was cute as all get out, too.Of course, the fighting thing does eventually come to light, and while it's certainly dramatic, it doesn't all blow up the way I thought it would.  I don't want to give away the ending, but it played out quickly, with just the right amount of suspense and danger to keep things interesting.  I suppose the only thing I can really complain about is that it would have been nice to have more story, but considering how much I usually don't enjoys novellas and short books, Deputy's Secret is certainly a standout.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53POD4WW42AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVNZWK8#wasThisHelpful","R53POD4WW42AR","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were a lot of pieces to the plot of this one that should have made me hate it, but all together it actually made for an incredibly interesting read with an unexpected twist a rather standard trope.The break-up between Brody and Rain back in the day didn't make a lot of sense, but then again, plenty of break-ups never do.  And what happened directly afterward, as awful as it is, is actually pretty true to life.  The short of it is that Brody and Rain broke up, he had a one-night-stand with someone else, and then they got back together for a very brief moment before he headed off into the military.  So instead of coming home years later to a surprise kid, Brody came home to double the surprise.  As much as that initial detail pissed me off, it also had me wondering how it would all play out.It's impossible not to feel bad for Rain.  The guy she was in love with knocked her up and then took off for the wild blue yonder before either of them knew what was coming in nine months.  But worse, his one-night-stand also got pregnant, leaving Rain not only to deal with the small-town shame of being an unwed and essentially abandoned mother, but also having to deal with the whispers, looks, and gossip surrounding the fact that she wasn't the only one he left in that condition.  No matter what she did before or after, you've just gotta feel something for a woman in her shoes.Fast forward several years, and Brody is back in town, out of the military, and looking to reconnect with Rain.  Discovering what he'd left behind was the shock of a lifetime, but how Rain handled it all was incredibly admirable.  She'd held her head up, raised her daughter, and even informally adopted his other daughter from a truly unfit mother.  What follows, of course, is Brody's desperate attempt to make up for the wrongs he's done, not to mention some unwelcome drama from Baby Mama #2.It should have been hard for me to accept a story about a heroine abandoned while pregnant, the town whore also pregnant by hero at the same time, and all the drama said whore put on the table upon the hero's return, but somehow all this combined just reeled me in.  I think part of it is simply that the plot was rather unique without making a mockery of everything, and part of it is just Jennifer Ryan's writing.  While I was angry and judgmental and betrayed right alongside Rain, it was also very clear that Brody had simply made a very stupid (and not uncommon) mistake and was willing to do anything necessary to make up for it as much as possible, and he never pulled the custody card to get what he wanted.  In the end, what should have been an overly dramatic mess of a story turned out to be thoroughly entertaining and unique, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for a different kind of second chance romance story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RX027DMNYL3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3FRS8#wasThisHelpful","R3RX027DMNYL3M","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luka's never really gotten over Reese, her first love.  Back in high school, they went on a few dates, but then he abruptly ended things and enlisted in the military.  Plenty of years have passed since then, but while the memories are more bitter than sweet, Luka's heart still skips a beat when she runs into him again.Reese has always cared about Luka, and while he wanted to see more of her back in high school, his brutal father's threats brought that young relationship to an end and sent him packing off to war.  Now his dad's stowed away in a VA hospital, and Reese's military service is over, but he's still not quite ready to face his first love.Judging Covers:  Well, the visual theme is consistent, but it's still pretty generic and spells lust more than romance.  The series itself is pretty fun, and it's definitely filled with romance, so I guess I just wish the covers were nicer and reflected that better.The Verdict:  The relationship between these two was sad and sweet.  It was clear how much they cared about and wanted each other, but as teenagers, they couldn't call the shots, and as adults, they've both been dealt some hardships and are wary of chasing the dream.  Their present story started out in an interesting way ‚Äî detailing the end of the previous book from the perspective of two characters previously mentioned but not focused on. The time was the same, but the importance of events was very different, showing what was going on in Luka's life as Sydney's new relationship was solidifying in the background. It sounds like it should have been boringly repetitive, but because Luka and Sydney were experiencing such different things at the moment, it was actually very interesting to see some of the same time pass by in this way.Luka seems to live a rather unextraordinary small-town life.  She works at the local salon and shares a home with her three rowdy brothers.  It's clear the siblings share an incredibly close relationship, something that is explained more clearly in subsequent books.  But Luka's not had any real luck in love, and when she spots Reese in town, she can't help but want to spend some time with him, even though he broke her heart with virtually no explanation years ago.Reese saw plenty of ugliness in the world long before he ever saw a battlefield.  His abusive father made his life hell, but Reese managed to keep his head above water until being all but forced to join the military.  Now he struggling with his memories of the war along with his fear of genetics ‚Äî specifically his fear that he will somehow become his father.  He already has rage issues, incidents that resemble blackouts, and he doesn't want to inflict that life on Luka.Luka and Reese take their relationship at warp speed, but that just means they falter and have to face the consequences of never really taking things out before.  Reese can't resist her but is determined that they remain friends, while Luka can't say no to him and feels herself losing her heart along the way.  They're both so lost, with Reese afraid of allowing himself to be in a relationship and Luka getting her heart broken every time he calls her a friend.  I'm not sure I ever completely understood Reese's certainty that he was destined to be the cruel bastard that his father was, but I certainly understood Luka's inability to protect her heart from him.Like the previous book in the series, this one is short, which meant getting to the eventual happy ending wasn't dragged out by unnecessary drama, but it also meant that just as soon as they hit a good point, it was over.  I should also note that (having read all the others in the series by now), condoms don't make an appearance in these books.  Normally, it wouldn't even stand out to me, but for characters who meet, quickly make it to the bedroom, and then live happily ever after in the span of just over a hundred pages, especially when those characters don't discuss history or health or even know all that much about each others' pasts, it screamed risk.  In any case, Soldier's Choice was a great read with plenty of interesting characters and lots of steamy romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEYYJZIN3XHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVNYLA0#wasThisHelpful","R2BEYYJZIN3XHX","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Isaac ‚ÄúIce‚Äù Wolfe is as cold as his nickname implies, but his bad attitude has led to what very well be his last trade in the NHL.  The Seattle Sockeyes are taking a chance on the player no other team wants, and if he doesn't make a change, he'll be off the ice in no time.Avery Maxwell is finally pursuing dreams of her own.  Terribly neglected by her parents, she followed her sisters in making sure they had roof over their heads and food on the table.  But now that she finally has the chance to do what she's always dreamed of ‚Äî train and show horses ‚Äî she's abandoned her college education and the future her sisters had planned for her, and is putting her heart into the one job she's always wanted.  But the handsome and bitter man next door soon has her adding to the list of things she wants for herself.Judging Covers:  I'm still trying to figure out why this one is pink when the other books in the series have been blue, but that doesn't mean I don't like it.  The guy doesn't look quite as capable of a scowl as I would have expected, but I still think the couple fits, and they're definitely more on the attractive side than some of the previous cover couples for this series.The Verdict: We didn't get to know Avery very well in the previous books, though we saw her quite a bit and watched her relationship with her sisters hit a rough patch when she decided to leave school and make her living working with horses instead.  So I was definitely looking forward to this closer look into her life and personality.Isaac, or ‚ÄúIce‚Äù as he's known in the league, seems to have spent his life burning bridges.  Rather than be a team player, he's used his hockey skills o prove his own worth on the ice, and he hasn't limited that attitude to his time on the ice.  Reporters, fans, teammates, and coaches have all been subjected to his refusal to play nice for appearances' sake, and it's gotten so bad that every other team has washed their hands of him.  But his trade to the Sockeyes is just the wake up he needs, finally seeing for himself that if he stays on the same bitter path, he'll find himself a has-been in no time, not because he's not good at the game, but because he's not good at everything around the game.  Watching him come to grips with his own shortcomings and work to change his ways made for a very interesting bit of character development.Avery is Isaac's neighbor, spending her days working with horses and attending to damaged hearts, and she doesn't have room in her life for a man who wears a permanent scowl.  But as their attraction heats up and Isaac's past is slowly revealed, it becomes apparent that he needs just as much love as anyone else who's been scarred.  As Avery gets to know him better, though, she's also got to remain focused on her work as a horse trainer, hoping to make her mark in an incredibly competitive field, and their budding relationship is bound to create waves for Isaac as well, since Avery's sister is engaged to his team captain.Avery and Isaac both have pretty sad backstories, though Isaac's certainly takes the cake when it comes to tragedy and self-blame, but between their fiery spirits and Avery's big heart, they really do make the perfect couple.  It would have been easy to rush the plot around them and add all kinds of unnecessary drama, but instead it played out at the perfect pace, focusing on Isaac's learning to accept the past and forgive himself and Avery's finally taking ahold of what she wants.  I've certainly enjoyed the other books in the Game on in Seattle series, but I think this one just might be my favorite yet.***FicCentral received this book from Tasty Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YJ8EVSSXBNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLZEIAW#wasThisHelpful","R19YJ8EVSSXBNB","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this one, but the more I read, the more it fell apart.  I kept reading for a lot longer than I should have, I think, hoping that something would sway me toward the positive, but I finally just bailed at around 85%.Shamrocks and Secrets is the story of Christi, a woman of Irish descent being pursued by and eventually falling in love with Patrick, a powerful Irish Mob boss.  However, it's overly romanticized and underdeveloped, and it could have used a couple more editors before going to print.Initially, Christi irritated me with her references to Patrick being in the Mafia instead of the Mob.  Yes, Americans more familiar with the Gambinos than the Westies tend to apply Mafia to everything organized crime, but I would have expected a woman of Irish descent to differentiate ‚Äî or at least for someone in Patrick's family to mention the favored terminology.  And I believe Christi was meant to be strong and independent, generally unswayed by Patrick's wealth and power, but after a strong start, she began to lack depth and ended up being more of a two-dimensional representation of those traits.  A few of her actions contradicted Patrick, but mostly she allowed herself to be controlled by him, such as when she attempted to leave their first date but ended up being driven back to his penthouse without so much as a grumble to the contrary.  Her primary issue with him was her assumption that all men involved in organized crime are unfaithful, as if that's the most dangerous thing about becoming involved with a member of the Mob.  Sure, she wasn't thrilled about the criminal side of things, either, but the frequency with which she brought up his apparent need to have numerous affairs made his illegal activity seem like an afterthought.Patrick's character was just as thin and strangely stereotypical.  Rather than work at getting to know her, he started in with expensive and over-the-top displays of his wealth and power immediately upon informally meeting her.  While it was later explained that he had known about her for years and simply waited patiently until a time when she was more mature and less naive to begin pursuing her, his staking his claim on her and attempting to woo her with gifts was just too much and too soon to be believed.  Christi rather weakly resisted for only a short while before putting aside her principles, and it felt like much of that development was skipped in order to get to the next scene more quickly.I also quickly became annoyed with the editing issues.  Terms of endearment and polite addresses were capitalized, as if Patrick had been knighted by the Queen herself, and for every properly placed semicolon, it seemed there was another sentence in which a comma was incorrectly used instead.  To the author's credit, many of the mistakes I noticed were the kind that most people wouldn't catch, but any good editor would have noticed them right away.  At the very least, someone with a few extra English classes under the belt would have saved that poor, abused apostrophe from pluralized surnames.The general flow of the story was pretty inconsistent as well, and it was difficult to tell whether the time between scenes and events was just a few hours or as long as a few weeks.  As a result, the plot felt rushed, as if much of getting to the relationship between Christi and Patrick had happened behind the scenes, and we readers were only getting the Cliff Notes version.  The pace felt a lot more like a serial, much like single chapters are posted in fanfiction stories, rather than a standard novel, and I have to admit that as soon as Patrick's eyes and hair were described, I had visions of Twilight all-human fanfic.  (EDIT:  Just went to grab the cover from Goodreads, and the very first review said this one used to be fanfic.  I need to start paying attention to these things before I buy.  At least then I'd be able to narrow selections to only those authors whose work I know I previously enjoyed, rather than offend someone I probably know.)I do think the story idea was good, and it had the potential to be very entertaining, even if it strayed from gritty realism.  The cover certainly caught my eye, and the synopsis made it sound like a really fun read.  But while it fell flat for me, I suspect with some generous substantive and copyediting, it could have been a wonderful story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJQBDOL7UHQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502455277#wasThisHelpful","ROJQBDOL7UHQA","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sidney's still carrying around the pain of being laughed at and humiliated by Cam when he was the high school it-boy and she was the overlooked junior.  Now that she's getting married to the mayor's son, though, she trying to plan the perfect wedding.  And it won't be perfect without a horse-drawn carriage, but the only one in town is owned by none other than the guy she'd rather forget.Judging Covers: I can't say I'm a fan of this one.  It's a little on the kitschy side, if you ask me, and I almost passed it up, immediately assuming it was just another one of the all too prevalent badly written and rushed to publish novellas that plague Amazon.  But since I was in the mood for something countrified, I gave the synopsis a read and figured at the very least, I could bail if it sucked.  Which it didn't.The Verdict:  When I sit down and try to describe this one, I find myself listing out a bunch of romance novel cliches, but it didn't feel that way at all when I was reading Sydney and Cam's story.Sydney had the biggest crush on Cam when she was younger, but he laughed in her face the one time she asked him out, and she's avoided him ever since.  Fortunately, he's not difficult to dodge, since he's practically turned into a hermit in the years since then.  The popularity he enjoyed when they were young has long since passed, and it seems he now has a reputation as the town's angry loner, eager to fight or maybe even shoot.Cam hasn't had it easy, and that's putting it lightly.  His father died toward the end of his senior year, and life hasn't been the same since.  The additional hardships he's faced are the kind that would have destroyed a lesser man, but he's endured, even if it meant relying on no one but himself.  At first he's just about impossible to like, even though there's something definitely intriguing about him.  But when his full story comes out, his behavior is not only understandable but practically justified.The relationship between these two moves pretty quickly, in part because at 182 pages, Cowboy's Pride is about half the length of your standard romance novel.  But it's also nice to read a story in which the characters don't go back and forth for an interminable length of time before finally coming to their senses and working things out.  That's not to say there's no drama ‚Äî it's quite the opposite, in fact ‚Äî but it moves at a swift pace, so there's no chance to get bored.The only real drawback, I would say, is that when it does comes to an end, it wraps up and is done before you even realize it.  Just a few more pages, a little more insight into the future, would have made a big difference.  Still, it's a really fun, sweet read, and while it's only the first of several in the series, it's part of the Kindle Unlimited program, making it super-affordable to read them all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSFP8YJ0OSAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVO0QAI#wasThisHelpful","R1DSFP8YJ0OSAA","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Summer's music career hits the skids thanks to a cheating boyfriend/bandmate and a lecherous music executive, she just wants to leave it all behind. The house and restaurant she inherited from her grandfather is the perfect excuse to leave California behind and get some perspective, maybe a new start.Gage had hoped the restaurant would be his ticket out of dangerous logging work, but he doesn't get his chance when the late owner's granddaughter shows up and tries to turn around the slow business. But he's betting that the California girl won't make it through the harsh Montana winter, so he's biding his time. Except she seems determined to stay, he can't keep his eyes off her, and it looks like they're going to be neighbors. He knows better than to fall for a woman who won't stick around, but try telling that to his heart‚Ä¶But... It's not ""here, here;"" it's ""hear, hear."" Has been since at least the 1700s. While a little irritating, that one mistake certainly doesn't make the story unreadable. I'm just not sure I can wrap my head around how the editor managed to get pretty much everything else perfect but didn't know basic etymology. Or have Google. Moving on‚Ä¶The Verdict: When I first spotted this book, I almost skimmed right past it. But I recognized the author's name, so I took a second to read the synopsis. And‚Ä¶ well, the words logging, Montana, and ranch were enough to pique my interest. It was free for a few days on Amazon, so I snapped it up and got to reading.Summer's pretty easy to like. While she's definitely led a different life in California from the one she's now attempting to make in Montana, she's not quite the fish out of water one might expect. She knows it will be difficult, completely different from anything she's ever known, but she doesn't have some impossible image of how things will be. She's willing to get her hands dirty and ask questions and learn whatever she needs to. Her music is important to her, but nailing down a recording contract was less about her and more about what she was supposed to do. Even though she wasn't necessarily prepared for life in Montana, she's not easily scared off, and she's willing to work for it.Gage was a bit difficult for me to understand at first. He was burned by a girlfriend back in the day, and now he uses his looks to have some no-strings-attached fun. But while he makes no apologies for it, he's not the selfish womanizer I thought he'd be. He's immediately intrigued by Summer, and despite their awkward first meeting, he doesn't hesitate to help her when her car runs out of gas. It doesn't hurt, of course, that he's pretty much the perfect male specimen, either.But it was when Summer and Gage were around each other that the real awesomeness happened. They were like night and day in some ways, and yet they got along well, even before the flirting began. Summer's banter with Gage (and his response) even before she really knew him made it clear these two were perfect for each other.‚ÄúThought you might be a bear.‚Äù‚ÄúDriving a truck?‚Äù‚ÄúI don't know. It's Montana. I thought maybe your bears were a little more acclimated to living up here, and trucks do seem to be the main mode of transportation.‚Äù‚ÄúNah, most of the bears prefer motorcycles. Makes them look tougher.‚ÄùOn the romance side of things, Summer and Gage had pretty incredible chemistry, but they also just had a lot of fun with each other. Gage may not have been a one-woman kind of man for many years, but he wasn't terrified of the prospect and threw himself head-first into things with Summer. And Summer, who'd been screwed over romantically and professionally prior to moving to Montana, ate up the attention. Basically instead of making their relationship an angst fest, Tess Oliver made it fun and realistic, and though I suspected I would like the book, I really kinda loved it.My problem now is what to do about the series. With as much as I loved Gage, do I really want to risk reading an MC romance? When it comes to billionaires, motorcycle clubs, anything bondage, and organized crime, there's a pretty good chance I'll hate it. And the dude in the next book is MC. Yeah, I want to know what's next, but I don't want to ruin the series for myself.

"Pepper's gearing up for what she hopes will be her best cross country season, even if it also happens to be just another year that she's hopelessly crushing on her best friend.  She's not at the bottom of the school hierarchy, but she knows she's not the kind of girl to get a guy like Jace, so she'll settle on staying his friend.  But the new guy, an avid runner like her, isn't hard on the eyes, either, and he's showing some interest.  Running may be her life, but it's time she got what her heart wants as well.The Verdict:  So far, this is a three-book series, though a fourth is currently in the works.  And so far, it's pretty awesome.Pepper is your average high school student in every way except athletics, where she excels in cross country and performs well in track.  She lives with her grandmother (who is all kinds of cool!) and practically grew up with her best friend Jace.  But Jace is the hottest thing in school, quarterback of the football team, and seems to exist in a whole different dimension from Pepper.  They're definitely close, but he looks at her like family, and she‚Ä¶ Well, she looks at him pretty much like every other girl in school does ‚Äî with stars in her eyes.Jace has some issues, though, or at least that's what it looks like.  Aside from being too cocky, a bit of a fighter, and always hopping from bed to bed, it seems that there's a lot about him that Pepper doesn't know.  He parties constantly, seems to have collected some shady friends, and keeps quite a bit of himself away from Pepper in the form of vague answers.Ryan is the new guy, dedicated to cross country like Pepper is, and not bad to look at, either.  He's considerate, mature for his age, and most definitely interested in Pepper.  I have to admit that I was torn between wanting Pepper to give up on Jace and choose nice guy Ryan, and wanting her to throw Ryan aside and nab Jace.  The triangle was nice, though, playing out well and again pretty true to real life.At its heart, Pepped Up is a romance standard, the story of the less popular girl pining over the incredibly popular and good-looking best friend.  But it's also the story of a girl growing up, facing some challenges, and pushing herself as a somewhat elite athlete.  It's hard to say what's so great about it, since it's just one of those intangible things you discover when reading it.  The writing is practically perfect, and the storytelling is spot on for the life of a teenager.Much of their school life is oddly absent, as the story focuses on Pepper's cross country training and competing, and the outside-of-school antics of her and her social circle.  There's the stereotypical mean girl, of course, but I don't think that's necessarily a negative.  Anyone who's ever been to high school knows there are always a handful of girls who think and act like they are better than all the rest, so while it may be a cliche, it's certainly founded in reality.I'm a huge fan of YA, but often I find that the characters either act like brainless brats or like they've got the wisdom of a 50-year-old, so when I find a story like Pepped Up, it really stands out.  Pepper is mature, but not too much so for her age, and while she's certainly a bit obsessed with Jace, she's also incredibly dedicated to running.  I thought that part would be terribly boring, especially as her runs and competitions were explained in such detail, but since it didn't bore a couch potato like me, that's saying something.  Then again, my brother made State in cross country, so perhaps I'm a little biased‚Ä¶ even if I do think anything that requires that much movement is a form of torture.  But without a doubt, Pepped Up is a must-read for YA romance fans, and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.***FicCentral received this book from Xpresso Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDJTQN7BCAP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES4N3ZI#wasThisHelpful","RVDJTQN7BCAP8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The baby sister of his best friend, Jewel was always too young for Nate, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from falling in love with her.  But then he and Rick headed off to war, and when the bullets stopped flying, only Nate was left.  He‚Äôs avoided Rick‚Äôs family for the past couple of years, but when he sees Jewel again, he‚Äôs faced with both his love for her and his guilt over having send Rick on the mission that killed him.The Verdict:  Well, in case the five star rating was too subtle, I loved it! I kept thinking I knew what was coming, but as usual, Melissa Foster took a classic romance plot and twisted it up a bit to have me turning pages as fast as I could!I love romances between characters who already have history, whether it‚Äôs friendship or school or just common links that don‚Äôt have them meeting as complete strangers.  I think it‚Äôs that they can be themselves a little more, not deal with the usual getting-to-know-you drama.  And of course it doesn‚Äôt hurt that they already care about each other.Jewel really seemed to have everything together, even though she was clearly stretching herself too thin in trying to work and also help her mother with her younger siblings.  But all her responsibilities kept her from having much of a life for herself, and even if she‚Äôd had the opportunity, her heart was still tied up in Nate, the guy who‚Äôd been her late brother‚Äôs best friend and who‚Äôd set her on fire with an unexpected kiss one New Year‚Äôs Eve.  Nate, on the other hand, was riddled with guilt over his role in Rick‚Äôs death.  Having been the one to send Rick on the supply run that resulted in his death, robbing him of his best friend, miring him in guilt, and making it difficult to face Rick‚Äôs family.I think what I loved most was how forthcoming Jewel was.  She tried to tamp down her feelings for Nate, thinking that he really only looked at her like a sibling, but when that proved to be impossible, she just went for it.  And even when Nate was running hot and cold, she just put it all out there and took a shot at landing the man she loved.  And Nate, despite his hesitation, didn‚Äôt really make a secret of his feelings, either ‚Äî at least not once it was clear that she wanted him.  Granted, he still had some things to work through, and he felt a bit like he was maybe taking advantage of her, but both characters were pretty clear when it came to expressing their emotions.What really surprised me, though, was when it came out that Jewel‚Äôs sense of responsibility to her family wasn‚Äôt simply selfless service but more rooted in fear of losing anyone else.  Having lost her father and older brother, she played Mother Hen to protect what was left of them.  Watching Jewel and Nate both navigate their own issues from loss was intense but rewarding, and had they not been such open people, they never would have made it.So yeah, once again, Melissa Foster has written the perfect romance.  Strong friendship, deep emotions, and of course plenty of chemistry.  I‚Äôve said it before, but I‚Äôll say it again‚Ä¶ Grab the whole Bradens series and get comfortable.  It‚Äôs an awesome ride.***FicCentral received this book from Brook Cottage Books for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XA1UAUE8SXT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYD7J7K#wasThisHelpful","R2XA1UAUE8SXT8","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caleb is facing a low point in his career, putting too much pressure on himself to take care of his family.  His past is something he‚Äôd love to leave in the past, but it keeps showing up again in the form of his ex-con father.  Sadie‚Äôs just trying to fly under the radar and salvage what she can of her reputation.  They‚Äôre not all that impressed with each other when they first meet, but a tentative friendship is born, and before either of them see it coming, their feelings cross into something more serious.Sadie‚Äôs situation is sad and unfortunately not all that uncommon.  Her ex-boyfriend, mad at her for having broken up with him, took to slut-shaming her by posting intimate pictures of her online and emailing around an embarrassing video.  Whether she‚Äôs done anything wrong or not (in this case not) it seems that everyone has turned against her.  Even finding a job was next to impossible until the mayor hired her as a favor to Sadie‚Äôs mother.  The local minor league baseball team on which Caleb plays has a past and reputation of their own, and Sadie is tasked with helping them clean up their image ‚Äî but Caleb‚Äôs simply too hard to resist of course.While their friendship made sense to me as it grew, I never completely felt the connection between Caleb and Sadie.  Fortunately, their individual stories were so interesting that I couldn‚Äôt help but keep reading.  I was most impressed by the fact that Sadie, while still labeled and shamed by the locals, has enough confidence and self-worth to stand up and eventually go after what she truly wants with Caleb.  There was lots of not-so-platonic banter early in their friendship, and it carried over into their more serious relationship as it grew.  The fact that while they both initially resisted, they soon gave in and didn‚Äôt care what the town thought, just made them both that much more likable in my eyes.All of Me is a bit different than your standard romance novel, though it follows the same general formula.  What makes it stand out are the characters themselves, each dealing with very realistic and believable problems, even as their relationship together grows.  Sadie‚Äôs a bit of a spitfire, and Caleb is incredibly generous in the way he puts his family first.  If you love a good love story and really appreciate characters who don‚Äôt fall for every contrived bit of drama thrown their way, this one is definitely the book for you.***FicCentral received this book from Harper Collins (via Edelweiss) for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GVGHWPRQRGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062372165#wasThisHelpful","R22GVGHWPRQRGB","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah's perfectly content living her quiet, uneventful life, so she isn't at all prepared when a stranger moves into the house next door and into her everyday existence.  When her mother starts inviting him to parties and church, it's even worse, in part because Sarah's so intrigued by him.  But the man with the guitar is unlike anyone she's ever met, and as much as she wants things to stay the way they've always been, there's no denying how she feels when she's around him.But...  While the story was pretty much amazing, the Kindle format was a mess.  All the chapter titles, along with some seemingly random sentences throughout the book, were arranged vertically, which meant page after page of trying to figure out where one word ended and the next one began.  Or just skipping that part and hoping it wasn't anything important.I deleted my copy and redownloaded from Amazon, but the problem remained, even when I switched to the Kindle for PC app.  Oddly enough, it did not have any problems on the Kindle Cloud Reader, so it seems there is some discrepancy in the way the different Kindle apps and devices display things.  Perhaps we'll have better luck when/if this title is released through other retailers, and we're not stuck with only the Kindle option.Judging Covers:  I can't seem to word this part without sounding awful, but suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of this cover.  It's just‚Ä¶ It looks like an early attempt by someone who hasn't quite built up their design skills, and while we've all been there, it sucks that such a great story doesn't have a better cover.  I think it's the lighting issue, the shadows not appearing where they should, making it look pasted together despite the clean cuts.  I was really surprised to find that it'd been done by a book cover designer, not just some friend with the best of intentions.The Verdict:  I never read this one in its fanfic form, so I had no idea what to expect going in.  To be honest, I was a little thrown by the title, but I figured it was worth a shot.  And it soooooooooo was.Sarah's more than just a homebody; she's a trauma or two away from being agoraphobic, and while the story simply presents her as she is, it later becomes clear that there's a reason she's never really branched out.  At the far end of her 20s, she's still living at home with her mother, in part because she doesn't necessarily equate independence with moving out on her own, but mostly because someone has to pay the bills.  Her mother, though employed, could never be called ambitious, and in fact seems to have a bit of Peter Pan syndrome going on.  Actually, now that I think about it, their quiet little street is a bit of a study in psychiatric concerns, but that just made it all that much more interesting.Spencer is the man who moves in next door, disrupting Sarah's introverted little world.  He's too old for her and too young for her mother, at least by some people's estimations, but that doesn't stop him from catching both their attention.  Sarah's mostly just curious and cautious, but Spencer won't let her brush him off.  His silly ways of getting and keeping her attention are cute as all get out, and when it's obvious she's a bit on the shy and flighty side, he's incredibly open and patient with her.  Sarah's juvenile mother, on the other hand, clearly has eyes for Spencer, doing whatever she can to catch his attention without truly crossing any lines. Sarah is generally mortified by her mother's behavior, but Spencer just seems to let it slide.Their story sounds like your typical romance.  The guy moves in, the girl notices, they spend time together, and it turns into something so much sweeter.  But it's also a coming of age story, late as Sarah may be to the game, and a study in friendship and relationships in general.  The secondary characters, all eccentric neighbors on their street, provide lots of questions and laughs throughout, and as time goes by and things change, Sarah begins to take those first few steps to really growing up.  That's not to say she's immature by any means; she's just missed out on some standard life experiences and holed herself up in the bubble that is her street.There's something about the style of writing that I can't explain but certainly bears mentioning.  It's not your run-of-the-mill storytelling, not just a run down of everything that's happening.  In Me and Mom Fall for Spencer, the smallest details of everyday life are part of the brilliance, a real and gritty look at simply existing.  From Sarah's utilitarian underwear to Spencer's ridiculous songs, I was more and more hooked with every page I turned.  I loved Sarah's way of observing the world around her, her fierce individuality and refusal to pretend to be anything different than she truly was inside.  And I loved the way Spencer simply gravitated to her and patiently waited for her to come around.Me and Mom Fall for Spencer is not the simplistic romance the title hints at; it's captivating and different and the kind of story that sticks with you long after you've hit the dreaded End.  If you're looking for something more than just another romance, Diane Munier certainly knows how to deliver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GGL2XQPLO7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4GQYGE#wasThisHelpful","R9GGL2XQPLO7J","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was afraid of this...  As with the previous ""boxed set"" from this series that I purchased, there's no table of contents.  Such a small thing that makes a HUGE difference when navigating 5 books all smashed together on a Kindle.  Sure, there's a list at the front of the included stories, but there's no way to easily get to them unless you feel like paging through half the massive book or just magically know which location a story begins at.  So of course, there's also no simple way to move between chapters if you want to skip back to look at something.  The price might be great compared to buying them all separately, but the formatting screams of laziness and a rush to make money by suckering readers into something that's impossible to easily navigate.  The stories are great, but unless I luck into some freebies, I doubt I'll bother with the next books in the series.  It just doesn't seem worth the money or effort when there are hundreds of other authors whose published collections are formatted with readers in mind.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNRST7EEYAMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSR8TH2#wasThisHelpful","RHNRST7EEYAMY","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Linda's weight has been a struggle for years, but when her husband walks out on her because of it, her confidence is destroyed.  Determined to take control of her appearance, she's off to find a personal trainer who can whip her into shape.  Only she wasn't counting on one so young and attractive and impossible to resist, and he wasn't counting on falling for a client‚Ä¶But...  Even so and still as adverbs modifying comparatives mean the same damned thing, so why do people insist on cobbling them together into even still?  And why didn't an editor catch the seven times it appeared in this book?  *Sigh* I suppose I should just be happy that irregardless and overexaggerate didn't make an appearance‚Ä¶Judging Covers:  I'm not sure the cover image really sells this one as a romance, but I still think it's gorgeous and different, and unlike many books that claim to have an overweight character despite the skinny model on the cover, this one actually makes sense.The Verdict:  I don't really know how I ran across this one on Amazon, since I no longer keep an eye on the whole pulled-to-publish trend, but when I recognized it as one of my favorite fanfics, I figured I'd give the new version a shot.Linda's an easy character to get behind, and while she is certainly unhealthily obsessed with her weight, it's perfectly understandable, given that her weight seems to have been the primary factor in her marriage failing.  She's determined to do something about it, though, so she heads off to her personal version of hell ‚Äî the gym. Jack's easy to like as well, and his patience and understanding with Linda is touching.  He may never have had the struggles that she is going through, but he can see how devastating it's been for her, and he quickly forms a bond with her that goes beyond the usual trainer-client relationship.Watching Linda struggle with her self-image was rather painful at times, and I so often wanted to shake her and make her take an unbiased look in the mirror.  But I also know that's pretty realistic, that once a woman gets it in her head that she's overweight, getting her to stop being so critical of herself is next to impossible.  It's almost as if having that thing to blame and fix is necessary for focusing and excusing other problem areas in life.Unfortunately, the story didn't really have the same impact on me this time around, and I can't figure out why that is.  I absolutely loved it before, and I've thoroughly enjoyed plenty of used-to-be-fanfic books over the past year or so, so why did this one fall a little flat?  The story is virtually unchanged, save for the usual new character names, and nothing of the plot I loved before is missing.  I suppose it could be that Let's Get Physical simply stood out in quality against other fanfiction stories but is on a more level playing field in the published book world.  Or maybe my memory of it has changed over time.  It's still a sweet story, and I wouldn't say anything about it is lacking.  I just wasn't blown away by it as I've been with other former fanfiction stories.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FAHZPOUD38E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNQG6OK#wasThisHelpful","R12FAHZPOUD38E","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liva's life goes from hum drum to crazy in the space of just a few hours.  When the couple she's staying with are murdered just a room or two away from her, she's taken into protective custody and questioned by the police in the hope that something she saw or heard can lead them to the killers.  But when all hell breaks out in the police station, she finds herself running for her life with a boy who may or may not be in a gang, with no clue who she should trust or turn to, and no idea why someone so clearly wants her dead.Judging Covers: Okay, I'll admit it.  I only gave this one a shot because of the cover. Something about it stood out among the rows and rows of other books, and once I read the synopsis, it seemed like it just might be a great read.  I love the almost lack of color, the action-blurred title text, and the energy of the image itself.  When it comes to properly illustrating a story, it doesn't get much better than this cover.The Verdict: It's been a long, long time since I was so quickly sucked into a book and hanging on every word like I was with Out of Control.  One minute I was sort of bored and listless right alongside Liva, and then the next minute was pure chaos that didn't let up until the very end.The story begins in the police station, where Liva is being questioned about the murders of her father's friends, an older couple with whom Liva was staying while her father is out of town.  At seventeen, Liva is not as independent as one might expect, having spent much of her life overseas and in privileged but very controlled settings.  She's become accustomed to having bodyguards, and after one tragic circumstance in which she disobeyed, she's done her best to be the perfect, obedient daughter.It's at the police station that she meets Jay, a boy around her age who's been brought in wearing handcuffs.  She's curious but wary, and it seems she's still a bit in shock after the murders earlier in the evening.  But when gunfire erupts inside the station, she follows Jay's prompting, uncuffs him, and makes a run for it with him.  In that sense, she saves his life as much as he saves hers.I was a bit put off when she initially dismissed Jay as a gang member due to nothing more than a bandana hanging from his back pocket.  Then again, I don't know enough of gang culture to know if this is a real flag or simply something overdone by movies and the media.  It seems to me that plenty of people would have reason to carry a bandana ‚Äî from mechanics to construction workers to actual gang members.  But I suppose I can forgive her rush to judgement given that (a) she's been ridiculously sheltered her whole life and therefore probably has all kind of wrong ideas, and (b) the dude is handcuffed in the homicide investigations area.Liva was easy for me to relate to simply because she was such a fish out of water.  While I may know nothing of living overseas, trying to ditch bodyguards, or fancy apartments on the Upper East Side, I think anyone can relate to being in a situation that's completely foreign to them.  Her first instinct, despite her initial reaction to Jay, is to trust, but it seems that's quickly tempered by second-guessing and wondering if she should be expecting the worst ‚Äî something her father no doubt instilled in her.  She's also much more observant and careful than many of the damsels in distress we meet in novels, recognizing something is wrong even when she can't quite figure out where the danger is coming from.  She's had some self-defense training, and her time spent in dance has made her very physically fit and graceful, something that comes in handy when shimmying up to rooftops and running from the bad guys.  However, she's not some teen, female version of the Terminator who can fight her way out of absolutely anything.  While strong and able, her defensive moves are desperate and smart, and as the story goes on, she seems to grow up a bit emotionally as well.Jay was a bit of a mystery to me, and whether that was done on purpose or simply by accident, I think it worked well in the book.  He was street smarts coupled with a big heart, but he was also every bit the teenage boy one might expect, fumbling his way out of danger even as he did his best to look out for Liva.  I couldn't blame Liva for not entirely trusting him, but at the same time I completely understood how she could be falling for him.  His devotion to his family and also to her made him impossible not to love.Speaking of impossible‚Ä¶ It's not easy telling you how great this story is without giving away all the fantastic surprises and shocking twists.  The situation in which Jay and Liva found themselves was an intriguing maze, and just when things started to make sense, something else popped up that didn't fit.  It was the best kind of action-packed mystery and impossible to put down. And that ending?  I can't even‚Ä¶Out of Control is fast-paced and thrilling, the kind of story that has you itching to turn the pages and get to the bottom of things, even as you're devouring every word and scene.  There's a bit of romance for Jay and Liva, but true to the characters' ages and the story's timeline, it's simply the beginning of things, a bit of hope in an ugly situation.  I've never read anything by Sarah Alderson before, but if Out of Control is any indication of what I can expect from her, my to-be-read list is going to be growing quickly.***FicCentral received this book from Xpresso Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2775BLTLEX96M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65ZZKA#wasThisHelpful","R2775BLTLEX96M","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Riley Clifton has always been attached to The Six, a group of six high school boys who have been best friends, partners in innocent teenage crime, and the subject of many a teen fantasy.  But as trusted and platonic as it all seems, not all of The Six look at Riley like just one of the guys.Riley is a bit on the insecure side, spending all her time with these boys that she's placed on something of a pedestal and questioning her own attractiveness when every girl in school seems to want one of The Six.  But they're her best friends, and for all her second-guessing, that friendship means more to her than anything ‚Äî except maybe Jake.  He's the one who has her heart fluttering, even as she tries to stick to the just friends thing.Their story begins at the end, after years in school together and just after their high school graduation, that sliver of time between adolescence and the rest of their lives, when everything begins to change.  The Six will soon be heading in different directions, working toward different futures, while Riley's future remains up in the air.  Rather than revel in that melancholy, they're going to spend one last weekend together raising hell at the cabin.As it turns out, though, the boys have been keeping a secret from her for years, one that has changed and grown and faded over time, and now that they're all headed in different directions, they're ready to come clean.  This is where the story went completely unrealistic and teenage-ideal for me, and while it was cute, it felt a bit forced.  Turns out that they've all been crushing on Riley since forever, but they made a pact not to act on those feelings and ruin their group. Fortunately, those crushes have come and gone over time, and they're not all secretly dying to win her over now, so while it comes as a crazy surprise to her, it also means she's free to choose Jake, the one who gives her butterflies in the best way.Riley's a bit on the dramatic side, but then again she is a teenage girl whose adulthood is beginning and uncertain, and I'm not sure I've ever known a girl her age who hasn't been a frequent traveler on the drama train.  She also wasn't completely alone in her girlhood, having female friends in addition to The Six who made her character a bit more normal and believable.  Their last weekend seemed to be a mix of joy and sadness, though, the culmination of years of friendship and crushes that was coming to a close too soon as they all set off into the world.  There was just enough story to become invested and curious before it all ended on a giant cliffhanger, though, so in the end, I've got some mixed feelings about it.A part of me wants to grab the second book and find out what happens next, but at the same time, I feel like everyone was introduced to me, only to leave too soon.  It's the perfect set-up for a series that focuses on each boy and relationship, but The Summer I Fell didn't really give me enough of any of them to feel like I absolutely have to continue.  It doesn't help that Riley's story was left so unfinished, and the next book isn't focused on her at all, so it's not like that cliffhanger would be resolved.  The Summer I Fell is a cute, quick, coming-of-age story about six best friends and the girl who's always been an addition to their group, and while some of the drama is annoyingly teen, it's also very fitting.  I'll probably wait to see how the reviews come in for the rest of the series, though, before I commit to more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAKNKF9W1BV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7EGO6G#wasThisHelpful","R3HAKNKF9W1BV6","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dawn is a writer ‚Äî or at least she's trying to be.  But she's writing something she knows absolutely nothing about, and when Warner gets a look at what she's written, he doesn't plan on letting her hear the end of it.  What he does plan on is offering his ‚Äúservices‚Äù to clue her in on what hot sex is really like.  For the good of her writing, of course.The Verdict:  Okay, so it's not exactly a secret that I'm not a rabid fan of erotica.  However, I am a big fan of Amber L. Johnson, and since she threw a humorous spin on this one and has already established herself as super-awesome-romance-writer (she has the cape and tights and everything), did you really think I wasn't going to read it?  So after a false start (a.k.a. the big fat NO on NetGalley), one of my favorite book blog tour organizers fed my addiction with a surprise Amazon gift card, and‚Ä¶ Well, I guess I don't have to tell you the first thing I bought with it.  And thus continues my reading and reviewing everything Johnson publishes‚Ä¶Dawn is as awkward as awkward gets when it comes to writing steamy love scenes.  Schooled by bodice rippers and mass produced romances, she doesn't know the first thing about real sex, and I have to say I was utterly mortified for her.  Warner, to be honest, is kind of a jerk, and I hated the way he made fun of her efforts ‚Äî probably just because I'd have died if someone pulled that with me.  But as their lives are explained, it becomes clear that Warner is that proverbial boy on the playground, pulling Dawn's pigtails to get her attention, even though it might make her cry.He's clearly harbored some interest, if not some feelings for her for a very long time, so he takes advantage of the opportunity her bad metaphors present and offers to help her learn her way around the bedroom.  Obviously, it's not a selfless offer ‚Äî he's getting exactly what he wants out of it ‚Äî but it's much more than either of them really bargained for.Their relationship was hilarious and tense and filled with all kinds of emotion, and I have to say that the author got it right when she called it ‚Äúhumorotica.‚Äù  As hot as things got, there was always a little bit of laughter, a refusal to take things too seriously, and some wonderfully realistic awkwardness.  Let's face it, as much as we want to think the love scenes spelled out in romances are the way things really are, we know all too well that nothing is ever that polished and perfect.  Dawn and Warner's romance simply put it in writing and gave us something we could all nod our heads and agree with.I would absolutely recommend this one to anyone who likes a bit of laughter with their love, sex scenes that don't seem scripted or unreal, and a good, strong romance story to back it all up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHB8JE4FII3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6D8ZQS#wasThisHelpful","R3OHB8JE4FII3L","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara has always been the one to take care of her father, both when she was a child and now that she's grown and working as his personal assistant.  Now that his health is in some trouble, keeping him stress-free and eating right is more important than ever.  So how is she supposed to tell him that she's pregnant from a one night stand?  And that she's been going out with one of his players?The Verdict:  While I frequently wanted to slap Sara upside the head and point out just how perfect Cam was for her, it was still a great read.Sara's love for her father is probably what made the most sense to me.  Having been abandoned by her mother when she was just a kid, it's always been her and her dad against the world, so to speak.  However, that abandonment led to her being unable to grow any lasting relationships, whether it came to friends or boyfriends, and until now, she's been okay with that.  But then a one-night stand proved that birth control isn't always effective, and somehow she's got to accept and deal with being pregnant at a time that her dad really can't handle anymore stress.Cam is used to being alone.  It's not that he's averse to socializing or relationships, but he's been putting his mom and his sisters first for so long that he really hasn't made any time for himself.  He cares about the guys on the team with him, though, and he takes his career seriously.  He also takes seriously the sexy shoes his coach's daughter and personal assistant is always wearing.  When a game gets out of hand and sends their coach to the hospital with a ‚Äúheart event‚Äù, Cam's first thought ‚Äî other than to blame himself ‚Äî is for Sara.  He doesn't leave her side while she falls apart over her father, and he makes sure he's there for her afterward.I was a little surprised at how quickly their relationship progressed, but given how broken down Sara was under the circumstances, it's no wonder she was looking for some comfort.  More surprising, though, in the best way, was Cam's reaction to her pregnancy.  It wasn't a reaction at all, really, unless you count his wanting to beat the hell out of whatever guy he imagined knocked her up and left her to deal with the consequences.  That bit there was the beginning of only about a million ways Cam showed that he loved Sara for who she was rather than whatever idea he might have had of her.Sara, though, was resistant to the extreme.  While she had no problem developing a physical relationship, she wasn't willing to let down her guard enough to depend on him, and that tended to drive me a bit nuts.  It also meant that nearly every other thing Cam did was incredibly sweet and selfless, and after a while I started wondering when Sara was finally going to open her eyes and see it.  I kind of wish she'd given in just a little earlier on, so he wouldn't have had to play the role of white knight quite so completely.  But I guess that just does to show that she was messed up from her mom, and he was a better man than she ever could have hoped for.While Delay of Game, like the other books in the series, had a character who was dealing with issues from her past, it was a much lighter read than how the series started out, and I think that's went a long way toward my enjoying it more.  Don't get me wrong; the other books had some light moments and some great happily ever afters, but this one was just lighter all around.  Even with Scotty in the hospital and Sara pregnant and Cam desperate to prove to her that he would never leave her, it managed to be a bit fluffier than its predecessors, so it's a nice uptick in what is turning out to be a pretty great sports romance series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8LXZSNSUWKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990412660#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8LXZSNSUWKS","A1WJAWTQTGFDN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WJAWTQTGFDN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my younger days I was a coffee hater.  My mom and dad both drank coffee black for many years while they smoked their cigarettes and talked over the breakfast table every day.  I couldn't see the allure of either practice.  Black coffee from a Taster's Choice instant or a Folder's brew was thin, bitter and left a terrible aftertaste.  I have hay fever so tobacco for me was even worse, chain smokers almost always drink coffee, I've wondered sometimes if it was to see which could stain their teeth better (although both my parents wore dentures ( a product of the non-fluoride treated water days).  For me coffee was an awful drink.  In my high school years a summer school class with a lot of homework prompted me to drink it for the caffeine, but I had to kill the taste with half a cup of sugar and milk.  Beyond keeping me alert, I still saw no reason to drink coffee as a beverage.  It seemed really strange to me that people would drink decaffeinated coffee, could anyone really enjoy that.In the mid 1980's I worked in Houston, Texas for Houston Lighting and Power Company, know maybe to some of the city dwellers there as ""Houston Looting and Plunder"".  A good reason we drove around in unmarked cars when we did field design work.  Houston was a large and while no New York or Los Angeles, a more cosmopolitan city than my hometown.  They had a wealth of foreign influence in stores, restaurants, and other cultural exchanges.  It was then at a coffee house that featured young jazz musicians and chess, that discovered Cappuccino, Latte, and Mocha.  How could this be coffee I thought?  While I knew milk and sugar made it drinkable, this actually tasted good.  A preppy I worked with back then from a well to do family, who also told me about vintage wines, helped me get educated.  It seems freshly roasted and fine ground quality coffee beans and the type matters as well as the roast was part of the secret.  It then was used in a device that could inject steam and water at high pressure could extract flavor from the grounds and leave the bitter oils and bad tasting parts behind.What a revelation, coffee can taste good if it's made correctly.  Today I even make decent coffee from regular coffee makers by using filtered water, double filters and only a small amount of coffee.  I still have to add cream and other flavors and sugar to help that.  Plus I love iced Cappuccino from Starbucks or Bolthouse foods especially with a little chocolate in the mix. This is the first time I've ever had my own machine, and it may not be world class, but for the money and simplicity here, this is one of the best going.  It even uses pods for Espresso, although don't mistake what I mean here or in the description, these are not those little cups things, these are pod's with finely packed coffee pre-measured for use in the machine.  Note, it does it the non-pod way too so that makes it flexible and if freshness counts you should get beans and grind your own.For those not educated on this stuff you'll need a conical burr grinder (around a hundred to a hundred fifty dollars), if you get blade type they are cheaper but will make a much poorer Espresso, with the bitters intact.  The thousand dollar fancy machines often include the grinder, buy were talking bare bones here, and given grinders break, why have a machine with them combined.  This machine is easy to use, but especially if you do a lot you do need to do some cleaning and maintenance.  I think it needs de-calcified every 200 cups.  You might get away a bit longer if you always use distilled water like I do, but if you use tab, it will need that.  The acid based chemicals are recommended by De'Longhi, I doubt you have to heed buying theirs only, but it is a safe choice if you know where to get them (probably the Zon).  This comes with three metal filters a scoop and tamper for the grounds drip platform (which removes for a taller cup), and not too much else besides the machine.  You need to buy your  own Espresso shot glasses, cups, mugs, pitchers, whatever you might need as well as some of the branded cleaning kits, and like I said if you don't want the pods, a conical burr grinder.  It is important to show off with fresh coffee, so they didn't include any samples it would dampen the mood if you tasted old expired stuff.I went to Meijer and used their in store burr grinder with fresh beans and made my own blend of medium dark with a fine grind.  Espresso uses a much finer grind than normal coffee and it's pressed in tight.  I tamped it in the machine and made myself a double added the hot milk some chocolate and a bit of sugar to sweeten it up.  I drank it hot and later tried some cold and both were very good.  Not quite Bolthouse, but better than the bitter stuff I had as a kid.  Recommended for most lovers of good coffee, Barista style beverage drinkers.  Save your self some money on that morning Starbucks, cup and make your own.  You can even by the coffee there if you love it so much, but most supermarkets have a good supply and variety of beans for almost any taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8RHD7ZPP14Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6ZNU#wasThisHelpful","R2U8RHD7ZPP14Z","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Dad had one of the illegal ones of these that were not medically certified and it was very powerful.  He never let me try it, but I got enough exercise as a kid so I really didn't need extra toning.  Now that I'm older and sit in front of a computer or the boob tube (or is it boob screen now) most days, my arm muscles are much weaker than when I was younger.  Yes, it's probably better to go to the gym and lift run, or even swim, but time motivation and procrastination set in and well you know...  Here we have something you can strap on your muscles and it will move them for you.  Maybe a bit scary at first because involuntary movements bother me and maybe most people, but there's a decent amount of science and history on this device to believe it's safe.I did one of the 15 minute programs and was surprised how sore my arms were the next day, it actually hurt a little to do the program again the next day, but I wanted to see the combined effect.  Real muscle building takes along time to build and I don't know how effective this will be, but you lose tone quickly and this can capture that.  I think it will build some muscle over a period of months, but if you want big gains you should probably do some dumbbells as well.  For me it's perfect, I'm no body builder and just want to maintain enough arm strength to do normal things around the home.  I this one would also work or abs and maybe even leg muscles like my Dads old set did.The pads are reusable several times and very comfortable to wear.  After the initial shock of muscles contracting by themselves I was able to read and work on the computer while this was happening.  I'm not sure how long a charge lasts yet, but I go to sleep easily, and I wonder if I could sleep for 30 minutes and wake up with these on.  I'll have to give it a try.  You've got 99 steps and three programs which is probably all that are needed for the targeted muscle groups.  From what I've read the Slendertone is a misnomer sales wording.  You are not likely to lose any arm flab from the exercise these do, but in the long term more muscle does use up more calories faster, so there may be some slight effect on weight loss if you keep using these for several months.Nice safe product recommended for the older folk like me that want to keep our arms from getting weaker, maybe for a younger person to supplement their training.  I Recommend for all but children, and those who might have pace makers or other medical devices or acute heart conditions that might not respond well to electrical stimulation ask your doctor if you're not sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUQY50CBNXQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U19SX2#wasThisHelpful","R3RUQY50CBNXQX","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's about time someone re-purposed the rice cooker for us non-Asians.  Don't get me wrong, I love Asian cooking, I have a wok I've seasoned for 20 years, and I make my own sushi, rolled eggs, miso soup, and several other Asian themed dishes.  Still I'm an American with an English, Irish, German, background, and grew up on hotdogs, hamburgers, steak and potatoes, and mac and cheese.  This is a short way of saying that my rice cookers are not daily use devices like in the typical Eastern household.  What Phillips has done here has created the software to take a medium sized rice cooker, and made it to not just do rice, but to do pasta, stews, chicken, and even bake desserts.  The recipe guide that came with it has a lot of rice dishes in the beginning, then it graduates to pasta, stews, chili, a whole chicken, and finally desserts like cakes and cheesecakes.  The recipes are in three languages, one English, and most are not just toss it in the pot and shut the lid, it does make nice use of the device without having to dirty other cookware.I made the risotto with prosciutto (although I used a cured thin sliced ham), it had many steps, but the recipe came out very good, I happened to have just the right kind of rice and stock, so I followed the recipe precisely and it worked out well.  I'll have to try one of those cakes sometime, but I think it can do the job.  Controls are easy with the menu selections, there are programs you just select and it works pretty much like a rice cooker with more options, but you do need to stand by and do the interim cooking changes at the correct times.The cooker came with some nice prep ware, a rice paddle, a large spoon with a side slotted drain, a measuring, cup, and a strainer steamer type thing that looks like you can cook and cool eggs in some dimpled fixtures.  The bowl was heavy like a typical rice cooker and the graphic showed it to be of quality heat retention and even cooking created layers.  For baking and browning this has to get somewhat hotter than a typical rice cooker, but it seems to be up to the task melting butter and browning the onions for the risotto was fairly easy.  This is a very nice addition to my kitchen appliances .Recommended, for those who like a versatile device that will do rice, and much more.  There's been a lot of TV crap sold for similar prices that did little more than grill a sandwich or some other one note cooking task.  A lot of us have been caught with that sales pitch, this thing is genuinely versatile and you can hardly ask for more.  I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSF9FTTQKX3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R1JSF9FTTQKX3E","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Impressions, the OnHub box was heavier than expected and the box, it was very unusual.  A finely constructed teal colored box with a form fitting place for the device and a magnetic latch to keep the lid from popping open, you just can't toss this away.  If not for future transport of the device it at least needs to be re-purposed for storage.  Maybe Googles clever way of not creating trash, few would toss this box, it even smells nice, most will find it useful to store something in.  With the wrapping off it's an unmarked attractive teal container with a wedge shaped lid that could sit most anyplace and not be an eyesore.  Next the device, well designed and attractive on the outside, well protected with plastic and some static stick-ons to mark the inputs.  I was worried that I couldn't use my computer to connect although I did indirectly, I have no smartphone service, I have a smart phone without a sim card and I can use it as a Wi-Fi device so I set it up and connected to Google.Set-up was very easy, I had a Google account, I rarely used it, but I do use the Chrome browser, and my Android phone had all the app places pre-linked so it was easy to get connected and download the OnHub app.  Once done it prompted me to connect the power and Ethernet cable to the OnHub, and put the phone close while it played a tone and sent a secret pass-code to the phone app.  Then it started to download an update, it was supposed to tell me when it was done, but that function didn't work well, so I stopped and restarted the app and it prompted me for a network name and a password.  I gave it that and then connected my laptop in the back room along with my phone to the new sub-network I'd created.My initial concerns were groundless this is a great product.  I have a large house, too large for me maybe, but at least there's a lot of room for living.  My internet connection comes from a cable modem in the front of the house, a ranch style, with an add on master bedroom addition in the back, that extends the house about 80 feet from front to back.  Likewise, my Wi-Fi is roughly 70 to 80 feet from where my laptop and network printer are in the back bedroom, through 4 walls, going through two bedrooms, and two baths.  My Wi-Fi router is dual band and fairly powerful, but I've still had poor connectivity especially on the laptop.  I've tried to stream Crunchyroll, an anime streaming service, and I always have to downgrade it for slower connections.  Crunchyroll on the computer has SD, 480P, 720P, and 1080P as selections speeds.  At the hotel I stay at while working, I can only connect to SD, because that connection is weak.  In my back bedroom before, SD would barely sustain without being choppy or having frequent freezes.  With the OnHub Wireless, I was able to get 720P with little or no issues, but 1080P still had some choppiness to the signal.  It could be that I was using a six year old Dell laptop with a medium definition screen. The screen I used to view was a 1080P separate monitor, connected by a VGS cable.  The processor, and integrated graphics processor may have had something to do with the slowdown. I suspect on a better machine; it may have worked more seamless.  Still the comparison was dramatic, in fact I could connect back and forth, because I've wired the OnHub out of my router, so I have two full networks, and the OnHub, the wireless stream is by far the best.More information that may be of interest, if you have a computer you can connect this as a sub-network as I have from you're existing router, just plug the Ethernet cable into one of the free hardwired ports, most routers have 5 or 6.  If you were using this as a primary hub, note it is limited in itself as there is only one hardwired output port, so if you have a wired system and you want this to replace a wired router this is not the answer.  This product was not intended for that.  Today we are starting to rely less on the computer and more on tablets, smartphones and other devices and that is what this is for.  You don't need a computer at all the device could have been set-up without my computer just plugging it directly to the cable modem.  It may be a little ahead of its time right now by not by much.Recommended, for those who want to improve their home network, whether you already have a router or not, this can replace it or extend it to create a second network for your streaming devices, network printers, or wireless connected laptops.  Well worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTCSNIAVBQIXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ALA9LA#wasThisHelpful","RTCSNIAVBQIXR","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(SEE UPDATE PAST INITIAL PARAGRAPH)I think mine is broken.  I swapped the batteries in the remote a couple times, tested them to make sure they had power.  When I turned it on the LED kept blinking.  I thought it might be a handshaking connection to the drone, so I turned it ON and it blinked and went steady with it's lights.  I hit the juice button and about every other combination of buttons to no avail.  I charged the drone for hours, but no LED ever came on.  It did light up the 4 colored running lights when I turned it on, but the props never turned from the control.  The instructions were in Korean, I think although the  box had info in English, Spanish and French.  They had a website so I could see the English version of the manual.  There was no diagnostic info on what blinking lights meant, and I was apparently pushing the right buttons to make it fly.UPDATE:  I Did get it to fly and it was kind of cool but I finally lost the thing under the bed.  It is hard to control, I'm not sure how well the gyros are supposed to keep it in place, but mine kept getting under the furniture.  I was surprised how powerful the thing is, and maybe if I were more patient I would have learned to fly it better.  That said, with limited fly time between charges and maybe a need for a replaceable battery pack, I'm not sure how much fun someone 8-11 years old would have for this.  I might have labeled it 12+ as at least then you have a bit more of a scientific curiosity, but that's just my opinion.  For younger kids however the unpredictable flight, could possibly result in eye injuries if not careful, so I'm not sure it's for them on safety issues as well.My biggest issue for me is that they make larger drones that can carry cameras or other payloads for similar prices.  It may take time to learn to fly those, but you can use them out of doors.  Some people might miss-use the camera capability, but I'd love to have a thing that could inspect my roof and gutters for damage or need cleaning.  Its a cool world to fly up into the trees and such to see a squirrels nest or other such things.  This is an indoor toy and it's a lot of money for so little flight time.  It's nice with the stunts and such it can do, but ultimately, it's something that past the initial fascination there won't be much replay value.  Not as bad as I thought, but I really don't see much use for it.It's maybe prophetic that the instructions on the web site had a big section on proper disposal of the drone because of the Lithium battery.  I have a feeling I'm going to need that real soon.  Drone itself is tiny barely over 3 inches square and pretty flimsy.  I envisioned this a little bigger, their are less expensive ones on Amazon that come with cameras and such.  I think the thing was trying to communicate, but never got past the initialization phase.  I would turn on the drone first and it flashed it's LEDs then I'd turn on the remote and it would flash and the LED's of the drone when on steady, but the remote stayed flashing and none of the controls did anything.Unfortunately, for TX juice they fail on almost all aspects of my grading.  It's cheaply built, no quality control, no proper instructions, and recommended for 8-17 years.  I think most 8-10 year olds would break this in half an hour (assuming theirs actually worked).  I don't recommend this for anyone, and even if it did work, I'd hardly pay over a hundred bucks for something like this, there are much better alternatives.  FYI, they need to put English instructions in the package or they'll be a lot of returns.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KCYTQUXRCAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R16KCYTQUXRCAA","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the type of work I've done, I have a lot of experience using various types of office chairs.  Because of my size my last two employers have ordered me heavy duty chairs.  I have ordered and used the same heavy duty types at home to sit in front of my computer.  This chair is not fully heavy duty, but it does have a couple features I like in non-heavy duty chairs. One company I worked at had a group called the Ergo Team, they would confirm your posture, desk and chair height, whether you needed a foot tilt pad on the floor, hand rests for your computer mouse etc.  They were the first to provide me a heavy duty chair.  For the assembly, I took every thing out of the big box and then used it to support the seat and star structure while I attached the wheels, back and arms.  The process took around 15 minutes, but I could do it in less if I'd had multiple chairs after the first one was together.A good chair yes, some issues plus and minus, that may limit who will like it.Things I love about the chair:1.  The side arms are not fully integrated into the seat and they adjust out for a wide or narrow person within a large range.2.  The seat portion of the chair is wide and deep enough to cover my backside and hips, some chairs I feel like I'm slipping off.3.  The side arms have easy adjustments up and down, and the width locks in place after adjustments.4.  The back support seemed gentle and worked well with the small of my back.5.  I liked the cooling mesh, it was very hot and humid in the offices this past week, I could have used this.6.  Chair structure was heavy a very solid feel to it.7.  Assembly was easy and they included the Allen wrench, although you still need a flat blade screwdriver to finish the arms.Some things not to like or more to body type preference:1.  The wheel support star is all plastic although that's the norm, often steel ones are used on heavy duty types.2.  The side arms do not adjust in far enough to support a very thin person, and seem to always be a little loose.3.  The seat is maybe too wide and deep for a fairly thin person.4.  Unless you have long arms all the seating controls cannot be reached when sitting in the chair.5.  The chair gas powered height adjustment does not bring the chair up as high as most.The height issue is probably a personal preference, people much taller than my 5' 7"" have no problem sitting very low in chairs.  I don't know if that is a posture issue, but it could be.  This chair sat a few inches lower at full height, than the three office type chairs I have here at home.  I would think someone with long legs would have an issue keeping a 90 degree leg bend in sitting posture.  I often adjust chairs all the way up when entering conference rooms so I know most people prefer the lower ones, it's for you to decide, but it won't get very tall.I would recommend this to medium to large, but not very large body types.  The adjustment range is good and the chair has a good array of mid range to slightly big and heavy adjustments.  These back mesh chairs are wonderful for the back, and at my next to last employer when they did a facility move a lot of people fought over possession of these types of mesh chairs as they were in short supply.  I didn't like the ones they fought over, because the seats were narrow and did not support my backside well enough, but that lumbar support was very nice.  If you think you fit the description, this would be a nice chair for the home office at the discounted price on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEIAVSNJKVE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OA8EQ2#wasThisHelpful","R2SEIAVSNJKVE3","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Took a while for me to set this up, but it's a bit nicer than I thought.  It came in giant box and when I pulled it out it was about a foot and a half taller than I expected, but I guess it needs that to hang some of the clothes.  The manual is small and too the point.  It came with a kit that contained a variety pack of 12 detergent cups.  Not really detergent, but formula's to renew various clothing items, labeled as unwind, awaken, and recharge.  I assume that's the effect on the clothing.  I tried a cotton short, long sleeve, I left in the dryer all week while I was at work.  I used an awaken, and did a 15 minute run, you have the choice of 10 or 15.  It took out most but not all of the wrinkles, and the shirt did smell nice, but it didn't look as crisp and sharp as the guy in the picture wearing the shirt and tie.  It is fast and I'm not one to iron things, so it works for me when I want to wear dress shirts and pants.If you register they send you a coupon for 2 more hangers, I'm not sure why you need three, but maybe there is a special purpose.  I've read online about using water in place of the refresher cups, if Tide stops making them it will help keep this from being a boat anchor.  You could probably mix your own formula too.  I don't recommend it though since they sell these cheaply direct to the company.  For some reason buying them through Amazon is expensive with the shipping markups, and I didn't see a free shipping link.  Through Swash site, though you can get a large quality for 5.99 a 12 pack and free shipping if you buy a  moderate amount.  I'm going to stock up a bit.Lights tell you where you are in the cycle and when you're done.  Although it's too tall for a lot of places, it's not very wide so I fit in behind a big chair in the corner of the master bedroom and it works well there.  I may have gotten a better ""press job"" if I'd used the clips I read about later on the sides of the frame around the hanger.  I'll have to try that next time.  Seems more like a men's valet item then something for women though, it may be tall, but I don't know if it would work well doing a dress or special fabrics.  Somewhat of a specialty item.Recommended for men who have to wear ""business attire a lot"", may cut down on the dry cleaning bills and certainly save them time, especially if they are single.  I think most women would probably want one of those steam washer things they sell instead.  They do similar types of cleanings and do regular laundry as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3I92B9PYQ4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7R60KK#wasThisHelpful","R2B3I92B9PYQ4J","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess to glancing at some other reviews on this which I don't normally do except for food products, or after I finish a review to see if I missed something important I should look at.  I had noticed that ACIA was missing in the ingredients list, you had to get past almonds and chocolate even get to the fruit part of the ingredients (ingredients have to be listed in order of amount used in a product).  Honestly if there is ACIA flavor in here or not I don't really know, it certainly doesn't show up, and ACIA flavor is very strong and somewhat sour tasting, so it could be hear to balance the sweetness, but I don't detect it.Why list ACIA in the first place?  Because Kale and other known health foods, it brings in the healthy eating crowd. I occasionally get those chocolate covered or fruit and nut bars at the grocery.  Most of the time they price out to around 50 cents each.  These are about $2.25 each if you don't count shipping.  They are however higher quality, and they did formulate this for taste.  Some people are genuine health food people and live their live that way.  Most people will want to try that lifestyle on for a time to see if they can stand it or are pushed into it by family or spouse.  Most of the time those who do cheat, why get a raw blend of beat and carrot juice at the healthy place when you can go to Smoothie King and tell yourself your strawberry and banana smoothie is healthy.  Vegetarians eat Garden Burgers and textured soy bacon rather than living on salad and granola, at least till they realize all the non-copy vegetarian dishes that can be made.Why do I say all that because that is what is being counted on here, you may get some fiber, but antioxidents are all but gone, and there's a lot of added sweeteners to keep this tasting good and addictive.  It's good though, perhaps too good to pretend to be healthy food.  I spent unreal amounts of money paying for 4.00 a pound organic tomatoes and other organics when I was juicing, so I might buy these if I thought they were a healthy snack.  To tell the truth they do seem to invoke much less guilt than the last Snickers or Butterfinger, I inhaled at the office.Whats the bottom line, well they didn't do that awful taste between good and bad, and marginal or no heath benefits thing a lot of healthy stuff seems to do.  There are a surprisingly lot of pseudo healthy foods that taste bad, but we eat them for the supposed benefits.  They don't play that game they made this less healthy to make it taste good!  Knock off a star if your on a budget, and really wanted a healthy snack for the kids, think trail mix maybe, or just carrot sticks and lite ranch dip.  Probably the best of these fruit and nut type bars I've tasted and I've had over a dozen kinds over the years.  Many were pretty good, but these win out.  Recommended to those who like the fruit, nut and chocolate bars, but don't mistake this for overly healthy food, but a step up from most candy bars to be sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5985552COV62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BUDN5W#wasThisHelpful","R5985552COV62","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work out of town a lot recently and stay in low or modestly priced hotel rooms. Most inexpensive rooms include a small desk, near or including a lamp and a decent office type chair.  This is normally expected to be used for perhaps work or play on a laptop or tablet computer.  One hotel upgraded to a strip that attached to the rear of the desk top that included USB charger outlets and standard 3 wire electrical plugs.  It was very useful; I no longer had to have the laptop connected to provide the powered USB ports to charge my phone or the GPS I use in my vehicle.Most of the power strips I have at home are either basic or may have cable TV style coax connectors.  Those are nice for surge protection as well as often lighting can fry your TV, VCR, cable box etc.  This device does not include those, but I noted a long list of features that some models have so you can get that kind of thing selectively.  What I don't have at home are any USB charger outlets, so now I can use this and take it with me to the hotels that have not upgraded their rooms yet to have USB outlets.So what out of the list does this strip include, I reviewed the list of possible features.  It has surge protection, an incredibly fast response time of one nanosecond (one billionth of a second); it filters electromotive and radio frequency noise.  It provides voltage protection to 500V, surge to 6000V and voltage spikes to 30000V.  There is a surge LED, it the device is plugged in and turned on and that is out, throw out the device and get a new one.  Hopefully it did its job protecting your equipment.  If it did not maybe you can claim it on the 100 thousand dollar insurance policy the device claims.  It has another LED below the two USB charge ports that is on when your USB device is plugged in and charging.  Although I can't test this, I think the ON/OFF switch is a combination circuit breaker that can be reset if the operation of it was not of the destructive type.Note, it should be known that even for the power companies most surge protectors that are hit with lightning or larger voltage surges self-destruct in performing their protective duties, while the breaker may kick out for some lower voltage high current events, and can be reset, a high voltage strike usually destroys the protective semiconductor material used to protect for very high voltage surges.Despite a reasonably low price, the block appears to be well (solid) built, and the cord is heavy duty, although at 3 feet, it won't stretch very far from the plug-in.  The device is rated at 1800 Watts that's more than the typical hair dryer or small space heater, but you should remember that the outlet you plug it into may have other things connected to it, so you may trip one of the house breakers.  I don't really recommend plugging high draw resistance devices like toasters and space heaters in anyway.  They don't normally need surge protection unless they have a solid state electronic control system, just heating coils and fan motors are fairly resistant to surges on their own.What I would have liked to see off the feature list options was the wider plug room for transformers (adapters), but they are close together on this device.  Initially I thought it had another feature that would fix that some, but it turned out to be something else.  What I notice was the outlets appeared to rotate; they actually did not what rotated was a cap that closed them off when turned.  A nice feature to keep small children and pets from somehow getting inside the powered outlet, or to keep dust and debris out.There are some things I can't test without destroying the device and risking my equipment, but I'll take their word for it now that it works until proven wrong.  This has the underwriter‚Äôs laboratory seal (UL approved) on the bottom so that's a good sign they have done the tests I can't do.  One more thing on the back it has 4 of those key shaped slots for hanging up or fixing this to a surface.  I find this useful since the ones I have are always being knocked off the back of the computer kiosk or off the wall ledges.  Recommended for smart phone users or with other USB charging tasks.  Woods makes many different models, so choose the one you like best for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TE7CTMZUVM4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFKUHBS#wasThisHelpful","R1TE7CTMZUVM4M","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Big boys still like their toys.  It's hard to say with all the distractions out there today if something like this is as popular as it once was, or could have been.  I had HO 1/87th scale cars, 1/32nd I ran on hobby store tracks that I build from just parts and a plastic car body, a 1/24th scale mini-0.049 displacement engine that ran around in circles at nearly 30 MPH actual speed when tethered to a nail in the asphalt.  I had a set my dad got me, but never cared too much for Hot Wheels (mainly because they were gravity powered), not gas or electric.  I watched as the Aurora cars I used to tinker with in HO scale trying everything, from silver plated pick-up contacts to special brushes, to silicon tires, to special wound pancake engine coils, all to have it be blown a way buy a new breed of HO racers with super magnets (rare earth) and engines that in the standard cheapo set could blow away any of my carefully crafted models.  I guess around then I thought I was getting too old for the hobby.Here decades later I can't resist the allure of playing with a larger version of these toys.  The super magnet technology that started years ago makes these larger models much faster than they have a right to be with such small power supplies.  They can't beat the gasoline powered cars of back then, and some of those had radio controls as well, but then they don't run out of gas every five minutes either.  This zips around pretty good, the construction of the front would probably not take to many hits so don't run into a hard object.  I thought the plastic molding could have been more detailed, but they did a nice job on all the racing decals and stripes.Control was easy, but the range seemed to be lacking some, and the control is not made to take a big pounding.It could go forward, backward, and turn in any direction (except up or down, it's not a plane).  No batteries come with it, so have a lot of AA's on hand and a few AAA's for the remote, it works with Alkaline, Lithium, or regular, but regulars don't last long, so don't buy batteries at the dollar store.If your kids are into race cars or just something that moves, this makes a nice birthday gift.  Older men like myself may just like the look of the car and post the model up on the mantle display shelving, only to come down occasionally when our second child takes over for a while.  Recommended for all ages that like cars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMBXWA5UWCF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9QMTGO#wasThisHelpful","RJMBXWA5UWCF0","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second Wrangler shirt I'm reviewing, this was all cotton as well, but it lacks the brushed softness of the first one.  It makes a more dressier version of shirt types, it could probably be used with a sport jacket and I would not use the soft plaid of the first shirt I reviewed that way.  This still had the same issue as the other shirt, the 3XL does not translate to knit versions  of (BIG) rated 3XL and is closer to a 1XL in that regard.  The exception is the collar size which probably is 3XL.  This is for taller thinner big men not those with a larger girth around the middle like myself.  Quality seemed to be there, I washed it with something white and didn't see any red dye on the white item.  It did not appear to shrink in the medium hot dryer or warm water wash.The short sleeves suited me more than the long, but I have the same problem, I need to drop about 25 pounds to wear this.  Recommended for tall men who use 3XL or BIG men who use 1XL.  More of a dressier look so you might wear this one to work or the office if you can stand a little color.  I didn't find any hanging threads, or loose stitches, so despite third world assembly for the most part the quality is there.  It's not the comfortable lay about shirt, but if you need a more suit worthy number without going to a white button down, this is it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WO199SXV6DHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7IUYG#wasThisHelpful","R1WO199SXV6DHD","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected when I first saw it that the neck would be too small, but it turned out to be the stomach area.  I wear 3X knit shirts that fit perfectly; they don't stretch or hang too loose all the time.  My conclusion is at least for Wrangler, full button down shirts are cut for taller, but not necessarily big which requires a different cut.  I like the shirt besides that, I tried the size before washing and drying and it didn't shrink any detectable level, I was surprised the collar fit, as I have trouble finding white button down dress shirts that the collars don't strangle me.The 100 percent cotton was very soft, almost a brushed feel for this shirt.  It was made in Bangladesh, so I think the cost to make it was low, but so was the listed price.  If I lost about 25 pounds I could probably wear it, but if you get big man‚Äôs clothes greater than one XL, then you probably won't fit this, but one XL would probably be about perfect for the normal fit.  I'm 5' 7"" with short arms, and these were not too bad considering the size.  I usually avoid long sleeves since most of the time they lengthen with the shirt size and I'm not that tall.  I would love it if Wrangler considered a more bell shaped big man‚Äôs button down shirt or at least with no taper at the waist.Recommended if you are big and wear 1X, or are six feet or better, (you could then consider the 3X rated size) and don't have the bigger belly to pop the buttons.  The shirt construction looks well sewn, and based on my washing test and hot dryer, it must be at least pre-shrunk.  The color is sort of a faded look to start so it will go nice with well-worn faded jeans.  Very soft, and since its 100 percent cotton, I didn't detect any itching inherit to the material.  If you have sensitive skin this works if you wash it in something that doesn't irritate your skin.  Cotton by itself generally does not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD58M9J6Y2UB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7JS1U#wasThisHelpful","RD58M9J6Y2UB7","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kind of what I expected here it is a characteristic of modern modems to be fairly comparable.  The proof of life so to speak is the durability of the modem itself.  I've had five or six cable modems over the years having first subscribed to Comcast in 2004 when I bought my house.  Here is a little education for those who don't understand home computer networking.  I won't go into the specifics of operation; you can read that online if you want.  Basically, a cable modem is one that connects to the TV cable coax line, a screw on connection you've likely seen on your TV for years if you have cable tv or even used to connect to stand alone antennas for VHF tv reception in the past.  The data coming in from the cable must be translated, regulated, decrypted, etc. for you to connect to your PC.Now you can connect a cable modem directly to your PC with an Ethernet cable, the ends look like a larger version of a standard phone connection cable, but have more contacts.  With the world of hackers and virus crazy computer nuts out there, you don't want to connect to the modem directly, so you normally connect your modem to a device called a router.  Some internet service providers (ISP's) cable companies or fiber optic companies use a combination modem and router in one box.  If you have that arrangement this is not for you, and it may be better to rent the combo unit.  If you use individual devices like many do, this is the way to go.  The connection of this from the Ethernet side goes to your router which is another similar looking box with similar looking lights on it and several Ethernet connections in the back.  It also likely provides wireless data distribution, this modem does not do that, this is the communication between you and the cable company.  The router is different; it separates the hardwired signals for direct wired PC's and it can provide a wireless signal for them to connect to.If you use a router to support a wireless network it will have a data transfer rating and a typical range for signal strength.  The data rate this supports is much greater than the wireless data transfer rates, so if this does not improve your data stream over your old model for wireless, it likely has nothing to do with this cable modem, the router is the weak link in wireless, and the more expensive models typically have better range and transfer rates.  The 384 Mbps data rate is for a hardwired connection to the modem not for wireless.  DOCSYS 3.0 came out a few years back when the cable companies were setting up of more reliable streaming.  The description says something about innovative channel bonding, but that has been around for a while with any DOCSYS 3.0 modem.  It simply means rather than switching to the best channel like old modems did, they connect to typically 4 at the same time and bring in the data without disconnecting and reconnecting.  If you've had a system for over six years or so you may remember your modem resetting and the lights reconnecting frequently.  It was looking for a better channel.  It drove me crazy when I used to read a lot of online Japanese Manga, as turning the pages, it would drop out and I'd have to wait a minute or so for it to go to the next page after reconnect, DOCSYS 3.0 cured all that.What‚Äôs to like about this one, it's blessed (certified) by Comcast Xfinity for use with streaming on their system.  It's inexpensive and if it lasts more than a year, it will save you money on rentals.  I generally see them die at 2-3 years on a well-used system like mine.  If this one outlasts that time, I'll return and give it another star.  Recommended, for most cable TV subscribers that use cable based internet connections, especially for Comcast.  If you're not a Comcast subscriber check with your cable company.  Of course you need to subscribe to the service, they have to decrypt your modem on your network, so you'll have to make a call and trade some numbers on the device.Not recommended for DSL users, dial-up users, fiber optic users, and in most cases users of the combo modem / router unit.  Although with Comcast cable you can have a combo unit, and may have the option to remove it and use a separate modem and router, but ask the provider.  Comcast typically provides combo units for apartments, I had that setup in Chicago for a while when I rented while working a contract job.  It was nice and convenient and the wireless wasn't too bad for signal, but it did have to be reset a lot, it tended to freeze up.  Read the instructions on these how to interpret the lights, sometimes your network can be down; sometimes it's the cable company.For those who don't know, when this is set up you don't need to keep a hardwired computer connected and ON to support your wireless network if you have a working modem and wireless router, you can connect your printers, wireless tablets, phones, tv's, Roku, FireTV or other streaming devices to  the network and use it stand alone.  It does not depend on the computer you first connect it too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYHOGTLALZ4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29YF8#wasThisHelpful","R3VYHOGTLALZ4V","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great value for the dollar in electronics I always seem to get these just when I need them.  I have some really nice amplified bookshelf speakers.  I use a streaming service on my laptop to get NFL games, but unfortunately the sound link with the HDMI is broken and if I use my older laptop, it has a VGA connection so no sound either.  The good news is both laptops have Bluetooth, so I was able to relocate the bookshelf speakers and connect them with this rather than having them sit right by me connected to the laptop directly.  The sound transfer is much cleaner than I expected.  I've had previous devices using RF technology to transfer sound and video from my computer to a TV and it was awful, so I never used it.  I can see a lot of use from this.I had some other devices that I thought were impressive because they could remember two Bluetooth connections, eight is almost overkill, but the moment I say that I may end up with another phone or tablet that can use this.  I connected the MP3 player and radio in my BLU smartphone to the same speakers and that worked well, for these prices, I might consider getting another for the back bedroom, which as a Bose and some other large stereo equipment, and one more for the basement to connect with my stereo and Sony 300 CD changer. Thats three very large rooms that could be connected.  Recommended for the connected among us, if you have a good sound system that's not already Bluetooth connected this will link you up to your phone.  Plus, I'm relatively certain not using your phones or tablet speakers will save battery power for longer play times if you listen to music a lot.  A must have for the price.UPDATE:  I've had a number of powered speakers in various sizes, and I like my football games rebroadcast from an NFL streaming site, but the excitement was just not there.  I had my pizza, Coca Cola, and chips ready to go, but even though the laptop connected with the 40"" hotel TV, the HDMI sound doesn't work on the laptop and those speakers are in sufficient.  I took of my amplified pairs about 5"" X 9"" each and connected them via Bluetooth with this link.  Instant excitement!  Take away the hotel calling my room in the 4th quarter because someone registered a noise complaint, and it was almost as good as watching a live broadcast!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185TMXKRDAGYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPATOEE#wasThisHelpful","R185TMXKRDAGYT","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GPS is amazing!  I can think back a decade or so when early GPS was expensive and had accuracy issues, plus or minus about 50 feet.  Today the accuracy is nearly spot on and it makes this a very useful range finder.  Nice graphics show the greens and the design of the fairways as taken from the database.  Not everything was exactly where it showed in the graphic, but pin placements change and databases take time to get updated.  There is a facility on the GolfBuddy site to report variations, but unless it's a PGA course, I doubt it's totally there.  I reported that the phone numbers for my town and another carried a 14 year old area code in their database, so that may be an indication as to how old some of this is.  If your course has changed much and not reported it, you may have some issues.  The old course I went too hasn't changed in a long time if ever so the holes were pretty much as presented.  It's cool how the watch knows where it is when you walk on the course property, but that's GPS for you.The watch itself is a bit bulky for everyday where, but you could.  I thought an application like this might be something for the Apple watch, but that would take a smart phone and they'd need to license the GB database if they did one.  Add to that the Apple watch as a watch you have to charge everyday.  If you use the watch mode on this it will last weeks, but only 8 hours in golf mode.  Still that's better than Apple watch having to do it every day.  Voice would be nice, and some GB's have it this does not.  It would still need to be an on off option if it did since you'd not want to break your partners concentration, driving or putting (or would you).  I like the nicely highlighted blue black colors and the screen has a nice contrast to see the graphics.  They are not in color, but then it would need a bigger battery most likely.  Plus this is used outdoors so the black matrix is a little more visible than would be a color screen.  Recommended for the golfer in the family, I wish there was a better way to maintain the database automatically, but was somewhat impressed the rink a dink course I use was on it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAKUYZJBHX7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOYN7J8#wasThisHelpful","R3UAKUYZJBHX7J","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew those previous earbuds I reviewed were overpriced and this sure proves the point.  The retail on these is one fifth of a set of earbuds I'd reviewed recently for the VINE.  I liked the previous ones, the sound was good, but I knew I'd never by them even at the 25 percent discounted price.  These have more plastic in the construction, but the sound and function do not lack at all compared to the higher end versions.  The ones I reviewed before used oval shaped cords to prevent tangle, these use cloth woven cords that remind you of the pre-plastic days of electronics.  Both styles work and do not easily tangle up.  This also has a cord keeper clip, useful if you keep your player in your front pocket as I sometimes do.  At work, I sometimes listen to the radio sports broadcast on the smartphone.  These work fine as the antenna (something that needs tested, as many smartphone radios use these as the antenna) and give me enough rope (cord length) to not strangle myself moving around at the computer to grab coffee or paperwork to use.Sound quality, well at my age I can't here the highs very well anymore so since there was no static, the treble sounded good.  Base seemed OK, about as good as you can expect from ear buds, but nothing earth shattering.  If you want real base, you need to point a subwoofer at the floor, you're not going to do it justice with headphones or buds.  They come in colors, and I suppose at these prices, if you're female and want to you good get more sets and coordinate.  I've really no use for the microphone so I won't comment on it.  Recommended, nice quality for a very low price considering the quality of the set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4G7B6QTRM5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LY86XG#wasThisHelpful","R3J4G7B6QTRM5J","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought before this came it would probably lose a star because of the quality.  Most of the time I'd be right because typically individual pieces that have to sell on their own either become mediocre functioning cheapies or expensive personal grill master items.  That said even at a little over a hundred bucks, I didn't expect such a great set. Where do I start, to begin with we have a flavor injector, I bought one of these for my kitchen that was steel and expensive at nearly 50 bucks.  This has the advantage of being clear so see whats in it, and what is left, and it came with two injection needles for different grades of herbs and spices.  The output holes are on one side so you can have some control of where you put the injected condiments.Next up lets talk the carrier designed as an apron and a storage device, everything has a place and it rolls up leaving two carry handles joined together by Velcro and ties that serve both the apron and the carry bag modes.  Nice design.Hardware, a spatula with a really nice wood handle, but not just at the end, all the way to the business end so you can have better control if your working close to the grill. This comes in handy for flipping things that you might drop at a distance, and don't want to risk breaking them up with the tongs.  The tongs themselves are very long, and have a wide business end to grip steaks, brats, corn, etc.  They have drainage slots and are spring loaded to release when you let go of the food.  There is a nice long handled basting brush too, if you like to do ribs or slow cooked brisket.Some nice skewers for kabobs, corn, or just to do dogs or brats right over the flame.  For clean up they have another long handled with full tyne tool with a scraper and wire bush on the end.  The wood handle is again all the way to the scraper end so you can have full control for those difficult clean-ups on a big grill.  Highly recommended for the grill master in your life.  I had most of the tools here, but by the time I put them altogether I'd spent nearly twice as much for less quality stuff, not to mention my apron does not double as a carry case.  If you're buying a new grill online and are short of tools to start with this is a must have, be warned this is no starter set, most grill vets would love to have this by their favorite smoker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6KELIN93AVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QVQKJ2#wasThisHelpful","RC6KELIN93AVO","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I played my first role playing game in the early 1980's it was a war game and had various scenarios that pitted either the British or the Americans, or the Russians with WWII gear against the Germans.  I thought it interesting at the time how the different groups worked; the Germans had the best cover and the fewest men.  The Russians have the most men, but the worst weapons, The Americans somewhere in the middle with the British.  Each group had a characteristic that was supposed to represent them.  These were usually dependent on the dice, for instance if you rolled snake eyes, and were Russian the group of men you had would go berserk, this meant hit points and firepower would double and they would advance on open ground to your position until you killed them or they overran you.  Another characteristic of the game is you had groups of soldiers with a leader who had a name and stats.  A high enough roll against and the leader would break.  If the leader broke the men would break with him and retreat.  All would be ineffective until the leader rolled enough to rally.  If he was killed the rest of the men were useless.  Except for the Americans which had the special characteristic of rank and file soldiers being able to rally and fight without leaders.  I remember this today because it sparked an interest in these types of strategy games.What I knew at the time is I thought the calculations of the dice and other factors should have been made by a computer.  Computers at least home PC's were in their infancy at that time, but even then I thought this was a great application for them.  Still it loses something in the translation.  Imagination for one, the ability to create scenes that are interesting out of one‚Äôs own head.  Mental exercise is another, in letting the computer do all the calculations for movement, effects and kills; you give up using your mind to train that way.  Games are problem solving at this level and you gain little effect letting the computer do most of the work.  Interestingly, many early RPG's in computer or console games were turn based, and the movement static, so you could at least decide how to attack and develop a strategy with your party.  Today whether online or on a single machine, you just blast away or retreat till the monster is dead.This is a starter set, or maybe the basic set is more than that because the gameplay is complex.  I thought that maybe I should downgrade it for that difficulty, but then if you want simple, go play Diablo III or WOW.  The downside of a game like this is you do need a group of like-minded friends.  They have to be like minded to not only play these types of games but play this specific series.  Fortunately, if you have the friends you're in luck.  The Pathfinder series is very popular with dozens of expansion sets, books and models to add to the fun.  What‚Äôs lacking, I'd like to see a better system to play without a Dungeon Master.  Something that both can drive the plot, but input can maybe be put in by randomly selecting cards or having the group each select actions and shuffle them to make those happen randomly.  If you had four players for instance each would provide twenty-five percent of the obstacles, the base game might provide some that would lower that number, and overall the group would still not know what to expect when.I don't know of Pathfinder makes a real starter game for new players, maybe they assume someone new will be shown the ropes by the vets.  This is a common way of getting involved in these games, and maybe the audience is somewhat limited.  I knew about similar RPG's in college in the late 80's.  The players didn't use cards as much as books, dice, pad and paper.  Characters had a deep story and within the scope you often created your own character as a custom of some of the others.  It was fun, but there were downsides, very few were good Dungeon Masters, and everyone thought they'd created the most awesome characters and often arguments broke out that ended the game early.  Maybe card based is the way to go.  If the game is around long enough and they make limited editions, you can profit as well. Arising from the limited edition spells weapons or characters, sometimes something is too powerful, and everyone wants that in their deck.  Magic the Gathering has had cards that have sold for hundreds if not thousands of dollars.  Almost like sports collectibles, the rare cards with the best features are coveted and sell big time.Here are some suggestions, don't buy if you don't have the friends to play this.  Don't buy if your friends are not into RPG's, you won't be able to convince them to start without help.  Don't buy this as a family board game; unless your family is full of RPG loving types, it's not Monopoly or Boggle.  Do buy this if your friends play Pathfinder and you want to play host at your place.  Do buy as a change of pace if your friends play other RPG's.  Do buy if you play Pathfinder, but don't have a basic set with a large number of cards and the full dice set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISDXAGITN5DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R1ISDXAGITN5DE","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice very fast USB 3.0 Drive.  I have many uses for these drives usually involving video or animation video files.  This holds a a full 26 episode season of most anime at 24 minutes each in HD.  Make sure you have a back up though, I've run these streaming before to a file server device connected to the TV, and they get hot, sometimes they break.  I tested this one about 3 hours and it did OK despite the plastic construction.  Still long direct downloads can take days and I've lost better quality sticks that way.  I usually use a high quality multi-TB drive to get the downloads and then copy to the stick.  I think these are OK to do limited streaming off of as long as it's not a habit.  If you are going to use this on a computer, just do the transfer and let the HD on the computer do the heavy lifting to play the file.Bottom line this is a bargain for the size and speed of this drive.  Great for transporting your data from place to place, but it would not be a great drive to be a workhorse for a lot of DL direct or playing files, I just don't think the construction would hold up.

"I've started taking these for a week, 2 capsules 3 times a day.  Like most of these supplements they are no miracle substance, I can't see much difference in my normal well being.  The proof will be in the long term effects.  Should I feel something at the end of the bottle I would probably continue to order and take the substance.  This has a lot of claims and that in itself temped me to get this from the VINE, so I hope there is some good after the bottle is empty.That said, I've suffered no I'll effects, no digestive issues, gas or pains, no tendency to be tired, or weaker than usual, so I don't see any bad effects and that in itself is good.  I've had other supplements where I experienced one or more issues that I could attribute to when I started taking them within day or two, so I stopped.  Here at least nothing bad yet, but the good remains to be seen.  At this time I can neither recommend for or recommend against, but there is a time constraint to do these reviews.

"Really nice printer for an Ink Jet, it's hard to realize the value of Brother's use of value priced and high capacity ink until you've spent ten times the value paying or other printer's ink cartridges.  Many ink jet printers are fairly inexpensive.  I once bought one with a rebate that made it cost 11 dollars, I thought of buying a few more just to get the ink cartridges which cost 5 times that at the time. I remember brother printers from way back providing individual color cartridges at 8 bucks each, and you could buy only the colors you ran low on.  Brother has always been for being economical with business economics.This printer is heavy and very well made.  It is as wide and long as their expensive color laser printer but not as tall.  I reviewed that last year for the VINE, and it was an excellent printer.  This one has the same look and touch screen interface.  I was able to connect quickly with Windows 7 and was up and printing via my wireless in minutes after removing the tapes and installing the inks.  One minor thing, this is perhaps not the best if you want photo quality, even with high quality paper made for photo reproduction on ink jets, the ink is not as vibrant as the toner in their laser printer, in fact it's not as good as HP branded inks, but it does cost less and still looks very good, and most office applications are not going to suffer.Among the things that make this more expensive than the typical ink jet cheapy is the touch screen for set-up and control, the high quality scanner, the software to link with smart phones and other wireless devices, full duplex printing and a rarity among home printers paper sizes up to 11"" by 17"" or legal sized.  The parts that drop it a star, are the size for the home is a bit large, and not nearly as fast or as fine a print as the laser.  To me I'd go with the laser printer and spend the extra money, but if you're on a budget, this has everything the laser does as an economical price.Additional features include a fax, flatbed scanner, and a USB input for direct printing of documents if you don't have a network set-up.  Recommended for a home or small office if you have the space.  Takes up about the room of a 10 year old Epson printer everyone used to have in the early days of home computing, but much better quality and utility.  Note, you don't need to keep it near your PC, mine is way in the back bedroom side by side with the laser from last years review. I like both of them just the laser a bit more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYSX0VJXLRB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU7KNY#wasThisHelpful","R1DYSX0VJXLRB4","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This monitor has it were it needs to be in the viewing.  I have a Dell monitor that I bought in 2005 it was the first of the full HD monitors that made a decent price point at 1200.00 but I bought it on a discounted system for about half of that.  I liked it so much I've since replaced my PC with an upgraded one, but kept the monitor.  I've see and used a lot of wide screen monitors at work, but they didn't really impress.  This one really does, the detail was impressive.  I'm a NFL fan and my team site has a lot of videos, but I typically just read the articles, because the videos don't impress me much.  I tested this monitor out on them and I was suddenly a believer, it looked like I was looking out the window at a football practice up close, I could have been looking from a bench on the sidelines.  I even got a sense of what time of day it was with the late practice, the contrast was incredible.  From a sunny mid-day practice, to a late afternoon early evening, where a cloudy sky sort of makes things look a little dark, but sharper at the same time.Maybe there will be 4K monitors in the near future that can impress this much, but they have a ways to go to meet this price point.  Anyone with a basic laptop or desktop system can afford this and will love it for games and surfing the web.  I did not see any issues with the football action about display latency or blurring, so I'm impressed.The screen is LED back lit, one of the things people see these days on computer monitors or TV's is LED, now for the most part that doesn't mean the individual pixels are LED, it means there is a liquid crystal matrix (LCD) that requires a light to show the colors.  Early LCD TV's had a florescent lamp in the back to shine through the LCD panel and allow you to see the images.  Problem was florescent lamps do burn out eventually and then you had an expensive repair if they even had a way to do it, it was not as simple as a household bulb change.  LED's last a lot longer but are more expensive as back lights.  I don't know the exact technology this monitor uses, but some are edge lit, that is they shine light in from the edges of the panels.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of room for that here so this may be a true back lit type.  Depending on the sophistication of the software that controls them a true back lit TV can have regions that perform independently depending on the amount of light needed for the picture at any given time.  If the software for that is not done they typically do an overall dimming strategy where the LED's all get bright or dim with the general demand of the picture source.Two technologies had actual individual elements providing their own light sources, the plasma, which was very heavy and tended to fade after a few years of use as the elements wore down.  Then there is the newest technology OLED, an organic light emitting diode, this is very promising but also very expensive at this time.  For now we may have the best mix of technology for the money out there for someone who needs a nice sized monitor on a budget.  There are some issues, the stand it only tilts, it doesn't rise, which meant I couldn't use it on my kiosk without putting it on a box.  So I put it on a desk in the back bedroom to use with a laptop and put it on a large book to keep it at the height I needed.  For some reason I had trouble getting the back mount to fit all the way in and lock like it should, but that was no big problem.  I was disappointed it did not have a display port interface,,It did have and HDMI although there is no sound from the monitor so that was not a necessity.  What I used was the VGA interface, something that is rapidly going away on TV's and monitors today.  Maybe the target audience of older machines is why they did that.Despite a few short comings the monitors display is  beautiful and thats really what counts most, for the price I can't ask for much more so it still gets my full recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBEEUWLGBANS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIJLF0I#wasThisHelpful","R3NBEEUWLGBANS","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is spring now and well into the blooming season.  I have hay fever, had it since I was a boy, but despite my late parents concerns, I never took shots, prescription anti-histamines or most other treatments.  For that reason my body has adapted and I'm only mildly effected by it in late spring and late summer or early fall.  Right now I can tell because my eyes water a bit and my nose is a little stopped up.  In the past I would lose hearing in one ear or the other as a cause from pollen.I wanted to download the manual for this unit, but the CRC94004 number on the bottom did not work on the Fellowes website, I can only think this is too new for it.  So I went the other route looking it up by product type.  I didn't find it, but did find the 100 unit and it uses the exact same filters, so I believe this is basically a newer version of that.  When I first turned it on I got a strange noise and stopped it, like many engineers who have to work without a manual, I basically didn't read this at first.  I neglected to unwrap the inner filters from the plastic wrap so no air flow was getting to the unit. I put this in my main bedroom with my AC window unit and a lot of collected dust from not cleaning the room.  The air quality light came on amber, at least it wasn't red.  After about an hour and a half it went to green, I turned the unit off and turned on the window AC and went shopping, after I came back, I turned it on again and it stayed amber for about 10 minutes before returning to green.  I guess I'm pumping in some pollen, dust, and maybe equalizing the air quality of the house going in and out of the room over time.  I guess I need to fire up my other big filter on the adjacent rooms and see if this is a problem.  It's possible it's time to change the furnace filter too, I've left that in since winter.While the unit was green I sat down and watched the TV on my Roku after a few hours I noticed my nose had cleared up some.  I was breathing out of both nostrils instead of just alternating to one or the other (the body cycles breathing through the nostrils in case you didn't know).  If this works this good, I'm going to have to consider getting a bigger one for the living room.  The soft touch controls work easier on this than my other non-Fellowes unit, and it is just as quiet on low speeds, but that's not saying much because the other unit is a filter that is rated for 4 times the capacity of this one, and it does do a nice job, although I don't think quite as good with pollen.  Recommended, for hay fever sufferers and those who just like clean air in the home.  I don't know if this is a characteristic of the area or Amazon, but my VINE order went in on mid-Thursday and arrived by Friday afternoon so shipping was extremely fast.  The filters do cost a bit retail, but all seem to be on sale for hefty discounts on Amazon, hope that stays that way, but they do last a long time, the HEPA, nearly a year.  I assume that's variable depending on how polluted the air quality is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JMH27BIHRRMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31B0YU#wasThisHelpful","R1JMH27BIHRRMB","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First impressions, very heavy mount with nice fit and finish. Opens and locks in place and cable releases for the attachment grapplers, I'll call them, are under lockable doors, so no one can try and take your bike mount and all. The main holding bars can stay down as well when the bikes are not connected. Then put up and locked in place. Heavy duty straps lock down the frame across two padded us shaped holders. There is another stabilizing strap as well. A thief with a sharp knife or small cutter might defeat all this, so consider your bike chain as well to tie to the carrier. There is a caution to not open the truck, which worried me a bit since my cars have a remote, but the carrier is too heavy to allow itself to be picked up if the trunk is unlatched. I would check it though, and if worried it might pop loose in traffic, and inexpensive bungee cord might clip to the mount and the bumper to keep it down if the trunk were to come unlatched while moving.The unit came with an envelope containing a manual which had instructions for installation and use, and it also had a USB drive with some videos on it, two were similar on safety, and one was a promotional commercial, then they had a PDF format catalog of all things Thule. As I said this is very heavy and larger than too other models they have that to a similar carry job. The locking and how it's done, does look like it's easier on this, when you have the lock door open you cable release. Now pull grappler ends to the length of cable needed, and then tighten by turning the dials, locking back down the release tab, and locking the access door. The mount is covered in all area's by a rubberized plastic or flex coating of some kind to prevent scratching the paint. Still, care should be taken and if worried a few inexpensive soft pads can be stuck in ares of concern. This should be done sparingly though, the design of the unit itself was to make it not slide around, you don't want to defeat that purpose.  This supports three bikes, but in hard breaking, even tied down well I can see the bottom of the bikes move some.  I would have liked to see some optional spacers to keep bikes from too much movement.I can probably find it online, but I would have wanted to see a video of installing a high end bike and securing it to this thing. The pictures in the manual help, but not as much as a video could. I can recommend this for cyclist enthusiasts with expensive bikes. If you own a cheap bike, or just want to take junior down to the bike track, toss his bike in the trunk and tie it down with a bungee, this things too expensive to waste on that! I also don't recommend it on small inexpensively build cars, the weight is maybe too much for them on the trunk door and bumper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STN26F89RC9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M542ILI#wasThisHelpful","R2STN26F89RC9G","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somewhat heavier than I thought it was going to be.  I was wondering about the weight, the Amazon description of this said 5.1 pounds, but then it had a shipping weight of 15.6 pounds.  Now I can attest the box is very heavy cardboard, it's needed to support the dish, but it's not 10 pounds worth, so my guess is they dropped the digit when putting the product weight, this thing weights about 15 pounds with the lid, I stepped on the bathroom scale with and without it, and noted the difference.  Which is why I know my late mother would never have been able to use this in her waning years, and I don't recommend it for anyone with arm or hand strength issues.  Filled with an oven casserole or something liquid, It would be bending over to put a near 20 pound free weight in the oven.The dish itself is well finished but slightly uneven in places as probably expected of a cast iron product.  I could see when I put the lid on there are some areas around the lid where the porcelain coating is scratched.  It's hard to tell that may be mostly cast right at the seam, the coating looks shiny, more porcelain-like inside the lid, and the inner dish.  It's rough though and that's probably a good thing if the coating doesn't wear off.  The coating on the outside is either much heavier or they did something to polish the iron before it was applied.  There is a faint hammered look to the outer metal, it's smooth and shiny with the black porcelain coat, but not as smooth as an autos finish for instance, you can see a slightly uneven surface under the coating.I decided since I just got off my Atkins type diet this weekend, that I'd do the classic Au Gratin potato casserole with a bit of ham.  Now I did this for a purpose, I've had a porcelain casserole dish with a glass lid that's been in the family for decades.  It may have been good at one time, I don't know, but as long as I've used it, every time I do this casserole, I get a brown burn area about an inch so all around the inner sides (easy to see the dish is white). It takes a long soak and dedicated scrubbing to get that off, so sometimes I avoid making this favorite because I'm too lazy to want to clean it up.  The results:  Pretty good really, the potatoes with the butter added browned well on the top crispy but not burnt,  It was a little hard to tell because this is black, but I didn't notice a prominent browning ring around the inside.  This may have to do with the several large raised dots on the inside of the lid.  I expect the internal heat and steam flow are a little different for this than my white casserole dish.  It was a chore getting it out of the oven, no half measures here, I put the oven door all the way down, and used both hands.  My 'Ove' Gloves (I bought two or rather my sister gave me them a Christmas apart) was seeing the heat retention of iron as I took the dish out.  The silicon stripes on the knit gloved do not hold off heat completely, and are worthless for liquid spills, so I could feel these get hot as I pulled this from the oven.  Anyway the potato dish came out excellent and the timing was spot on for the recipe, so no cooking complaints,  I soaked it 10-15 minutes in hot water to clean and it cleaned up with a soft brush in about 5 more with a bit of mild dish soap.  I'm a fan.  It's mostly cast iron, so it does work with those induction cookers, I have one, but didn't think to trot it out. It's iron so it will work with them.Recommended, but not if you can't manage heavy cookware.  Cooks even and not bad to clean, but careful to not drop this thing on your foot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIWB47Z3S9G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS7FCUO#wasThisHelpful","R2HIWB47Z3S9G0","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I ordered these I'd never tried them before and I half thought they were gum.  Besides being tasty and my favorite flavor of the mint family, they were unexpectedly cooling.  I chewed up about five or six of them two at a time and got a nicely chilling effect in the back and roof of my mouth.  Then I took a drink of a cold iced coffee, and I had to stop mid sip, it was like I was having a combination brain freeze, but not really, and  an allergic reaction.  I had to wait a minute or two until the effect wore off before I could finish my drink.  Whatever those cooling crystals are, they really do the job.  Plus, these taste great, and no added sugar to rot my teeth.The packaging was OK, but a little hard to find the part to open it with.  Once the sealed wrapper was off, it opens like a small drawer or matchbox, and the candy/breath fresheners are about the size of a normal gum chicklet.  The box is shirt pocket size, so I can see carrying them around for after dinner type breath fixers.  If you don't like the intensity of things like Altoids, Sour Gummies, or other intense flavors, you probably won't like these, they will really clear the sinuses.  The package says to keep in a cool dry place, so I assume these can melt, and are also hydrophilic, meaning they tend to attract water and absorb it.  Recommended, for all who like intense flavors, and like the taste of spearmint.  Take care not to take with iced, or very cold drinks right after chewing these, you may not like the effect, I was mildly shocked when it happened to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WKENKRX8V1B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP6Y9LC#wasThisHelpful","R2WKENKRX8V1B7","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I attend Japanese Saturday school on the weekends, a program meant both for Japanese families with children working or living in the USA, and like me interested Americans who want to learn the language and culture.  My teacher Jun, just returned from a trip to Tokyo some months back and I brought the book to class today and showed it to her during a break.  She was impressed with the format and said she could have used this back on her trip.  It had the right supplementary information as well, and she commented specifically on the subway map and the supporting information.  A few of the attractions listed she had visited on what she called her bucket list, one of them was the Ghibli Museum a place that displays items from the many classic anime films made by the famous studio.While I know this cannot possibly include all the sites and attractions in Tokyo, it has a commendable array of them that cover most tastes.  Perfect for someone who wants to get a broad picture of the culture.  It's a good thing to have such a planner, as Jun put it, ""the city is very crowded"", and if you don't have a good plan you could waste a lot of time without getting anywhere.  There are many books specifically about Tokyo and they will give you every attraction detail and restaurant, this is a light, inexpensive guide to point you to the main attractions and gives you just enough detail, suggested times to visit, and what the specifics are.The book has an elastic strap to keep it from falling open and to preserver you daily selection for touring.  I should tell you how it works and one thing that they really did miss, but if listening they should correct in a new edition.  The book has a number of cards, each suspended on one third of the ring or coil type binding.  The top one is morning, the middle afternoon, and the bottom is the evening.  You have cards that flip in each of these positions.  When flipped the card you just flipped over will have a picture of the attraction or parts of it on the back side, so it will be on your left, the card side you're viewing on the right will have the information about the attraction.  You page through each card group and stop on the next one you want for the same or next day, and then you use the cloth bookmark to save that location.As I stated they did miss something obvious, although the book after the tri-card page section is past and a few information pages are there, they have a couple of note pages.  What they really should have done and if the author's read this, may do is provide three pages of blank cards so that we might create and intermix our own attraction choices in with the pre-printed ones.  As I said there is a lot more to Tokyo or most large cities than this book and it makes a great and uncomplicated planner for those of us who'd rather not do complicated planning.  If I find out an attraction from the hotel fliers, or the bigger guide books, I can fit it in the pocket, or write it in the notes, but I'd rather been able to select it with the morning noon and night card section.  Somehow, they missed that opportunity, but I like this enough, I won't deduct a star consider it 4.5 if you‚Äôre really counting.  Recommended, for those who are going to Tokyo for business or pleasure in the near future.  The book is light; it fit in my side pants pocket easily, so it's easier than hauling a bigger guide book with you all over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0CLNBKL1DZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607016#wasThisHelpful","R3S0CLNBKL1DZ0","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I'd have tried this first no way would I have bought it!  I guess like that game show on TV I'm not as smart as a fifth grader, cause it took me several minutes to find out how the two pieces of the slingshot fit together.  I was almost convinced they sent the wrong part, but it turned out part of the handle mold that seems like support for the grip is where it plugs in.  Then there was some sort of lock on the piece that's supposed to pull back, I would have thought it would just release when you put in a bullet, but no go.  I pushed it down with a pen tip and pulled the sling back.  It shot the Nerf bullet, but not very far and in consistent.Another thing, this has some sort of decoder thing for sending messages, but there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to create new ones,  so it's pretty lame, I don't know why they bothered with it.  The device is also fairly powerfull so if someone were to say shoot pencils instead of Nerf bullets it becomes a bit of a weapon.  Not recommended, especially not for the 8+ age group.  Nerf has so many clever things, but this needs to be pulled from the market, it's not a good one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1916YWSGK37AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBVTG1E#wasThisHelpful","R1916YWSGK37AV","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Joseph is a company that makes a lot of small kitchen hand held devices, adjustable rolling pins etc.  The 4-in-1 is a really nice idea and rendered fairly well with a few exceptions that just bother me.  I like the pounding surface for meat, in the picture I was worried it would have actual holes in the metal, and would be prone to bacteria if not cleaned properly.  To my surprise, its totally sealed, and the rough side is even rounded on the points, then hollows to minimize blood splatter.  I contrast this to my little aluminum meat hammer with sharp points, this one doesn't damage the meat.  The flat side is nice too, with ground beef, or sometimes flattening chicken breasts so they cook evenly, I like this tool.  The other two functions are overkill to me, I've got much better stuff to squeeze oranges and lemons. As a large pestle, you still need the mortar and most of them come as a set.  Add to that the pestle is typically rough so it can help grind the spice or whatever in the mortar against the mortars rough edge.  The top of this thats supposed to do the grinding is smooth.  Maybe they intend you to crush things with the top not grind them, but if you hammer down on a mortar to many times it's likely to break.I have another worry that I can't substantiate without breaking this unit.  the handle has a seam and is hollow plastic.  Hammering on things is stressful to the hammer, and the handle picks up a lot of the shock.  As an engineer, I've seen may things tend to break right at the seam,  This should have been either steel banded around that weakness, or made the plastic not hollow, or at least much thicker.  Maybe it will hold up, but I occasionally wale on things pretty good, so if fear this could break if it gets a hard hit.  I do like the function and utility of this device, so I give it a fairly high recommendation, it's not perfect by any means.  It will be nice to have in my home kitchen.  One more thing, if you do a lot of BBQ outdoors don't lay this on the hot grill. I don't think the plastic will resist that much heat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TTBU4QHTW4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R86CW0K#wasThisHelpful","R19TTBU4QHTW4S","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough about this blower, when I note that the number one blower sold out there on Amazon is a Toro, I have to wonder why.  People will pay 2K or more for a lawn tractor, but the going rate for leaf blowers price point is about a hundred bucks.  Why buy a 300 dollar unit then.  I put it to you this way, whats your time worth?  This device blows leaves and dirt like nobody's business.  I'd have killed for one of these as a teenager when my dad made me sweep the sunken back porch and patio area once a week.  The concrete area was 22' by 28' and took 20 minutes with a push broom even when the leaves and dirt were light.  I guarantee this would have done it in 5 minutes, and I'd have had fun doing it.This Oregon is a cannon to the others pop guns, the amount of air moved an the right controlled speed is the way to move leaves and other trash.  They ship this with the biggest battery available, it costs 135.00 for just the battery, so it has the power needed to feed the beast, and the beast will clean your yard fast and without back breaking effort.  The handy shoulder strap is comfortable and suspends the device at the perfect height to herd things along.  This will clean the patio, the wood deck, the garage floor (watch for blowing spiders), the back of the bushes along the house, and of course the yard.  While it doesn't have one of those fancy gutter clean adapters.  Climb the ladder in the middle of the gutter length point it one way and hit the turbo button, then point the other way and do the same.  Unless your house is more than 50 feet wide, there won't be much left in the gutter after it gets turbo'd by this cannon.I have a Sears shop Vac that has a plug in blower that snaps off the top.  It has 269 MPH wind, but on top of having a cord to deal with, and even with a fairly big opening similar to the Oregon, that wind just tends to get in the way, the leaves go up in the air as does the dirt and dust and some earth you didn't want to move.  Get the good one that works and will almost do your job for you.

"I'm not much of a movie maker, but I've worked with some animation sequences before to create game objects back in the late 90's and I can see that the technology has come a long way since then.  Back then part of our training was to learn how movies were made and our instructor was a second tier television director named Patrick.  He once posed the question as to why most European made movies looked so much different than American made films especially with the night scenes. One of the reasons was using filters, you could film on a bright sunny day (as long as you kept the sun or it's reflections out of the frame, and filter down till it looked like midnight.  The difference was in real night you could barely see the actors, but in this filtered dark they were clear while still in a night scene.  You can do similar effects with the FX tools in this software and it looks very good.One thing I heard from other reviewers was that they took out the Blu Ray burning support that was in version 7.  I don't like it either when people drop stuff they used to give you, but this is not exactly a Turbo Tax crisis.  For one adding support for higher resolutions, and a number of easy interfaces for sound and sequencing is a lot more added value than you get with you're typical tax software update.  Second, not everyone has a Blu Ray burner, I for one do not, so I hardly need the plug-in right now.  Third, if you really need it, the cost is $7.99, so an 8 dollar upgrade is not that much of a hardship.  They held the price of the overall software, improved features and performance and separated a feature not everyone needs as a small added expense.  I'm not certain, but it's possible they may have to pay royalties to Blu Ray, or some other third party for the plug-in, so why pass the cost on to us if we don't want it.  It's like CATV, why am I paying for regional sports or a package with the golf channel, it's mainly because the CATV company won't separate them from the tier.This software practically makes the movies itself, and I think there is a tool that even does that to some extend.  Recommended for the video novice like me who doesn't make a habit of creating films, but may want to make an occasional demo.  I think a pro would want something with more flexible feature and less automatic parts to do his own creation, and their are far more expensive packages out there, but this one is not bad for most of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RUZA6IXL4IOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J9E#wasThisHelpful","R2RUZA6IXL4IOU","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great pizza peel, I saw a few reviewers that said it was too flexible and the pizza may fall off.  Either the product improved or they are lifting 20 pound pizza's.  I putt 10 pounds of loose printer paper on this, if it flexed I'd have a bunch to pick up, but I carried it around the house and tilted it slightly, bounced it and nothing.  Remember this is for a 12 inch pizza, the oven it was designed for was an outdoor gas BBQ type of oven and it lends full support for that.  It won't matter what 12 inch peel you use if you are taking a 16-20"" monster out of your oven, that can slip off one this size, but if it's crisp enough on the bottom, I think even this peel could remove it.I needed a new peel because the wood one while OK dumping off pizza's on my pizza stone in the oven is so thick it's oven me trying to pull with a fork to get the pizza back on after it's baked.  I've burned myself a few times and once let go the peel and the pizza landed face down, no five second rule here, I tossed it in the trash after I scraped up the melted cheese off my floor.  No problem with this pizza peel, it gets right under the pizza.  I sometimes make my own pizza, but, mostly buy Papa Murphy's fresh or ALDI fresh pizza's both very good for home baking.  I did the testing with a Papa Murphy cause it is very flexible out of the pan till it bakes.  It worked great, so I can do away with using their throwaway cooking pan which didn't work well on my stone.  On fresh dough you still need to flour it a little, but slips in easy, and slides out just as well.  (No double meaning on that dialog!)  My wood peel did not fold so it hangs on the wall and this one fits in a drawer or can hang, because it folds.  Nice handle, good riveting to the handle and a snap in and out break down of the handle, rubber piece has what seems to be a full metal tine with the Cuisinart logo in the middle for support.  This is OK for slightly soft crust 14 inch pizza's that's what I baked, 16+ may be pushing it, but it will hold the weight fine.  Highly recommended for those of us who want better cooked pizza at home or like to do it yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFYRI7UQUD98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5PY2#wasThisHelpful","R1VFYRI7UQUD98","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very easy to read prose, and a story that starts out immersed in the action, and draws you in quickly to hold your attention.  The book is told from two perspectives, one of a female scholar, who is allowed to escape through the action of her brother, and now wants to free him from capture.  The second perspective, a lead soldier in training with the oppressive government, and the son of one of it's main oppressors.  He wants to desert, although what he would do then, would be questionable, even to him.  The book makes it obvious both of these people will eventually intersect, and they do.  They both provide aid and opportunity to the other, that neither could have mustered alone.Still, I have a problem with this book, maybe because it doesn't state at the beginning it's not self contained.  The conclusion makes it obvious there will be additional books.  If only to complete the story.  I don't mind books that largely complete the story they sought to open, but this book is not one of those.  Other than an improbable union of the characters, and the changing of their lives as expected in most books, the story does not even solve an interim conclusion. It even speaks of hopelessness to some extent, but then promises to carry on.  I don't like to reveal endings, but this really didn't have one.  It's nice that authors would like their own best selling series, but that to me is more about a strong character and and overall setting.  You should conclude what you have at hand.  Honestly, if I we're the author, I'd ask a few focus groups these kind of questions and if it comes out like I think it would, I'd hold the presses, and rewrite the ending.  There's gonna be more to tell, but they should tie up what what should have been promised from the start.This is the first time I've ever rated something this high that I won't recommend.  If you buy it it will take you on the journey, but then you'll have to wait, hopefully not too long, for the next book.  Joss Whedon, gifted writer and director, understands something about the audience that this author does not yet get.  We don't mind teasers to let us know what the next big challenge is, but we balk at leaving all the loose ends hanging for a long time.  Whet the appetite for the next meal, but please don't leave us completely hungry and unsatisfied at the current dinner table.  Not recommended, unless you're a masochist, or perhaps a sadist who buys books for their friends, and then tears out the last pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JF8SY2JGZHI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148035#wasThisHelpful","R1JF8SY2JGZHI3","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all Kazoozles the product this was when made under the Wonka name were great.  A genuine gummy texture on the outside and a grainy filling with a pleasant tart and sweet taste.  Somehow it seems like that product would be closer to what the Sweetarts name stands for.  These are not that good.  I can understand the disappointment in those who bought them thinking they were the original.  I once bought a box of 1800 suckers because I thought they were the type my workplace had been putting out in the candy bowl.  I liked them because they had some tartness and a strong flavor.  Unfortunately, by the time I'd bought them another company was making them and they were mostly sweet with a generic flavor.  They were likeable still, but I was disappointed.  I gave most away for Halloween that year about a handful per each kid.All that said, these are good in their own right.  A texture between the gummy and a gum drop on the outside, and a tasty tart filling on the inside.  The graininess is gone, but the taste is good.  The coating is not as strong a taste as the filling but neither overwhelms the other.  I ate three packages before I knew it.  FYI 4 ropes equates to a can of soda worth of sugar, so don't veg out on them, I essentially drank three cans of Coke without the caffeine!  I like them better than red vines and the new Twiz with the fillings.  These are softer and easier to eat, and the flavor is solid.  No they are not as good as the original, but they are definitely worth getting.  If you've never tried the original and love fruit candies, you'll probably love these.  The right dosage of sweet and sour.  If you were a fan of the original, try them with an open mind, there's a lot worse candies of this type out there.  Recommended for candy lovers of all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4JO5GDJ6EDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HMZ004#wasThisHelpful","R2F4JO5GDJ6EDH","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every house can use an info area a place to check to see where others went, what time a future appointment is, what is the address of the party, or what we want to include in the latest grocery list.  Yes I know we have cell phones, computers, PDA's, address books, and other methods. Still a nice low tech method everyone knows to come to is sometimes the best way.  My email only works if I remember to turn it on and check it, I forget my cell phone or the battery runs low, I can't always find my address book, and it's easier to remember doctors appointments when I see the dated more often then when I put the appointment card in my wallet.  This is a nice board stickpins work easy, and it looks similar to the material in my office cube.  I've mounted it in a central location so I can use it to notify the person who keeps watch on my house while I'm working away on contracts, and its convenient for me when home to remember my weekend agenda's.I recommend putting this in the kitchen area if you have the free wall space, but away from the stove or oven.  It would pick up grease there.  I remember that from a rental I had that I got a lot of greasy books on a nearby bookshelf by the oven.  On the other side my books were fine though.  Like any other reminder device it's a good idea to take down the outdated stuff frequently, and also to put up things like frequently used or even emergency phone numbers and locations that can stay on the board.  If you have older kids, it should serve to have an area where you say where you'll be and they should do the same.  I'm an engineer and a techie, but I can definitely see that in some cases low tech is still the best, don't get caught up in everything should be electronic, it has changed the way we live, but is not always the best way for everyone.Recommended for everyone who needs an info reminder station in their home or business.  Tech haters will love it and even the techies will find a lot of use for it.  An inexpensive way to keep yourself posted!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8ULB57KWBHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I9W7#wasThisHelpful","R2B8ULB57KWBHP","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I might be somewhat disappointed in this, but was pleasantly surprised.  I guess we could consider Hoover a good company when it comes to things that move air quickly and intake it efficiently.  I had made some comparisons with the amount of air filtered, and some other units prior to receiving this, so I thought this might be a bit weak.  I was also wondering why there was no germ killing UV light as some other Hoover models have?  These are things I got past when I realized how nice this unit really was.Now there is a downside, it is a big unit, you can stand it up or put it on a table or desk on it's side.  If you have a tiny home or apartment, it is going to take up some space.  The footprint is much larger than a lot of the stand-up tower units.  In relation to power, size may have it's advantages.  I picked a good day to open this up.  I was cooking an Irish favorite corned beef hash with eggs on top and sourdough toast.  I also made a side of home fries with a chopped yellow onion browned in butter.  The smell covered three rooms in my house and was especially strong in the kitchen and though I vented it on the stove.  A strong odor of fried onions till remained.  I decided to set up the Hoover.The first test was the different modes, in the low, I could barely hear the unit standing right next to it.  I tried medium and it was audible, but not bad.  You could definitely hear the high, but still not as bad as the noise from my oven overhead fan on my over the stove microwave.  I set the timer for two hours and left it on high.  Prior to that it had been two hours and the room still stunk of onions.  When I came back I could barely smell them, just a faint hint.  Another thing about high with the unit on the floor blowing air up I could feel a tremendous volume.  It would make a good cooling fan to stand in front of.  That gave me an idea.  It was still cold outside, maybe the last day or so this late winter.  I had a room edition in the back of the house that's a very large bedroom and attached bath.  It only has one heating vent and it's never enough to heat the room, yet my front two bedrooms get overly warm.  I moved a small decorative table and put this right next to the incoming heat vent.  I put my key shaped thermometer on the other end of the room and checked the temperature, sixty one degrees.  I set the Hoover for two hours and left, when I returned in ninety minutes, the temperature was up to 66.5 degrees.  The air mover is so strong on high it can suck the heat right out of the vent.  I know they have special fans for that, but this gave me a way to do it without having one installed.Pros:Very Quite Operation on the lower settings.Can be used horizontally or vertically.Large volume of air moved and cleaned on high setting.Can help extract heat from an underperforming heat duct.Came with an extra main filter.Would make a nice cooling fan on hot days.Has a 2, 4, and 6 hour timer setting.Has a filter replace light.Cons:Unit is very big.Mode lights are dim and hard to see in a lighted room.Does not run without one of the timed settings.Has no UV light to kill germs.Does not have an ozone ionizer.For what it is, I discount cons unless one is particularly needed or not desired.  Great air cleaner and odor remover.  Seems to have multiple uses with the great airflow.  Highly Recommended.  I couldn't select 41/2 stars so I had to give it a five.  It deserved that exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SN2O04R2OYOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFEY45A#wasThisHelpful","R2SN2O04R2OYOM","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Their are some similar recent anime series that have a good deal of similar humor, but the plot usually boils down to something more serious.  The Index series for instance, or the currently playing Maria the Virgin Witch.  It's priceless to watch the hero, (a girl) who has followed the devil and his devoted follower to this dimension, try to spy on them.  She manages to overhear just enough to think they are hatching some evil plots, which turn out to be, either going to the bathhouse, or standing in line at the grocery to get a bargain price on eggs.I'm sometimes stuck about the Japanese overall view of the Christian religions as often times they become the heavy as with this kind of anime.  That plotline is easy enough to forget here, but as I said demands more attention in other recent anime, Spice and Wolf comes to mind.  Here it just works enough to drive the humor without the heavy hand in those other series.Other parts of the humor expose some of the lacking in our own children and the mundane menial work they often distain.  The Devil shows that diligence and proper dedication will typically result in moving up the ranks quickly and not becoming mired in the low end of the business.  It is a subtle lesson, and it should maybe be taken to heart by some of the target audience of this series.  Sustained humor in anime is hard to do, I've known some series that bored me long before they reached the halfway point.  This one does it well, but would probably not be sustainable to have sequels.  Hayete the Combat Butler, only existed as long as it did because it used parody of a number of other anime series to create and sustain that humor.  Fairly original humor is hard to find, but there is some of that here, and more than enough to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC3LO6VWS6278/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKT890A#wasThisHelpful","RC3LO6VWS6278","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now its hard for me to say if the lack of cushion support is due to the thickness.  It's possible this would not be comfortable if it was an inch thick, and the composition may need a foam center.  I can see it's durable, but to put my knee on the floor, I need a support that allows the knee to sink in a little without feeling like it's gonna break.  I've used pillows to get up off the floor, and obviously the mat is not going to be that thick, but I think if it were a bit thicker with a little more play, it might be workable.  I've over 300 pounds, so this just won't work for me.  I actually put the mat near the basement entrance in the hall of my home, so if necessary I could stand up by putting my feet down the stairway.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what I had to do.Good points, as I said durable did not slide very much on the carpet, easy to roll back up and store away.  Not recommended for very heavy people, maybe they should make a thicker version for my type.  For the average size person, I'm not sure this would be comfortable for doing sit-ups or back exercises, but it's probably not bad for the intended Yoga audience.  The width is a plus, and it would be easy to take with you to a class or some such thing.

"This is the third one of these kind of trimmers I've owned and the best.  The other two used a round shaped head that generally pulled on the nose hair when inserted.  It was not easy to manipulate it either, so generally I just used it to trim back the protruding hairs.  It would not do eyebrows or mustaches either.  This one is different, Norelco took the time to design something safer that would not pull, and could be rotated around for a good trimming. The guard makes it especially safe, although it tickles enough to cause a sneeze if you are not careful.  I had nose surgery (outside) last summer, they cut a deep divot to remove a basil cancer cell.  It took months to heal, and I opted not to do any reconstruction.  It healed fine, but the opening is smaller for one nostril and the inside tissue thicker.  The guard works great because I'm pressed up against the skin, which would not be possible with the old types I use.I used to use a small sharp pointy scissors to trim the brows.  I was always cautious that I did not stick my eye when using them, and it was hard to orient them in the mirror, especially when switching hands.  This trimmer does it right, it's easily controlled so it doesn't over trim, and it does the job quickly and evenly.  I now no longer have to wait till I get a haircut to get the eyebrows trimmed right.  The only downside and it's minor is this doesn't fit in one of those little grooming kits like my others do.  It will fit fine in my normal shaving kit, but it's considerably larger than most nose trimmers I've seen, but that is not really a bad thing.  Strangely it doesn't cost much more than the cheap ones I've had before.  Recommended for a number of good reasons, it's about time they upgraded this kind of thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1VJIOQF2O1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTA8O#wasThisHelpful","R3G1VJIOQF2O1Y","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a long time since I took the SAT exam, back then it was two sections a Math and a Verbal, and though not easy not much diversity.  It was criticized back then for being biased towards certain races and income levels who did not have middle class educational advantages.  Today the SAT has three main sections and added verbal analytical part and apparently as this book details some optional Subject Specific Tests.  The book suggests you contact your college choices to see if they review or require you to take a specific subject test.  On of the things that surprised me is that the Mathematics subject does not include Analytic Geometry or Calculus.  The higher scientific, computer, and engineering based degrees in college will all require quite a bit of that level of math. Maybe it has changed, but shortly after I left High School most of the schools adopted Calculus as a standard college prep subject.  Anyway, it's not covered here, but that may be unnecessary for the exam.The book really does cover all the bases with test prep, what to bring, what kind of calculator to use and why, and had a good deal of information on stress management.  Even so far as the proper foods to eat when studying or preparing for the test.  Although they put it a different way, what was said in my day is still apparently true.  If you're still cramming at the last minute, you are not going to perform as well as if you studied hard and then got a good nights sleep before the exam.  They compared it to an observation by a Jeopardy champion, who watched prospective players who talked and crammed facts in the waiting room, vs the quiet reserved ones, who ultimately would do the best.  Still means the same thing, learn don't burn, cramming at the last minute to try and commit to short term memory everything you should have studied last week.Recommended, an invaluable aid to taking one of the SAT's subject exams, probably one of the most useful ones in predicting future college performance as well in any of the technical or even business type degrees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZ664ZPS5S3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618658417#wasThisHelpful","RIZ664ZPS5S3R","A39LRLKACX89IP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39LRLKACX89IP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now, the ""glasses"" themselves; The magnification is tremendous, and clear, IF you have what you're looking at within an inch of the loupes. Any further than that and they have zero value.

It worked wonders on cellulite and really smoothes out and firms the skin like nothing else. I've tried creams and lotions but they're all just a waste and don't even compare to this.

"I recently started out in the corporate field and see myself remaining there for some time. It has its ups and downs like anything else. When I came across this book I decided to give it a shot. Ended up loving it! I loved the approach the author took, it's genuinely humorous yet provides valuable insight and advice. Stories drawn from actual experiences add a very personal and relatable touch. The contrast between the corporation's goals and lives of employees is quite stark and was definitely interesting to read about. But the good thing is that this book provides real tips on surviving and striving for success in a touch corporate world. Definitely recommend this book, you won't regret reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7G4UR5OQ72RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNMWZ3U#wasThisHelpful","R7G4UR5OQ72RF","AV7C3HFB1OE51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV7C3HFB1OE51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've purchased quite a few bands lately for my Apple watch but this has to be my absolute favorite! I got in color ""black"" and it's just so nice. I love the finish and it looks so expensive when in reality it is not that pricy at all. Multiple people have asked me where I got this particular band, they couldn't believe it was readily available on Amazon.The band fit my watch perfectly and it was easy to switch out. The fold over clasp is very secure and firm making sure the watch stays in place and doesn't fall off. I like that the strap is adjustable because I had to shorten mine (which was easy and fast). The design is beautiful and materials used are high quality. Definitely recommend this band!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BC5M5ZJ26FPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFM2N0S#wasThisHelpful","R2BC5M5ZJ26FPF","AV7C3HFB1OE51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV7C3HFB1OE51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this band for my Apple Watch and very happy with it. I wanted a band that would look professional and not so sporty and this was just perfect for work days. Plus it's fun to switch out the bands and have different ones on anyway. This band fit the watch precisely which I was very happy about. The quality of this band is superb. Made out of stainless steel, it pretty much doesn't get better than that. It is very safe and secure on the wrist which I like because I don't have to worry about it falling off.

The twisted design is perfect, makes it for a very durable and sturdy cable. I absolutely love the sound with this, it's very clear and crisp unlike many other cables I've used.

"A super cool gadget. I had issues with heart palpitations so my doctor ordered me to measure my pulse throughout the day. I decided to get this meter to help with that so I wouldn't have to do it manually. It's extremely accurate with depicting the pulse and blood oxygen which is my favorite part about this product.

"This mattress is pure heaven! I was pretty skeptical about buying a mattress on Amazon but I'm so glad I took the chance and got this. It worked out so very well for me. First of all, I loved the quick and free delivery. The mattress itself is so comfortable. It's just the perfect amount of firmness: it's not too hard where it's not comfortable and it's not too soft where you just sink in. They found the perfect middle between the two.I had minor back aches (which is why I was looking for a new mattress) and this definitely helped with that. I wake up well rested because I don't suffer from discomfort throughout the night anymore. Lastly, this mattress is made in the USA and I tend to gravitate towards those kind of products because they are of higher quality (typically). This mattress is definitely of an amazing quality, I was not disappointed. Highly recommend this, amazing seller and amazing product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOQ0HXQ6XP1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZIRPZVE#wasThisHelpful","RFOQ0HXQ6XP1X","AV7C3HFB1OE51","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV7C3HFB1OE51?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air filter is great. I was very happy with its quality. I didn't expect much from it but the quality definitely exceeded my expectations. With using this air filter, I'm maximizing the air flow to my engine which is not only beneficial for its torque and horsepower but also protects the engine itself from overheating. The materials this is made of are extremely high quality and very durable which is nice because it will last a long time.

They say what happens after dark stays there and yes it so does.This book is truly awesome like no other book I've read before, excellent writing, connection to the characters completely unique plot, suspense, love and gave me the feels!!!!This book in my opinion is Jaden's best work to date, you need to one click this amazing freakish book!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SPWK8KHWGYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B018A9FZ8E#wasThisHelpful","R39SPWK8KHWGYH","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 Stars but so very nearly could have been moreThis is one of those times, having read the first book, that I really wondered what could possibly happen in a sequel. I kind of liked where the first book ended. Having said that I did think that this second book could perhaps give us, as a reader, the closure we didn't necessarily get from The Summer Remains.Now I have to say this is an extremely difficult book to express how I felt about, because in order to do that, I'd have to reveal a major spoiler that happened in book one. And because I can't do that I will say this, it is a book about love in its most pure form.The first few chapters take place shortly after where book one ends, however it soon began to take a completely different direction, one I certainly didn't expect.Initially I wasn't sure why the author took the story in this direction and I wondered how it could possibly work, but surprisingly it did in places, but I felt it was a little far fetched in others. After a while I began to think that the story was dragging and I found myself losing interest for a time, only to have my attention grabbed again. And so this was pretty much what happened for me throughout the book.For me much of this book was a little too 'wordy' for my liking, causing a lot of my attention to wander occasionally and that's where I realised this book could have been so much more had it only been condensed a little.Sadly I wasn't blown away like I was after reading The Summer Remains, but I am happy the author did decide to give us this sequel and it will be interesting to see what he comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4X2K0Q5G9KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016P6K7KK#wasThisHelpful","R3P4X2K0Q5G9KN","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, I have a confession to make. I couldn't for the life of me, remember what happened in book one and having no time to re-read I began to panic, thinking I wasn't going to know what was going on. Well quite honestly it didn't make the slightest bit of difference.One line.......One line from Rebel was all it took to turn this book from brilliant to, dare I say, the hottest book I've read for a while. Quite honestly the man is sex personified. He's just the right amount of badass, incredibly protective, highly intelligent, seriously good looking from all accounts and that filthy mouth of his is enough to turn a nun. I, quite frankly need a Rebel in my life, preferably in a horizontal position, but I'm really not fussy **wink wink**. The man just is the perfect package.In the same way one line took this book to a whole new level, another line was all it took for everything from book one to come flooding back to me, a bit like a eureka moment.Now I know I loved the first book, but this one was something else and once again Callie has tied up just enough loose ends, but leaves others dangling to make you want more. I'm also going to be quite controversial, I imagine when I say this, but I'm almost certain that this series just has the edge on The Blood & Roses series, or at the very least Rebel has the slightest margin over Zeth. But to be fair, I'd take either of those hotties.I know I'm going to be thinking about this book for a while and the only bone I have to pick is that it has possibly ruined me for any future reads, because right now I'm just a little too obsessed with the rogue that is Rebel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTBM88L612BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0182RBPSI#wasThisHelpful","R3QTBM88L612BZ","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series, it is so different from anything else I have read, it is flawlessly delivered, and I am sad to see the series brought to a conclusion. This is the third book in the series and you really do need to read the first two books to understand the story.†At the end of the last book we left Jane devastated at the realisation that her partner and friend was not who she thought he was and on her way to undertake another mindrun to try and find answers the questions as to who Rory was. However, Rory was as gifted in this area as Jane and when she enters his mind space the answers continue to evade her and more questions arise. Jane comes out of this mindrun feeling confused and questioning those closest to her but are things as they seem or did Rory just plant the seeds of doubt. Once again the author delivers a brilliant story that leaves you feeling like you are in a hall of mirrors and every turn and twist bring new questions.¬†As Jane begins to look for answers she slowly unravels a web of lies that is her life and who she really is, with devastating consequences especially for her relationship with Dash, just as they seemed to be moving towards marriage. Jane returns to her career and along the way learns the truth to many secrets and sets out to get justification for personal wrongs and to forgive Dash for his involvement as the two finally get their HEA together.A fantastic series from an author that is now a firm favourite of mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B51Y12BB3OFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SXET78#wasThisHelpful","R3B51Y12BB3OFB","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 StarsThis is the story of Harley, who has, by her own account, spent much of her life being let down by people. It seems her love life has been following the same pattern, until one day she decides she needs to move away and make a new start. She meets Fox who offers her a ride to Sea Whisper Island.Sadly it took me a while to connect with Harley. She spent a large portion of the book, adamant that everyone, especially Fox would let her down even though it was clear Fox was perfect for her. The 'whole world is against me' thing got frustrating eventually and for such a short read I'd say she was like this for approximately 85% of the book.From the beginning I loved Fox. He was mysterious at the beginning, with the perfect amount of Alpha male-ness, but at the same time he was caring and never gave Harley any indication that he would hurt her and I think this may be where my frustration with her stems from. However once Harley came to term with her issues, the chemistry between the couple came clear and I finally understood what Fox saw in her.I would have loved a lot more of the antagonistic characters to have played a bigger role. One in particular seemed to appear as though she was going to create all sorts of problems for Harley and Fox and just as quickly she disappeared. Perhaps she'll have a more significant role later in the series.There were parts of this book that I guessed quite early on, but overall I did enjoy it and even though book 2 focuses on a different couple, there is plenty of story to continue with.All in all this was a good start to a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQ22GAHLJTXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSNXJ9E#wasThisHelpful","RMQ22GAHLJTXT","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5* I'm still brooding stars.In this book we have Scarlet, she's been through something that's very deep and personal. She closed her self off to everyone in her life. She thinks the further she pushes people away, from family to friends, the less chance she has to feel anything.That is until she meets Theo Saxon.Theo is her new boss at an underground gambling society. Theo is a man of little words, but big on brooding.There's this instant spark between these two, it builds til it explodes.I loved everything from the cover, characters, and even the plot of this book. It went places I wasn't expecting and just when you thought that something couldn't get any worse it did.A good bit of the story revolves around Texas Holdem, even if you're not a person familiar with the game, the author picked a brilliant way to explain it to get the reader familiar with the aspect of it.Then it came to the ending, let me just say I hope Ms. Allison is plugging away at the keys to get part two out.This was my first time reading this author and I would read her books again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQKPWEDCNPRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AE41YU#wasThisHelpful","R2WQKPWEDCNPRF","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Amazing stars!!!I really loved the UnLove Me Trilogy boxset, which follows six friends on their rollercoaster of a journey through friendships and relationships. This is my first time reading anything in the MC genre and I can't wait to read more! I read this whole series in one weekend and was sad when it was over! This trilogy will definitely give you one hell of a book hangover and you might just need a few tissues throughout. You will want to throw your kindle or paperback across the room and yell at the characters to get their acts together. I went through so many emotions while reading and it was well worth it!UnKiss MeWe meet Jasper and Eden, Vinny and Lilly, and Mason and Hilary in this debut novel of the Angel Warriors MC series. They have all been close knit friends since before high school and they have gone through most of life's struggles together. This first book is from Jasper and Eden's perspective. We learn that Jasper 'Angel' Hughes is apart of the Angel Warriors MC, formerly known as the Satan's Law MC. Him and the guys are trying to clean up his father's mess and turn the club around to where they actually have a good reputation, instead of being known for booze, drugs, guns, and girls. Eden on the other hand is trying to get out from underneath her father's abusive hands. A total misunderstanding and Eden seeing something she shouldn't have causes her to run away and stay gone for years without letting anyone know until she finds out she has a sister who she has to go back and protect. When her father goes to prison for trying to kill her, she is finally 'free'. But once he is set to be released, she hesitantly calls on the Angel Warriors MC for protection, not knowing that Jasper and the rest of the guys were the guys behind it. With Jasper back in her life, Eden suddenly has to answer for herself and why she ran away without a word, also try to keep the rest of her life changing secrets from him. Will her secrets tear them apart forever?This was my favorite out of the series! I loved Jasper and Eden and their connection and relationship.UnTouch MeWhen Eden's secrets all come, Lilly has a lot to answer to from Vinny. She knew where Eden was and even kept in contact with her and she never told any of the guys. Jasper was Vinny 'Zippo' Torino's best friend and he feels betrayed by Lilly from keeping that from them, especially since they could have really protected and helped Eden against her father. But Zippo has secrets too, and they would absolutely destroy Lilly and make her leave him forever if she ever found out. Lilly and Zippo have an on and off again relationship with a lot of 'cheating' on Zippo's part. This was my least favorite book of the series. I could not stand Zippo and his way of thinking and personally don't think Lilly or any girl should have stayed with him.UnBreak MeThe third and final book of the series is told from Mason and Hilary's POV. Mason is the bad boy of the group and the one who took Satan's Law which was under Jasper's father Vic's rule at the time seriously. He followed everything Vic told him to do, even murder and sleeping with hookers, even though he had Hilary. Although he changed his ways after the changeover to Angel's Warriors took place, I believe he still had a very heavy conscious of what he did in his past. This took a huge toll on his and Hilary's marriage and caused him to become abusive, both verbally and physically. He even accused her of cheating, even though he was the one stepping out on his wife. This caused Hilary to leave him and not return for nine years. She finally returned when Eden needed protection, but her and Mason's relationship was more of the same. This book will definitely break you and I highly recommend you bring tissues along for the ride! I hated Mason throughout this book and he was always the one I was really curious to know more about, but I think I understand him and his broody ways more after reading his story.This series was amazing and you have to read all of them, and in order, for you to really understand and to get closure. Each one ends in a cliffhanger that will have you reeling and ready to dive headfirst in to the next book! The UnLove Me Trilogy is filled with secrets, danger, murder, suspense, raw passion, tears, anger, and everything that makes a book great! This was my first time reading anything by the author and I can't wait to read more of her work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5KE7EB43DGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508674728#wasThisHelpful","R3M5KE7EB43DGP","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a stand-alone made to a series of different side characters.In this book we have Phoebe, she's just came back to Lover's Leap. She's independent, fun and spunky. After losing her sister, she decides that time is too short to waste, so she makes up her mind about going after her best friends brother Colton.Colton has had lots of struggles after being discharged from the military due to an injury. Colton has been training to get back in the military and prove everyone wrong that thought he was down and out.Some parts of the book were over descriptive, but otherwise, it flowed well and there were some really silly fun times. If you've ever heard of the book, Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day?? If you have, that constitutes Phoebe's life as the adult version. Once her and Colton get together the sparks fly off the pages.This is my first time reading this author and I really even liked the side characters too, so I would read the next books in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OT96YOKUXRXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FYM8T6#wasThisHelpful","R3OT96YOKUXRXQ","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wowzers I think I am in love with this author.Reap is the 2nd story in Tillie Cole‚Äôs Scarred Souls series and you definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed as it‚Äôs simply amazing. Subject 221 aka Zaal has been a prototype for the Georgian Bratva, being a prototype for their obedience drug. 221 has no memories and is used as a killing machine for his master the Georgian boss Jakhua. After being freed by Luka ( aka Raze ) Zaal is taken to a safe location to be chained up until his memories return, Luka frees Zaal because he promised his best friend he would seek revenge on their captors (you need to read Raze book 1 for that story). Luka happens to take him to a place where his sister Talia is residing on a break away from mafia mayhem. This is where Talia starts to care for a very broken and confused Zaal but can it ever be anymore as both their families are actually enemies and such a relationship would not be approved off. Can love be on the cards and will Luka and Zaal get the revenge on the Georgian Bratva that has wrecked both their families lives? Read this book you won‚Äôt be disappointed.I don‚Äôt want to go into anymore story detail on Reap as I fear spoilers may be given. Tillie Cole has a knack for originality in her books and knows how to draw a reader in. Reap is a story of Fear, Control, love, anger and broken spirits. It‚Äôs a dark read due to the enslaving and violence. I loved the twists and turns it had, just when you think it was over it begun again. I wanted to pull Zaal out of the book and give him a big fat hug. Zaal had been through hell and back since he was 8 years old and his story needed to be told. I can‚Äôt wait to see whats next after reading the epilogue although my lips are sealed and you will have to read to find out. Thank You Tillie another wonderful read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V9ZDZ36UBOHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5LN4#wasThisHelpful","R1V9ZDZ36UBOHS","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The blurb for this story had me very intrigued and once I started reading, I was not disappointed! I was completely captivated and finished this book in one whole long sitting. I loved the characters, the storyline, the emotions it invoked; I just loved everything about this book.I loved the connection between Sloan and Luke, although the author made me slightly dislike them both in the second half of the book. You will be rooting for them both to get the happily ever after that they both greatly deserve. You will laugh, yell, and possibly even cry throughout this book.This book had everything I love and want to see in a book: thought provoking characters, a romantic beach city, and a never ending love story that prevails through anything.I fell in love with Luke first since we got his POV in the beginning. Even though the author labeled him a manwhore, you could tell there was more to the story than that. He had a broken home life and a less than supportive mother. He had to support her and raise his little brother. I love how Jamie Howard made the characters more than they seem. Sloane sees right through Luke's manwhoreish ways and holds him to a higher standard.Like all great romances, we are torn apart when the couple is. Something completely tragic and unexpected happens that tears Luke apart and he can't find a way to move past it. Feeling like he isn't good enough for Sloane, he does something he immediately regrets but hurts Sloane in the process. You will cry and possibly need tissues! I was so emotional at this tragic event and cursed the author, and contemplated throwing my kindle at the wall I was so upset. But I was captivated and read through till the very end!This is the author's debut novel and I can't believe I have to wait till March 2016 to read more of her great writing skills. You will be taken on a roller coaster of emotions and experience everything the character's are and this is something you want in a good romance novel. I wish I could go back and experience it all for the very first time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A5NTZ8YZW8UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122VFFB8#wasThisHelpful","R1A5NTZ8YZW8UF","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was instantly drawn in by the intriguing blurb and title and I was not disappointed! I found the title to be absolutely perfect for the storyline the author went with. I loved Keegan and Aimee and their whole relationship and connection. They are one of those couples who meet at a young age and you are just rooting for them to get their happily ever after. I read this in one big long sitting and was absolutely captivated with the story.I loved this book and the only reason why it's not receiving a 5 star review is because I found the characters to be a bit weak, especially the hero, Keegan. I don't want to share any spoilers but he let a single small mistake break apart a decade long friendship and broke all contact with Aimee for eight years until she was assigned to write an article on him for the paper she worked for. He let this one mistake rule his life and almost cost him his chance at redeeming himself with Aimee. Other than that small fact, I found Skyscrapers and Camelot to be captivating and held my attention from the title page all the way to the last chapter.This is the a new to me author and I cannot wait to read more of her work! While reading this book I was unaware that it ended on a major cliffhanger so I kind of caught off guard by that and now I have to wait two whole months for the sequel! Just be aware that this book DOES end on a cliffhanger! I definitely do recommend this book for those looking for a sweet, complicated friends to lovers romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4132UT1IS1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011APUSQY#wasThisHelpful","R2S4132UT1IS1C","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsThis is the debut book for this author who shows great promise. It kills me to have to give this book an average rating as the writing is good, witty and humorous however there was too many holes in the story for me to ignore and the conclusion left me somewhat baffled. The characters required more development as they were quite immature which in the first part of the book I expected but not as they became adults. Though I did enjoy the witty banter and attitude of the lead character.Mia and Dean‚Äôs story begins in high school where she is the geeky artsy nerd type and Dean is the star jock type, after Dean begs Mia to help him with his grades the two quickly become more as Mia sees a different side to Dean. The two find common ground in their unhappy home lives yet all along I kept waiting for the moment that this was all a play by Dean to humiliate Mia but when the fallout came I was just left thinking WTH. I was devastated for Mia and wanted to strangle Dean for his behaviour towards her.The story moves on ten years and Mia is still as witty and at first seems to be getting on with her life but this is where the story became a little sketchy for me. There were just too many areas where I kept questioning the reasoning and coincidences to just accept the storyline. We catch up with Mia as she is at a crossroads in life and decides to return to her passion for art as a career choice, a decision which brings Dean back into her life. And I just wanted to strangle him all over again. The actions of Dean in the role of career he has chosen just didn‚Äôt gel and when we finally learn of the reasons for his behaviour I was once again left thinking WTH. The one section that we heard from Dean just brought us a mature adult that was supposed to be a policeman carrying an unjustified grudge and sounding like a petulant teenager still, though his story was sad I still don‚Äôt think his actions as an adult were ever justified.Overall a promising first book from the author that I will certainly not hesitate to read again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0B1GVYAC2BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165WFUKG#wasThisHelpful","R1N0B1GVYAC2BW","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! That was a tough book to read in so many ways, but I mean that in a really good way, so please don't let that deter you.This, the second book of the trilogy, is basically The Man I Love retold in Daisy's point of view and this alone had me doubting whether it could possibly be as good as the first. I often find these types of books add very little to the original. However, where this book succeeded, was probably because of the fact that there is such a long period of Daisy's life we knew very little about and because of what she went through and what I knew was to come, in some ways made it difficult for me emotionally.It begins with Daisy reliving the day that finally turned her world upside down. And in many ways it was hard to relive everything leading up to this point and the years after. She is finally seeing a therapist, so a large portion was switching between certain periods of time.At first I found myself thinking that I didn't really care what Daisy was going through, I loved Erik and nothing was going to change that. What happened though was I found myself empathising with her and wanting to shake some sense into Erik. I understood a lot more what led Daisy to make what was to be her biggest mistake.Now whilst I didn't experience the same rush and scale of feelings as I did with book one, I did sense that this was much more than a retelling of a story.By the end I was an emotional mess and I have to say I much preferred this ending to the first, if that could even be possible. Maybe that is because, selfishly I wanted more Erik and Daisy and most of this book was about Daisy and her relationship with the people in her life and how she dealt with what happened all those years ago, but the ending just did it for me and has again left me wanting the penultimate book three, that we sadly have to wait until January for.I'm not totally sure what genre this series falls into, but my first thought is it's New Adult, but if you want a book that is so much more than a romance, I highly recommend you read these books because I can pretty much guarantee you'll be affected by these characters, just like me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OVK35PTPVQTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0ZF7MK#wasThisHelpful","R1OVK35PTPVQTZ","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking forward to this book so much since reading the amazing Carnage series and the author did not disappoint. This is another emotion charged read that certainly requires tissues to hand but also hilarious in parts and at times I was crying and laughing at Marley. A brilliantly executed book and I loved the style in which Marley‚Äôs story was delivered as a book within a book.I am just in love with Marley after reading his story, from the start you learn how much he loves his family with a passion and though we learnt in the Carnage books that he made some bad judgements as a youngster he has worked hard at correcting his mistakes. I loved how within Marley‚Äôs story we also got Maca‚Äôs story and how he was faring after the fallout of the devastation of his relationship with Georgia.†Marley certainly lived up to the rockstar lifestyle and I loved reading of his exploits around the world as he lived up to the Carnage name of his band, mainly by himself, and pulling a heartbroken Maca along with him. His guilt at his involvement in Maca‚Äôs situation was obvious and left him torn between his family and friend which I hadn‚Äôt understood before but really seemed to define Marley as a character. The fallouts from his antics that had Len his brother and band manager picking up the pieces after him until he met his match in Ashley had me chuckling. I love Ashley, she was no pushover from the start.It was great catching up with all the characters from the Carnage series and seeing how life was treating them too. I could carry on telling you the numerous aspects of Marley‚Äôs story as I loved everything about this book. A brilliant addition to the Carnage series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303HCO1MIQD4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AUJFXU#wasThisHelpful","R303HCO1MIQD4M","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this boxset of the Calling Me series, a set of three books that delivers a lovely story of lifelong friends moving on to a relationship together. I‚Äôm so glad I waited for the complete series before reading as I‚Äôm sure the cliffhangers between each book would have been torturous.Calling Me BackWe meet Luke and quickly learn that he has issues with making the big commitment of marriage but is that just because he hasn‚Äôt met the right person yet‚Ä¶..or has he? Luke and Ash are lifelong friends that are already more than friends, they are family and as his sister‚Äôs best friend Luke doesn‚Äôt see Ash as anything different. Ash though has long since accepted her love for Luke will remain unrequited. When Luke‚Äôs current partner throws down a relationship ultimatum his life begins to spiral and he questions everything he thought he knew and wanted in life as he begins a new phase. Ash is there to help Luke through and suddenly things change as he realises she means more to him than just a friend but can he act on his thoughts. A drunken night out ends with a rather hot night of passion and Ash is left feeling that she may have made a mistake in being Luke‚Äôs rebound.Calling Me AwayAsh makes the decision that as much as she loves Luke that moving on to a relationship may not be the best for the friendship they share and especially her friendship with his sister. So she tells Luke he has to take the time to find himself before jumping into another relationship. This book had me on edge as I wanted these two to work things out and every step they took further away from each other had me wanting it more. Ash had me so frustrated with her back and forth thoughts and she started to do the damage to the friendship‚Äôs herself that she feared a relationship with Luke would. However, it was good to see Luke discover himself as a person and realise the things that had been holding him back. I was happy to see he realised that he was as mad about Ash and ready to fight for what he wanted.Calling Me HomeThis was a perfect ending to this series as Luke and Ash begin to develop their relationship together. I loved how different Luke was as a character from the first book and his obvious love for Ash. As the relationship suddenly changes and Ash once again questioned if Luke was ready for the next step he was fantastic in showing her that he was.A great read and my first by this author and I look forward to catching up on the rest of her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PREPZPG2Z00H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TOECMW#wasThisHelpful","R2PREPZPG2Z00H","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsThis book is M/MWhen I read the blurb, I was excited going into this one.Then the Insta love hit fast, quick, and hard. I was worried then as that's not my thing.But this book also had a topic of dialysis, and that hits very close to home for me. So of course I kept going to see where that went. I'm so glad I did. I fell in love with Marcus and Trevor probably as much as they did each other.Trevor, has a decision in his life to make. To fight or to give up. Once he meets Marc, while snowed in during a blizzard, he starts to evaluate his life even more. He wonders maybe he could have hope, instead of his life living in nothing but black and white.Marc, he has the decision to either keep fighting for the light in his life, or stay behind in the dark.Just when I thought I had things figured out to where this story was going, it went into a different direction. I read this short book in one sitting, I had to know what was going to happen. Especially after the hot and steamy connection these two have.This is my first book from this author and I can't wait to read more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPFRSKBMC004/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GHTD3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2QPFRSKBMC004","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure where to start with this review because there are so many angles to approach from in reviewing this book; the even more than expected style of writing from the author, it's complex subject matter and characters and the overall message it delivers. This is a YA story, maturely delivered that deals with the matter of sexuality and gender labelling at the core of the story, for me I think this is a book that should be read to really understand the issues faced by those that those struggling to find their identity and label. It is loosely connected with Black Iris in that certain characters crossover into this book, but it doesn't have to be read to understand Cam Girl.I loved the character of Vada and I loved that with a character that is an artist that Leah was able to add to her already colourful way with words and loved the artists notes to certain scenes in the story. Vada is a complex character with a multitude of issues, her heritage, her overbearing mother, her refusal to accept her sexuality, her need to please her family, her refusal to let anyone get close, she is a difficult character to connect to but for me her story resonates so much.We meet Vada and her best friend Ellis in the midst of car crash during which Vada is seriously injured threatening her passion for painting and any future as an artist. So we watch as Vada slips deep into a spiral of depression during which she pushes those she loves away both intentionally and unintentionally. In the midst of her depression and as she is on the verge of losing everything Vada encounters a couple that offer her the opportunity to escape her life. It was difficult to read through the low points for Vada and it really made for intense reading.And so Vada embarks on a career as a Cam Girl, the scenes while sometimes difficult to read gave a good objective view of what being a cam girl is like and that the lifestyle can sometimes be cathartic and empowering for the girls. As she settles into her life as a cam girl her past and the many questions surrounding the car crash that altered her life are a constant reminder of what she has left behind until her past catches up with her. Vada finally begins to face up to the many issues in her life but it seems that things begin to get more complicated as she tries to find the answer she needs to move on, but it seems Vada has as many answers already that she just needs to finally acknowledge. But will Vada finally stop running from the issues in her life and accept herself as she is?I loved this book and I found it quite emotional reading at times and was left quite awe struck by the story as a whole.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQBY5NMF1FRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI124#wasThisHelpful","RKQBY5NMF1FRZ","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying this hugely anticipated book is, no question, my favourite so far this year, but Griffin Hancock, what have you done to me?!?It's been a while since I've had a book hangover of this proportion and I certainly didn't expect Griffin to be the one to do it and send me from laughing out loud to moments of heartbreak and uncontrollable sobbing. It's what I can only describe as one heck of a roller coaster ride.I expected laughs and I definitely got them in spades. There were times when I couldn't read on for laughing.This book is told entirely in Griffin's point of view and if you thought you knew him from Kellan and Keira's books, then you can rest assured his thoughts are even more crazy and outlandish in this book. His ego is larger than all the other D-Bags put together and some may say he is selfish and inconsiderate, but despite his faults I found him to be totally, sex obsessed, endearing and quite frankly adorable, even though I'm sure he'd prefer the phrase 'Sex God', in fact there are so many adjectives to describe the man.If you are expecting this book to be along the lines of Kellan and Keira's book then think again, because the humour alone in this book set it apart from the rest of the series and whilst his relationship with Anna plays a big part, its also his relationship with the other members of the band that is the focus.In true SC Stephens style......WHAM!!!..... she tears out your heart (at one point making me reconsider my fondness for a particular band member) and piece by piece puts it back together and that to me is a sign of a truly brilliant author of any genre.Kellan will always and I mean always have a special place in my heart, but I think there's more than enough room enough for Griffin 'The Hulk' Hancock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9LJ03418M3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE8K9Q4#wasThisHelpful","RS9LJ03418M3D","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really am finding it difficult to express what this book meant to me in a way that will do it justice. I can honestly say, hand on heart, I don't think I've ever been as truly engaged in a book as I have with this one.At the beginning it took me a little while to grasp the lingo, especially because ashamedly I'm not familiar with any aspect of performing arts, but I quickly got into the swing of things and the fact that I now know what a pas de deux is, amongst other ballet words and phrases, has me thinking I really want to watch a ballet performance, but really that isn't even the start of what I loved about this book.Erik, meet Daisy. They're soul mates, but love never runs smooth in the world of fiction, so what we have is one event that spirals into a multitude of things, causing both Daisy and Erik to make huge mistakes that will irrevocably change the courae of their lives. I'm talking edge of your seat stuff at times, theoretical screaming at certain characters because you know they've made the wrong choices and you've no idea what's coming next.There is sensitive subject matter that some readers may be put off by, but I felt it was handled with care and dignity and dare I say beautifully.I truly loved Erik. He was the strength within a small group of students. The way he and Daisy interact and are so open and honest with one another was completely refreshing.Daisy was a little more of a mystery to me and even though she was to blame for a lot of things that transpired, I really felt that she had paid the price needed and hoped and prayed for a happy ever after for the couple. Do they get that? Well you'll have to read it and find out, because I can honestly say, if you love a beautiful tragic love story, then this one will be for you.For me, every character in this story had a purpose. Every plotline had a purpose. It was incredibly well written, to the point that I forgot about reality while I was engaged in the book and that for me is key.Despite this book being split into sections and each section being dedicated to a particular character, don't presume that it is told on multiple points of view as this is solely Erik's story. Also each chapter is given a title and stupidly I looked and thought I could decipher what would happen, but let me tell you I was wrong most of the time. I couldn't have anticipated half of what happened in this book.As I mentioned, I was totally engaged in this book. Beautifully intelligent is the only thing that springs to mind, but really those words just doesn't do it justice.I'm hoping book two will be equally as stunning as the first and cannot wait to dive straight in, I'm talking shut myself off from the world again and taken on another journey as amazing as the one I have just been on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFOQXI4YL5AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2H6CSO#wasThisHelpful","RVFOQXI4YL5AL","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, this was just one of those books that sounded so good in theory, but just didn't translate well into print.Here we have Hunter, who for what I can gather, is a photographer of erotic images of women, with a secret Erin has yet to discover.The book starts with a prologue that never really gets explained in the book, although I assume it will be at some point in the series. Nearly all of the book is from Erin's point of view, but then there are a couple of chapters in another character's perspective and I'm not 100% sure who that person is. I mean the ending may have explained it a little bit but I do feel a little more clarity is needed, especially considering this is such a short book.The story felt choppy, flicking from one scene to another, for example, in one scene Erin is in a waiting room, but it doesn't explain what she's there for, because the last thing we read was that she fell asleep in Hunters bed.There is some improvement needed throughout with the sentence structures, which I feel would have helped make the story flow better.I also couldn't get a sense of the characters personalities and that actually made it difficult to warm to Hunter. For me he needed to be likeable in order for him to be able to get away with his actions and demands from Erin. He employed her as his PA and virtually straight away insinuates he wants more from her.The word 'Love' is also mentioned and I never actually got any sense of the love, lust maybe, but definitely not love. Again I think this all boils down to not feeling the character's personality.The sex scenes, for me, were a bit of an anti climax (excuse the pun), because the few scenes that there were started out good and by the end I struggled to work out whether either of them had had an orgasm or not.I do feel the idea the author has tried to portray is a good one, but I'm afraid this book has left me with too many confusions and sadly not the urge to dive into the next book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK08UKK61XJ36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LIELV8#wasThisHelpful","RK08UKK61XJ36","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first witch paranormal read and won't be the last!!! I've read about vampire's before so I couldn't wait to get started and I wasn't disappointed!!!Arden has recently lost her mother and her father has just informed her that he's accepted a job near the beach as he thinks a fresh start is what they both need, Arden comes round to the idea and starts to think she could make a fresh start in her new school but things go from bad to worse as the school bully takes an instant dislike to Arden and attacks her in front of the whole school and no one intervenes.As Arden finds making friends hard she thinks of a new hobby to fill her time so starts Surfing on the way back on day she finds an injured animal and takes it to the local vets this is where she finds out her life isn't so normal and she has powers not only that but witches, vampires and trolls exist and her life is in danger and needs to fight to save it.Overall I really enjoyed this book, Arden was ballsy and stood up and fought for what's right, the storyline was really good even though it was slow paced in the beginning but the pace soon picked up to the point I couldn't put it down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1XVDIVSNQX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGT1O0U#wasThisHelpful","R1L1XVDIVSNQX0","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another excellent read from Tess Oliver!! This one was a bit different to her usual stuff, there's more intrigue and suspense, lots of mystery going on. And of course there's one hell of a hot romance going on and a scorchingly sexy alpha male hero, this is Tess after all! Boy does she write a hot hero well!I really enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down, I just HAD to find out what happened to Tashlyn and her dad all those years ago.This story is about Tashlyn who lost her dad when she was a child to a trucking accident leaving her an orphan. She was raised by her hippy aunt in a commune, and now at 23 she's returned to the town of the site of her dad's accident. She needs answers, not least to how she came to be wandering around the forest as a lost and scared seven year old child on the night of her dad's death. There she meets Jem Wolfe, town bad boy living under the shadow of his family's bad name. She warned about him, told if she's any sense she'll stay away, but she's drawn to him and feels a connection to him right off the bat.This story intrigued me greatly, as did the characters. Other than the main characters, Dane in particular piqued my interest. I'm wondering if he'll get his own book, he's a bit mysterious and it's evident he has some difficulties and issues, I'd love to read more of him.I definitely recommend this book, those of you who have read Tess before will know she can do no wrong when it comes to her books, I've yet to find one I haven't loved. Those of you who haven't read her yet, well why the hell not?!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5K6MOWU0EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163PV8K6#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5K6MOWU0EE","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paranormal Romance is where my obsession with reading started so I had high hopes for this book, especially as it was from an author, who in my opinion has produced some amazing books in the past.I'm not totally sure what to make of this first book in the series. I admit I'm not overly familiar with M/M books and whilst there was some incredibly hot scenes in this book, I just found it hard because the vampires in this book have very little feeling towards anyone and for me it is all about the romance.The vampires co-exist in the human world, but it is clear they are very different from humans. Sex seems to play a big part between the species and it is clear they have no inhibitions. I have to say they are more animalistic compared to other vampire books I have read. This all leads to one conclusion and that is considering my lack of experience with M/M books, this is what stood out the most for me. It was almost like being a fly on the wall watching them together, which is a totally different experience to what I'm used to from other books.There also seems to be a hierarchy of vampires that reminded me very much of the Volturi from the Twilight series.I would have loved to know more about the vampires, in a biological sense. I get that they are turned by other vampires, but it is not particularly clear how this is achieved. A little more clarity of their back story would have made this a much easier read. I also wasn't too sure about who the vampires needed to feed from, because they seemed to be able to feed from both humans and vampires. Is blood needed to survive? What happens to a vampire who is starved of blood? Hopefully these questions are answered soon.Most of my issues with this book were because of personal preference and the lack of detail for the vampire species as a whole. I have to admit it was well written and in a sense I cannot fault the flow or execution of the story and the scorching sex scenes were definitely a bonus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPAASL2VXVXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122DD7HU#wasThisHelpful","RUPAASL2VXVXU","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second and last book in the Rouge Passion series and bloody hell, I was hooked! Although I really enjoyed book #1, this second book was brilliant!It picks up right where we were left off in book #1 and Isla cannot believe that she's been duped again! Worse still, she feels like the bad guy in this situation, her own nightmare turned reality. Feisty as ever, Isla is determined to make someone pay and she knows just how she's going to do it.However, once her temper is set alight, it has some far reaching and mortifying consequences and I've got to be honest, I was just about on the floor with laughter at times.Once her temper settles to a simmer, will she be able to listen to the reasons or will all she hears, be excuses?This is a real rollercoaster and I've got to be honest, at times, I wanted to slap Isla but throw in a mega-bitch and my blood was boiling!¬†Of course I still had the deliciously dirty Xander to set my blood on fire for a whole different reason...he is still hot, hot, hot!¬†Ooh! There's a huge tough ex-marine too...just in case your hormones weren't already raging!So now the fight is on. With exes, bitches, bimbo staff members, a back stabber or two and some of the most panty-drenching sex scenes you'll come across, this is a definite must read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPXY2RP0DW0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYST3EC#wasThisHelpful","R2GPXY2RP0DW0I","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsThis is one of those books where I went in with absolutely no expectations and came out the other side thinking WOW!Levee is a huge pop star who has it all, but behind the scenes life has just taken its toll, to the point where she considers taking her own life. Luckily for her she meets Sam on a bridge in San Francisco, who I have to say is my ideal book boyfriend.I loved the authors writing style. The characters personalities, especially Sam's, really shone through. The change in points of view were clearly defined leaving no room for confusion as to who's thoughts we were reading. I also felt that it was refreshing to have the female of a book be the musically talented one, instead of the hot rocker type books that frequent mine and so many others Kindle.I cannot do this review without mentioning Sam a little more, because he was so sexily adorable, if that's even a phrase, but it seems the best way to describe him because he is simply the perfect blend of hotness and caring in the way he is with Levee. And despite not actually being a multi platinum recording artist myself, I really could imagine myself in Levee's designer shoes.The sex scenes were way hotter than I expected (probably all thanks to a little piercing, which I have to say is virtually a recipe for a great book in my eyes), but what made this book for me was the couple's emotional chemistry and witty banter. It was literally love at first sight for them both.This was my first book by Aly Martinez and I have to say I shall be definitely looking out for her books in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YB5K7PS8HS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176JLJDE#wasThisHelpful","R7YB5K7PS8HS6","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I read the blurb for this book I was really excited, but unfortunately about 1/3 of the way through the book started to fall a bit short for me and it just wasn't grabbing my attention as much. I'm a reader who needs the angst, the drama, and this book didn't have enough of that for me.We have Laurel, she's in between teaching jobs and needs a way to get the rent paid til fall classes begin. She's also been best friends with April since college who also happens to be Micha's (our main character) sister.Micha is an enforcer for the mob, a partner in the bar called The Alibi, and a single DILF.With the help of April, Laurel gets a summer job being a nanny. Yes, the live in Nanny for Micha.The story started off with Micha on a job for the mafia, after that we don't get anymore of the glimpse into anything else he deals with, besides the bruising after effects.He talked of the danger he could always be in from his 'boss' and nothing of that was ever shown. In any mafia story I ever read or watched, it's once your in its for life, you get out in a body bag. Micha's father, he was out alive, which leads me to believe they are not so powerful for all the mentions of everyone's safety. Yes, I know it's fiction, but that part of the plot didn't really fit in with the story.Then we have Laurel, she's described through and through as the goody-goody, it was just hard to relate to someone with no flaws.There were a couple of discrepancies in the plot which were a bit confusing and there was a lot of description of the characters going on which I felt took away from the flow of the story.The sex scenes could be overly long in parts, I love a sex scene as much as the next girl but there's a fine line where it starts to feel like they are taking over the actual story and I did find myself skimming some of the sex scenes in this book.What I did like about this book, Micha with his horrible childhood was doing the best at making sure his daughter knew she was the light in his eyes. No matter how bad of a person he thought he was, he never let that reflect with his time with Shae.Laurel, the way she came in and, even though at times was so unsure of things, spoke her mind when it came to Shae. She put all her issues aside for that little girl who has never known the love of a mother.The editing was just about flawless in terms of grammar issues.If you're looking for a book low on angst and a quick read, you'd probably enjoy this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJZNR0HOKPT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDG3BW#wasThisHelpful","R1WJZNR0HOKPT7","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôve loved all the books in Jacquelyn Frank‚Äôs ‚ÄúImmortal Brothers‚Äù series but I have to say that this one is my favorite by a mile. I wish I could give it six stars! The two main characters alone are worth the read. Jileana is officially my favorite heroine of the year. Her unfiltered and joyous antics made me laugh out loud many times. Her vivacious nature is contagious and you can see that she brings joy to Jaykun and his brothers, who honestly can be rather dour sometimes. Jileana also has a serious side; if she wants something then you better not get in her way. Jaykun is perfect for her since he possesses a rather sly sense of humor that gets amped up when Jileana is around. The chemistry between these two was electric. I really think this book is the hottest book in the series‚Ä¶so far. The emotions between the two characters are charged and full of thrust and parry. Jaykun‚Äôs interactions with his brothers and Jileana‚Äôs relationship with her family give you further insight into how wonderful these two characters are and how perfect they are for each other. As usual Frank‚Äôs writing is top notch and keeps you riveted from the start. This book was the perfect mix of action, chemistry, and amazing character development.†","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16P5U1BE40F8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT33FQ#wasThisHelpful","R16P5U1BE40F8E","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, this certainly caused a tear or two to be shed. It's not a heart-wrenching read but it does tug at the heart strings.Grace and David meet at a very young age and although there's not a lot of back story, there's enough to set the scene and cement that there's more to come.I found the first half of the book slightly on the slow side but it spans a few years and is understandably slower as you get to know the characters.The second half definitely picks up and there's plenty to sink your teeth into and I found myself enjoying it more.The two sub-characters, Ian and Jade, are brilliant - I'm sure there's a story there to tell.There are a few minor editing issues but given that this is an ARC copy, I'm sure they'll be picked up before being published (and if they're not, there not severe enough to detract from the story).All in all, an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AF1NDTPER563/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J7ASI6#wasThisHelpful","R3AF1NDTPER563","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 StarsI really struggled with the rating on this book.I really liked the story, but I just couldn't get past certain things.This would be a really good book for 14 to 17 year olds (as long as they know better than to follow some of the examples set in this book).We have Raegan, she's very mature and such an old soul for her age. She's lost a lot in her life and has only had one person to depend on since she was young, her granddaddy. She's his whole life and vise versa.Then we have Emmett, he once lived in town but moved away and came back years later. Also his step-brother Cole, he's older and works on Raegan and G'daddy's farm.What I liked about this book??The characters, they acted at times older and not so over dramatic about the normal teenage things.The story itself was fast paced and keeps you wondering, I read it in one sitting.The editing is almost flawless.What I didn't like...¬†The Emmett parts, 80% of them are a retelling of everything that has just happened.There were so many contradictions throughout. Here's some examples:We have Emmett, who is supposed to be a senior, saying his arm is missing playing football and he'll have to wait til next year. Wouldn't he already have graduated??Then we have Reagan's truck. It's white with pink letters in the beginning chapter, then blue in the later chapter.Then we have Granddaddy who gets out a gun if Emmett gets her pregnant, but offers him a sweet tea after Emmett was drinking moonshine and had driven her home.There's no sexual scenes in the book, but a few party scenes where underage kids are drinking moonshine then driving.At one point they argue over who's better off to drive after a fight, but not because they were both chugging down moonshine. I just can't see why this character would put herself in that situation, specially since a car accident is what changed her life in the first place.This is my first time reading from this author. I received an ARC for blog review, and the formatting was way off, so I then got another and it was still off with broken words at the end of almost every sentence. I'm not sure if the Amazon copy has the same issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26W332FFXEHSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG3F32E#wasThisHelpful","R26W332FFXEHSY","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the blurb of this book, I jumped at the chance to read it. I did think how terrible of a person Evelyn must be, to be in love with her best friends husband, but once you get into the story you realise it isn't really like that, yes she loves him but it's a secret she keeps to herself and definitely would never do anything to hurt her best friend, even if it meant that ultimately she would lead a life without love.I did end up loving Evie, even though I thought I wouldn't even like her. She was so sweet and my heart broke for her. She was the most selfless person ever, even though it meant that she was unhappy herself. She kept her dying best friends wish, not wanting to hurt her even though she was gone.Devon was a bit of a tool in places and I wanted to give him a slap, but then I remembered that he was grieving for his wife so let him off a little bit.This book was nothing like I expected and I love when I can't predict what will happen. The writing style was fab and I got lost in the journey that the author took me on.I highly recommend this book and I will definitely be checking out other books by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O9ZLGRDREBHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GAHA1U#wasThisHelpful","R2O9ZLGRDREBHV","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/4 starsThis was a very good contemporary romance. The storyline was unique with a kindling work romance between the plastic surgeon and the natural beauty. I don't think I've read anything quite like this book and I was very much intrigued and brought in with the blurb alone.The only problem that I had was that the heroine, Ellie, was just a little too weak and insecure for my liking. I like a strong heroine who knows her worth and doesn't take anything less than that and I felt like Ellie was always putting herself down and thinking that she was inferior to all of her coworkers, who obviously took advantage of working in a plastic surgeon's clinic.This is a standalone novel that is very intense and quick to read. You will fall in love with Julien and Ellie and want to read more about them.Ellie Hartley is sweet but slightly insecure, especially after accepting an intern position in LA at a prestigious plastic surgery clinic where she feels she doesn't really fit in. But at first sight, the prestigious plastic surgeon himself, Julien Berthou, sets his sights on the natural beauty who he sees as complete perfection. He will do everything in his power to make her his, but she is the first woman to ever refuse his advances. He may just have to change his tactics since she is unlike any woman he has ever been with in the past. As with all great love stories, you have undeniable sexual tension, ""one hot wet dream"", exes trying to get in your way, and misunderstandings that try to break you apart, but will love prevail in the end? Lets hope so! You'll just have to one click this book to find out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILWEJLHUH5ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QOO7NK#wasThisHelpful","R3ILWEJLHUH5ZN","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't even know where to start! This book was was a bit of a mind f*uck to say the least. It keeps you guessing right to the end and you need to be prepared to be blindsided by the multiple twist and turns. I like a story that keeps me guessing, a plot that had me trying to figure out the mysteries unfolding, I enjoy trying to guess where the story is going and I particularly love it when I'm totally wrong, I enjoy being surprised. This is definitely one of those books where you'll change your mind a million times of where you think the story is going. It gives you information in dribs and drabs, you start as clueless as Maya as to what is going on and you learn a long with her, which I think is a very clever way of story-telling, it keeps you totally glued in to the story, and I was really invested in these charcters.Nikolai is a really interesting character! My opinion of him changed along the way almost as many times as my guess changed as to where the story was going. He's a very complex man with multiple sides to his character and he's holding many secrets that will shock the pants off you.I thought this book was very cleverly written and it was clear that a lot of research had gone into it. Nikolai is a highly skilled doctor with the ability to make people forget, to bury their memories in their own minds, and I was so impressed with how this was written. Kudos to Rachel Van Dyken, I was totally absorbed, and also a little creeped out!Since this is a spin-off to the Eagle Elite series, (it's totally stand-alone and you don't need to have read the Eagle Elite series to read this) which I have not read, this has totally made me want to read it! Those Italians have me intrigued!Another five star read from a brilliant author who has shown she can write bloody everything exceptionally well.

"WOW! This book had me hooked from the start and wanting to know what the hell was going to happen. The story is told from Trina Grissom aka Samantha's POV and Mark and a few others have a chapter in there. Sam has had a hard life and you get to understand why she changed her name and disappeared from the first page and from then it flows well through the whole book. She is a great main female lead and Mark is strong but serious, he's a St Clair, a well known family in the small town that Sam moves to. Mark sadly lost his wife and now looks after Emily his daughter. The writing style of this book is set in both present and past however this doesn't get confusing like some of the books I have read, the chapters flow together and you can picture the story easily. writing style for me worked well as you got a little off each character, more so Sam due to her past life but I still felt you got equal measure from Mark and what he was going though. The other people in the book, Carter (the brother who will make you laugh and shout), Luther (well what can be said about him apart from everyone needs him in their lives), Mercer (the sister that could make friends with anyone). You meet all these people throughout the book as they all stay close together. I'm really hoping there is going to be other books with their stories in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6PL4TQCIEMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BTKLEO#wasThisHelpful","R1V6PL4TQCIEMV","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the Choices trilogy and I urge you to read books #1 (Never A Choice) and #2 (Always A Choice) first.I'll try not to reveal any spoilers in this review but there's so much that happens in the first two books, that I hope you'll forgive me if I hint at something inadvertently.So, upon starting book #3 I was filled with anxiety and a little peeved to be honest. This only worsened as I read on. I became so frustrated with Bethany. I honestly wanted to slap some sense into her! What's the female equivalent of ""growing a freaking pair""?!Although Daniel is a bit of a bastard, you can't help but love him and his sense of morality in trying to do the right thing. Even if it doesn't always go to plan.There's drama, stubbornness and a whole heap of emotions thrust upon you.¬†I can quite honestly tell you that I reached a point where I was almost too afraid to keep reading. Nothing seems to be going as I expected but I did continue, with bated breath.This conclusion to the trilogy takes you on an emotional journey and I'm sure, like me, you'll swing back and forth between loving the characters and feeling utterly frustrated with them.If you've got as far as reading books #1 and #2, no doubt you're on the edge of your seat, waiting to get yours hands on this, book #3 and you won't be disappointed.¬†If you're reading this review but haven't had the pleasure of meeting the controlling, alpha that is Daniel yet, go!

"This is book #2 in the Choices trilogy and you must really read book #1 as this follows on from there and as such, this review may contain some spoilers, although I will do my best to keep them to a minimum.Ooh! I loved this book! There are more ups and downs than a twisting roller coaster.¬†Bethany has been swept off her feet and although things haven't always been smooth sailing, things are looking up...if only she can get the dominant man in her life to relax his iron fist slightly.Although I liked Daniel in book #1, he really comes into his own in book #2. He's sometimes a little too forceful but in his heart, he does all he does because he cares.Bethany has her own ghosts and issues to overcome but just when things seem to be going so well, she gets thrown another curve ball. Her self-sabotage threatens to end things for good but she under estimates Daniel's tenacity.With outside forces interfering, her own issues become less all encompassing and it looks like they may have reached an impasse.There are some editing issues in this book but as this is an ARC, I'm sure they'll be ironed out before the book is published.With the way things have been left - with a heart-stopping conflict - I can't wait to start book #3 (The Only Choice) which is ready and waiting for me to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ACKEAAWWA0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXQUW6C#wasThisHelpful","R21ACKEAAWWA0J","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 stars**Please make sure you read More Than Water before you start More Than Kisses**I loved catching up with Foster and EJ in this novella More Than Kisses, their relationship has gone from strength to strength and are now engaged!!The books starts off with them participating in a holiday progressive dinner party with their close friends, they start at Wolfgang's and wow EJ gets a shock when she goes to find Wolfgang after letting herself in to his home, the scenes that follow are really funny, we catch up with Chandra and her boyfriend Jeremy, Graham and his very pregnant wife Lilliana.We see the undeniable chemistry that brought this unlikely pair together through all things nerdy and of course the sexual chemistry, only downside was it finished, I really enjoyed catching up with all the characters and really hope Wolfgang gets his own story told.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31Y7J6XSP8GT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OYCGRQ#wasThisHelpful","R31Y7J6XSP8GT8","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahhhhhhh Ash Fuller is back in all his alpha male stroppiness with his animalistic sex and his beautifully dirty mouth. I loved getting to see more of the Ash we fell in love with in Beat after seeing his softer side in the last book and the author didn't disappoint in throwing us back into the angst of Ash & Ren's relationship. And the hot hot animal sex was off the scale too.Ash and Ren are moving on with their relationship and tentatively taking the step into living together in the apartment that Ash has lovingly built for them but as with all relationships the next step is often a very shaky one. I loved that this episode wasn't all hearts and flowers as that just isn't Ash & Ren. So while I hated what they went through to get to a happy place I loved the journey they took to get there.Poor Ash is having doubts about his ability to make Ren happy and he feels he has to face his past to be able to move forward, the stupid stupid man. At the same time a newcomer is making eyes at Ren just as the wobble in their relationship hits adding to the unrest Ash is causing. Poor Ren I really felt for her and wanted to clip Ash about the head, even when he had the chance to tell her his problem I felt he let her blame herself, such a bonehead. The result is a complete unravelling of everything they have built together and the fight of their lives to rebuild it again. However when the cards are down, Ren steps up and shows Ash why they are so right for one another I just loved the ending I really want to say the best ever ??????? in a book but I really don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave you guessing but I was just laughing out loud.It was great getting glimpses of the other characters in this series and Amity has cleverly paved the way into the next book. Spike pretty much brings Ash& Ren's story to a conclusion but I'm sure we'll see more from them in the planned books. A brilliant addition to the series, that I am totally hooked on, and I am really looking forward to the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3W5OU44PZ1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HF99AE#wasThisHelpful","R3J3W5OU44PZ1N","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On The Run is Kyle Summers story and written in her POV.Kyle has grown up with laid back hippy parents and lived the normadic lifestyle, she's traveled and been homeschooled.I found it to be slow paced at the start as there was a lot of Kyle's background story,but it soon picked up the pace when she is offered a position in the all girl group soon to become Vagabonds.I really liked Kyle she was a good strong willed character and had a no nonsense attitude going on, didn't suffer fools lightly, I found this refreshing.We have a behind the scenes of what it takes to be in a all girl rock band from forming friendships,making music, love, life and all the hype that surrounds it.On The Run is extremely well written, character development is spot on and I can't wait to read the next installment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMRR5I4ZCHKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014Q2VXWQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CMRR5I4ZCHKF","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How is it even possible to fall in love with the ultimate sinner that is Malcolm Saint any more than I already have? Well I can categorically tell you it is possible.This Novella could have been filled with Malcolm and Rachel doing the most mundane things and I still wouldn't have wanted to put it down. What draws me to this couple is how incredibly romantic, without being vomit inducing and how passionate and electric they both are, when together.I really was genuinely gutted when the book ended, but such a perfect ending it was.I really really hope Gina and Tahoe find each other in a future book and especially if we get more glimpses of my ultimate book boyfriend that is, Mr Malcolm Kyle Preston Logan Saint.Simply Perfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBSOJQC0OPES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4113H6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBSOJQC0OPES","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book #1 in the Choices Trilogy from new author Dee Palmer....it's not perfect but it's certainly gripping with lots of drama.For me, although said to be a BDSM/D/s book, it was less about that and more about the story.There is so much that happens in this first book that it's kind of hard to review without giving too much away.†Bethany is on her own, with no family to speak of really, except the family that have taken her in. She's hard working and struggling to juggle her education with her need to make enough money to cover her bills.She has an encounter with Daniel Stone that leaves her experiencing feelings she's never had before. Although I liked Daniel's character, he wasn't as much of a Dom as I'd expected and I guess this is my biggest issue with this book.¬†I've never known a Dom to ask so many questions. Doms IMO demand...they don't ask and for me there were too many question marks when he's demanding things. I think some must be in error as some of the sentences just don't work as a questions.That being said, it's definitely a page turner and I was compelled to keep reading. Once I got over my issues with how dominant or forceful Daniel was or wasn't, I really got into the story.There's laughter and tears, drama in abundance and a nemesis too. There's plenty to sink your teeth into.¬†For a first book, with only a few minor editing issues, I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to book two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUM3PCI8P2AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2YDT5W#wasThisHelpful","R1GUM3PCI8P2AR","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 3 in the series but can be read as a stand alone.I've never read any of the books in the series previously to this, or for that fact from this author. But I'm so glad I did!!Let me just say, this is not a typical book that I would pick up on my own. When I skimmed the blurb, I volunteered to give this a go.In this book we have Noah, he's an adrenaline junkie.If it's jumping out of a plane, sky diving, skiing down a mountain slope he's there. Until one of those super stunts changed his whole life in every way possible.Then we have Charlotte, she's on her way to her dream after graduating in music from Julliard. She plays her violin straight from her heart  with feelings that pump through her soul.That is until one earth shattering event in her life changed all that.I don't want to give anything away about this book. So my review will be vague. This is like no Coming of Age book I've read before. These characters didn't make me cringe or roll my eyes (I know shocking). They had this amazing story of trying to rebuild your life when you think you honestly just want to crawl away and think you have nothing else to hold you together....However it wasn't a pity party, it was so realistic the way things just happened and came together. I could actually see myself feeling the way these characters did, with the same realistic reactions.We didn't need the normal love triangles, added friends drama or any of the normal stuff that's in these type of books.Even the side characters, you can't help but love most of them too. They all just fit. This story just worked all the way around.It was just real!!These characters and writing stand out on their own. If there is any Coming of Age book you're going to read this year, make it with Noah and Charlotte.I will for sure read this author again and so should you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNYQCZ5QQOJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQI3STE#wasThisHelpful","R3DNYQCZ5QQOJT","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since the death of her brother, Ellie doesn't have a family that she can depend on, apart from her adorable daughter Hope. When Jax rescues Ellie, he not only falls in love with her but Hope too, who has Jax and the rest of his family wrapped round her finger in no time.Until Jax is such a lovely read which in true Until Series style will have you laughing and crying. I can't wait to get my hands on more of the series.Although it's a different series to the Until Series and can be read on it's own, I would recommend that you read the Until Series first as there are a lot of characters from that series and it might get a little confusing trying to work out who everyone is.I love the writing style and the story flows brilliantly.

"In this book we have Ava, she's a nurse who never got to finish school to become a physician after her sister's death. She's raising her nephew in her sister's place.Next we have Dyson, he's a race car driver for Formula One.I felt like this book was just kind of put together as I had no real connection to the characters. I almost felt like it's been done before. Nothing that really stood out to make it unique.There will be some spoilers to back up My OpinionIt was constantly Dyson this, and Dyson that to where it was like a stiff conversation. He and Him, also work.Simon ( the nephew) is to be a main plot point in this book, most things revolve around him. Ava loves him more than life but he's always put on the back burner.For some one who's a main concern he's always put in the second best category..He's mentioned over and over, but has no real story line.Then we have the Russian ""grid girls""They are Dyson's play toys. One minute they are there, the next they aren't. This goes on, here and there with no explanation.Then here's where the creative writing into fiction became off the wall. I understand it's fiction but I mean really??Things that happen are just so far fetched. There is believed fiction of; you can see this happening in real life.¬†Also the blurb goes into Dyson's past. There was nothing at all to say now I understand this is why he's this way. It actually made me wonder more, how he could feel okay being the way he is??All in all this story flowed well, was an okay read.

"Fire of Fryslan is the conclusion to the Tales of Skylge series and it really wrapped things up nicely and also added an interesting character POV (Melinda) and her trials, both with the existing story arc of the series and also coming to grips with her sexual orientation. I would like to state that the author has handled this particularly tricky topic with realism and tact. You only got a glimpse of Melinda‚Äôs character in the previous books but in this installation you definitely come to sympathize with her. She‚Äôs a girl stuck between two worlds, the one she was born into and the one that she wants to make for herself. She really is a very courageous and admirable character. Like the other books in the series this one was extremely well written and the author‚Äôs attention to detail and extraordinary world building capabilities make this a very enjoyable read. The only critique I would offer is that the constantly changing POVs can make comprehending this complex plot structure a little difficult. But the changing POV is necessary since there are a number of story lines that need to be wrapped up. The ending of the book felt a little rushed and I would have liked to see it fleshed out a little bit more. I really enjoyed this series and it‚Äôs one of the more original series that I have read in a long time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36I5B6EK4O5MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPJLBQY#wasThisHelpful","R36I5B6EK4O5MB","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book from Kylie Hillman and she has done really good with it. The story is centred around Laine, the daughter of the president of Black Shamrocks MC. The first few chapters of this book had me a little confused as it starts off four years after an incident that turned Lanie's life upside down and also the people around her. She now has to deal with her ex and all the trouble he has caused and will cause again but to also try and stay strong for herself and her family. The writing of this book is past and present but on each chapter it tells you where you are and which character the part is about, most of it is Lanie's POV but there's  also some from Mad Dog (Mik).Mik is the VP of the MC and long time friend and Laniey's fianc√©e, he's a hard man but loyal to both the club and to Lanie, however a few things happen that really make you think!Then you have Brendon who is the ex and let me tell you he really is a piece of work that you go though the whole book wanting to beat the hell out of for what he does.You meet the other main people in the family and MC in this books such as Beast (prez and dad to Lanie), Benji is her brother by blood and Timber (A MC brother). These are the other characters that stood out throughout the book. There's also Lanie's other blood brother but I won't be saying who that is as it can ruin part of the story for readers.¬†I feel the story line was good however everything did seem to happen within the last 30% of the book. There are twists within the book that make you think that there will be others to follow. Also it's not a typical HEA but also not a cliffhanger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BS73AAN4P34K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R2HSQU#wasThisHelpful","R2BS73AAN4P34K","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay before reading this review please not I have never read para and this was my first go at trying to read it so please go easy on me.This is the story of Willa and Rax 2 people who are from different realms but 2 people who should not be hungry for each other either! Willa is a Seraph which is an Empyrean Angel and she starts off pretty weak but soon learns that her inner/outer angel/demon along with her past can make her stronger and more powerful. Rax is a Gehenna Demon so you know what they say opposites attract but can both of them together unite their realms as one and find the secrets they need to know to keep both their realm worlds safe?I went into this book with an open mind. I'm going to be honest and say I really struggled the first half of the book, mostly due to my lack of knowledge in the paranormal world. The glossary was a godsend to say the least and I'm glad the author included it. In my own honest opinion I have to be honest and say I'm not a converted para reader yet, however the story itself drew me in especially when I got used to the different worlds and meanings. The writing as per usual from this author is flawless and flows well with the right amount of angst and plot twists in the right places. There was a couple of parts where I thought the humerous banter was a bit out of place for a para book but then that may just be me as I have no idea how humour in para books goes. I gave this 4 stars just because for my first para book I think it was just to many things for me to take in at once so my lack of knowledge hindered the enjoyment slightly for the first half of the book. I encourage all you para readers to grab this and Enjoy! Xxx PS I will be reading the next book in the series because I need to know how the overall story pans out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZD7KL59QK2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OVNV8C#wasThisHelpful","R3UZD7KL59QK2X","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don't like a love triangle, this book may not be for you. But for all that's holy†‚Ä™#‚Äépleaseread‚Ä¨!!This book is a stand-alone, but I so hope we hear more from these couples or Mrs. Masen does a series with any of the side couples.We have Presley, she's been dreaming of her perfect life, her perfect man, and the perfect according to her OCD plan of life. If there's a way to make a check list and live strictly to it...Presley found it. She's also strong, smart, and independent.I'm not a huge fan of female leads, but by God, I love her.Then we have Hayden, he's the¬†‚Ä™#‚ÄéJerk‚Ä¨. Can I just say in my defense, when you come back and say, ""how could you?"" I'm sure enough going to say, ""I loved him!!""He's sarcastic, arrogant, and a little easy. Okay a lot easy.These two meet through work and it just goes from there.I loved the back and forth banter. I loved the sparks that grew. I'm so glad this wasn't an insta-love book, that would never have worked with these stubborn, bull-headed, and I love to one up the other characters.One thing I usually HATE is the gay guy pal in all the romantic comedy books. Can I just say, it worked in here!! I couldn't wait to hear what came out of Clive's mouth next. See, she was also so funny, she has some of the best one liners, EVER!!There's only two things I can say even remotely negative about this book:1. I would have loved more smexy time between these two. The thing is though this story is so solid, I didn't notice that I needed more (between the sheets) til I read Epilogue. I was yelling, NOOO!! Hold the press.Which brings me to number...2. I need more!! I loved these characters. I even loved the side characters and their stories. So Mrs. Masen, you HAVE to make this a series.If you are looking for a Rom-Com with strong characters, side characters, and a twisty-thorny plot....This is a MUST read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCK7SH9N8N1QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WV8VMA#wasThisHelpful","RCK7SH9N8N1QL","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the last 10 years, Victoria has and closed herself off from everyone, she has very little contact with her family, she has no friends and no life really outside work. That's her life and she doesn't care about anything else. After struggling for years she finally cracks and her boss forces her to attend group therapy for grief counselling. Reliving her past the last is the absolute last thing she wants to do but it's either that or lose her job, so she reluctantly attends and that's where she meets the gorgeous Chase who is determined to make her live and love again.Both Chase and Victoria are such brilliant characters, the chemistry between them was undeniable and I just got lost in their story.I was broken before I even got to chapter one. The prologue to this book is absolutely heart wrenching. If you are looking for an ""ugly cry"" book then this is definitely for you.

"In this book we have a tale of older man and younger woman. When I say younger woman, I mean much younger. 22 years to be exact. This book isn't all flowers, puppies, and rainbows where everything is wrapped up in a pretty bow. If you find that type of subject matter hard to deal with this book probably isn't for you. This is a standalone.In this book we have Chloe, she's hard to explain in a unique way. She's literally her own person. She has a good heart for what her home life is made of. A neglectful mother, and a father who's a workaholic, trying to provide every last whim for his family. Then we have Isabelle at 12 years old, her and her family move in across the street from Chloe. They become the bestest of friends over the years. All the while growing closer with the whole family. That includes one hot father figure, Mr. Theodore Black.After an accident leaves Mr. Black in one of his lowest points in his life, there is only one person around to keep an eye on him to keep him from self destruction.Let me just say, this book steamed up my kindle. The intimate times, sheesh this author can write!! I was hooked from page one. The writing just flowed throughout this whole book. With the alternate POV we're never left wondering for long about what's going on in Mr. Black's head.This book has so many twists and turns that you don't even see coming while wrapped up in Theo and Chloe's story.I would highly recommend this book for a hot, steamy, taboo read.

"Wow. This book just took the spot of my favourite book EVER!!!Knowing that it's a forbidden romance, I went in thinking that I could predict how the story would go, but I couldn't have been more wrong! I felt a whole range of emotions while reading this book and I pretty much sobbed through the ending.Sevin had agreed to a courtship with Elle and went to live in her parents guest house. They would move into a house of their own once they were married and would be allowed time together unsupervised. That was the plan anyway.Evangeline was on her way to her friends house she met Sevin. There was instant chemistry between them. They chatted for a while and shared secrets, but when Evangeline learned Sevin's name, she ran.Although the story is a stand alone, I'm gutted that it's over.

"OMG this has to be one of the hottest m√©nage books I've ever read!Please note this book is M/F, M/M, M/F/M and M/M/F so if your not into bi sexual m√©nage then don't read ahead.This is the story of Ashlynn Adorite, sister of Mafia boss Max Adorite. Ashlynn uses sex as a coping mechanism to drown out events from her past. She was born in to the Mafia lifestyle and can cope with anything thrown her way, well anything except love. Love is the one thing Ash doesn't understand or know how to feel. That is until 2 men start breaking down her barriers, but can they be successful?¬†Jase is Ash's bodyguard and sex toy but what Ash doesn't realise is what Jase feels deep down not just for her but for the other man that both Ash and Jase like to tease. This is where we get complicated. Leyton is Max Adorites right hand man, he has always been sworn off Ash by his loyalties to Max. Max saved his life and Leyton doesn't want to jeopardise the brotherhood he feels with Max. So the big question is will the temptation prove too much ?Nicole Edwards has got to be my go to author for M/M or m√©nage. The books are so well written and the sex factor is off the charts hot without drowning out the actual storyline. Beautifully Loyal has got to be my favourite one yet between the 2 intertwining series of Sniper One Security and Southern Boy Mafia. I was drawn into the story and connected well with the characters. I can't wait to see the development of the rest of the series as we get to know more of the characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IVL0BUNT02XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CS7UUY#wasThisHelpful","R3IVL0BUNT02XR","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I loved the camaraderie between them all and it was clear to me they were a very close knit group.One night May receives a text message and believing it to be her sister she responds and agrees to go to a dingy biker bar, downtown to try and help her out. And here is where she meets Ozzie, who at first glance is not appealing to May in the slightest.What struck me most about this book was how funny it was. I mean here we have a ditzy girl who carries round her beloved chihuahua in her bag and uses words like 'Toot' and 'Poop', which under normal circmstances wouldn't work for me, but I really did think it worked in this book and then we have Ozzie who is as rugged and mean and moody as they come. How these two could possibly work together was hard to imagine, but the humour in this book makes it totally plausible.I was almost tempted to rate this book higher, but I really do feel there is so much more to come, but what a great start to a series. This is the first book I've read by this author and I can only describe it as a real hidden gem and definitely one for those who love the more humorous side to romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53YQ3NTBOOFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ4IDVY#wasThisHelpful","R53YQ3NTBOOFB","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this series and Crash though it is different characters from the first two books does not disappoint. I was a little in awe of the authors compassion in writing this story that has such a difficult subject matter and honestly a few times I just stopped to absorb the message in her words.We met Violet in Pulse and learned of the trauma she had been through and the lasting effects that the assault had on her and Ash's life, and as her brother starts to make a new life for himself Violet realises that she has to too. As she visits with her therapist we learn of the fears that still hold her prisoner and it is these visits through the book that make for some inspirational writing from the author. With encouragement from her therapist and Ash, Violet prepares to re-enter society and see if she can learn to regain her life and so she agrees to take a position at Pulse, Ash's new gym.Lincoln is another familiar character that I really liked from the previous books and was so happy to learn that this was to be his story. Lincoln is carrying an injury that has forced him to return home from competitive training in Sydney and finding himself at a loose end he agrees to help out as a trainer at the gym for Ash. He is surprised to find Violet working at the gym after learning of her story previously from Ash and he is considerate in his approach to Violet even if he messes it up a few times initially. Lincoln is a great character, he is perfect for Violet and I honestly fell for him more and more as the story unfolded.We learn that Lincoln and Violet both had a thing for each other as teens that they never acted on before Violet was assaulted. That attraction is quickly reignited when they encounter each other at the gym but Violet is quick to dismiss any hope of being able to make the even bigger step of a relationship as she struggles to cope with daily interaction alone. Soon though they become friends and Lincoln is just lovely in helping Violet build confidence and strength and is just what she needs but will she be able to take the bigger step into a relationship? Just as things seem to be working out, Lincoln has to return to Sydney and Violet is left to face up to her fears once again, can she take the bigger step to show Lincoln he is what she needs? Things don't go to plan and Violet and Lincoln are left reeling from a misunderstanding and Lincoln is left to fight for Violet and I was right there with him.I am so looking forward to the next book in this series already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8HDNMMZYVC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CA6K9C#wasThisHelpful","RZ8HDNMMZYVC5","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by the blurb of More Than Water and I wasn't disappointed.The female lead is EJ she is straight talking with no filter, honest and a good friend, I loved her immediately, she is an art history major and very passionate about art, unfortunately her parents dont share that same enthusiasm, pleasing her wealthy parents starts to become a burden as she wants to do her own thing and stretch her artistic wings.EJ starts to work at the library a few nights a week and this is where she meets Foster Blake he is her complete opposite, Foster is a geeky but hot science nerd studying chemical engineering, over the course of working together they form a friendship, but will the friendship be threatened after they share a night of drunken passion? Not at all they become friends with benefits, so opposites do attract!!!More Than Water blends good likeable characters and not just the two leads but secondary characters, plot and writing style all together into this awesome book.Renee Ericson is a new author that I have now discovered and I'm so glad I took the chance and now I can't wait to read more from her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PB6IE7LL16SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYDGW6A#wasThisHelpful","R2PB6IE7LL16SC","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lets¬†get a few things out of the way first before I deliver the good part.1. This CAN be read as a stand alone.2. This is a fetish type book. It's a¬†good way for sure to push a readers limits.3. The words AREN'T spelled wrong. These characters are from London. So of course they would speak and spell the same way.4. Football, this is UK football (American soccer) so the game isn't played wrong.Okay, now the good stuff.If you have read Wrong and Savage, you know Ms. West is one to write things to push the readers boundaries in fetish/BDSM. This book is no different.What is the fetish this time?? You'll have to read and find out.I loved Gemma/Lucy in this book. She's our main character, she's a sex phone operator. She wasn't the ""perfect"" girl we read in most books. She was real. She has the meaty bones and a beautiful personality to complete her. She has a kind heart, she's spunky, and you guessed it, DIRTY!!Next we have Jason. He's the professional baller. Perfect everything on the outside. Life has been a whirlwind for him over the years. Until he makes that phone call and for once he starts to think there is hope that he will be able to finally be happy. But Jason also comes with some baggage. The moody, I-want-to-throat-punch-you wife.Don't say I can't read this if it's cheating and a love-triangle. Just please give it a chance.The story starts off strong from first page up until the last page.These characters and even the side ones (Masque, anyone??) had me smiling, yelling, and swearing. May have even blushed at some of¬†these steamy parts.I'm also excited for Ms. West, it's like watching your child grow. Her writing just grows stronger with each book. She's definitely one to keep an eye on in the world of 'Taboo' writing. I can't wait to see what she tackles next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWTVWNFBBO0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HN8TSY#wasThisHelpful","R2QWTVWNFBBO0R","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 Stars overallHero 4.5 starsHeroine 4 stars†Plot 3 stars¬†Romance 4 stars¬†Sex Factor 5 starsWhat attracted me to this book the most was the idea that this could possibly be so much more than all the other Step-Brother romances that are out there right now.With this book, there was a history with Ayden's step-father and that for me is what could set it apart from everything else. Unfortunately, the uniqueness of a possible step father/step brother love triangle just didn't really come into play for me and I do feel that more emphasis on a love triangle could have turned it from a good book into a great book.Having said that, Jaimie did not dissappoint on how insanely hot this book was. There were definitely a few hot (and i mean HOT with a capital HOT) under the collar moments with the explosive chemistry between Hunter and Ayden.I absolutely loved Hunter's character. He was your typical hot and sexy bad boy with a filthy, dirty mouth and an equally hot father who was about to marry the most evil vile mother I've come across in a book. She almost seemed unbelievable at times.As for Ayden, I really liked her as a character, but the fact that she seemed to attract every male within a square mile radius and turn them into sex crazed monsters was almost too much at times.If I'm perfectly truthful, I did find the ending to be a little rushed, but despite this book's negatives, there were, for me, many more positives and it was quite frankly a book I couldn't put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NMTVPQAWW0RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BHRQXK#wasThisHelpful","R3NMTVPQAWW0RW","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying that I'm sorry but this book just wasn't for me.¬†It's not badly written and it's well edited with only a few easily made mistakes but it wasn't at all what I was expecting when I read the synopsis.Pierre has a reputation as an intolerable, insufferable chef with a fiery temper and no patience at all. This persona lasts all of two seconds when he meets Holly and she wins him over almost immediately. I was expecting more of a build up and as a result, I couldn't buy into his tough persona. He supposed to be an alpha but he's soppier than a wet tissue.I understand that Pierre lost his wife and is still pining for her but he spends a good portion of the book (during the first half at least) talking to her and he can smell her scent on the breeze and believes the breeze is her caress. This was just too much for me.¬†His first kiss with Holly is all wrapped up in his feelings for his dead wife and it was all a bit odd.Holly is a more realistic character and of course she has her daughter but her daughter plays a massive part of the story, where I was expecting it to be more about Pierre and their tumultuous relationship.Things go from zero to sixty in no time at all and it all feels so rushed. There's no tension or build up and as I said before, I couldn't get into Pierre's character, which could have been amazing.So this book wasn't for me I'm afraid and I just felt it was anticlimactic but I wish the author all the best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECQJ26D6NFLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO3R09E#wasThisHelpful","R1ECQJ26D6NFLE","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a college sports romance like no other. The End Game definitely made me feel more emotions than any other sports romance has in the past. It goes way past your typical college romance dramas and deals with the real life struggles and pressures of college students trying to keep up their grades while also trying to be their best out on the sports fields. That ominous prologue will keep you reading and trying to figure out what will happen to the very end. It's raw and heart wrenching, but at the same time, sweet and funny. It definitely leaves you with a rollercoaster of emotions and one hell of a book hangover once you are finished. This was definitely, hands down, the best sports romance I have ever read!!Kate McCarthy writes in dual POV, but we start with Jordan Elliot, who makes her journey from Australia to Texas, to take on a soccer scholarship in her senior year of college. All she has ever hoped for was to play professional soccer and be the best that she can be, and she almost has it within her grasp. All she has to do is work and train hard in her schooling and soccer and she shall be selected for the upcoming Australian World Cup Championship. As if the pressures aren't already enough, one of her professors asked her to tutor a student in the little free time she has left for herself.Brody Madden is one of Texas's rising football stars, and thought to be a 'God' on the football field. But Brody is battling the pressures of less than stellar grades, his overbearing and loveless father who needs to keep his perfect image in the world of politics, and all of Texas expecting him to always be the best he can be. What lengths will he go to keep up being his best? Will Jordan be the best thing that ever walked into his life or the reason he loses it all?I have read Kate McCarthy's Give Me series, and while the two are so very differently written, I love her new book all the same! It was beautifully written and I cannot wait to read more from her, especially if it anything like how she wrote this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Z6Z3T5V05LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","R18Z6Z3T5V05LY","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am the biggest fan of the whole stepbrother/taboo book genre so when I read the blurb and title for this book I just had to read this!Jackson Worthington is the black sheep of his family. He feels like he doesn't belong and having a mother who doesn't hesitate in letting him know she never wanted him and a step father who tries to control his life and career and mold him into his little mini-me, leads to a less than ideal home life. The only person who actually cares for him and makes him feel like he belongs in this family is his fifteen year old stepsister Lily, who he happens to have feelings for.Deciding that he has had enough, he decides to enlist in the Army once he graduates high school. On his last night at home and feeling like he has nothing to lose, him and Lily share a passionate kiss, but end up getting caught by her step father who then kicks him out of the house. He stays gone for seven years, but has thought about Lily and that one encounter every day. When an Army injury ends his military career, he is forced to return home.I have read a whole lot of books from this genre, some good and some not so good, and I feel like this wasn't one of the better ones. I felt like the heroine in the story was very weak, considering her situation and choices she was forced to make. She let her father control every aspect of her life, including a marriage to a man she didn't even like. She was willing to lose her chance at love in order to please her father. This book was a good quick read, but didn't hold my attention as raptly as it could have. Overall, this book was still quite enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SNM759E85D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012089OY2#wasThisHelpful","R27SNM759E85D4","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book, I found it to be refreshingly real. I connected really well with the characters, especially Dana's relationship with her sisters, growing up in a big family I'm very familiar with the fighting like cats and dogs thing. Being British myself I loved the typically British sense of humour that is shown, some of the things the characters say to each other had me laughing my head off and thinking, ""that is so what my friends and I are like"".I thought the way it was written was very clever, with the flashbacks to previous difficult occasions in Dana's life, it gives you a good insight into how much she has overcome, with in being alongside the present you can compare where her life was then and where it is now and it gives you tremendous respect for the girl.The story is engaging, I thought the plot line of Dana's past was very well written. Without giving anything away, I find this subject matter is very hit and miss in books, sometimes it feels rushed and you know in reality it never goes down that way, there is a slow progression, hence why women find themselves a few years down the line and stuck in a situation like this.¬†I loved Deacon, he's a bit cheeky and quite alpha, traits that I think Dana needed in a man to showcase her new strength. There's quite a bit of angst in this story, I may have got a little too sucked into it since there were times I wanted to bang Dana and Deacon's heads together and tell them to pack it in. Especially Dana, she has a hard time letting go of the past and just taking a chance.¬†There is an editing issue, it does need a going over but I just didn't care that much, the story was good enough that for me it didn't really take away from it.¬†I thoroughly enjoyed this debut book and I'll definitely be reading the next instalment to see what other mischief the Daniels sisters have been getting up to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKX9OFWLSC9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCD64UM#wasThisHelpful","R1KKX9OFWLSC9W","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a massive Bella Jewel fan, I've read almost all of her books and I've never been disappointed by her yet. I started off reading her MC Sinners series, which is brilliant and I never thought she'd be able to top herself in the MC genre, but I think she did with the Jokers' Wrath MC! I absolutely adored these books and the characters in them.In book one, Precarious, we are introduced to the Jokers' Wrath MC. The book revolves around Ash and Krypt, I remember reading the blurb for this book when it was freshly released and thinking, what a fresh spin on an MC story. Ash is a prison guard and meets Krypt whilst he's incarcerated, that right there had me hooked.¬†Book two, Melancholy, is Maddox and Santana's story. Now Maddox I have to say caught my unwavering attention is the first book and after finishing the series he's probably my favourite of the Jokers' Wrath boys, although the others do make some stiff competition! This book was even better than the first, I was totally hooked into their story and I couldn't put it down. Maddox is still one of my most favourite book boyfriends ever.In book three, Anguish, we get Mack and Jaylah's story. Mack is Maddox's step-brother and Native American, he's the strong silent type and a bit mysterious. Mack get the shock of his life when an ex-girlfriend dies and he finds out she had a child from him. His world had been turned upside down and he struggles to cope with the changes. To help him deal he hires a nanny, enter Jaylah. Jaylah is just awesome, she's sassy, a little gobby and a lot feisty.¬†In the fourth and final book of the series, Desolation, we get to read Pippa and Tyke's story. Now this one may break your heart. We know from the previous books just what Pippa has gone through, and it is just horrendous, I really felt for her. And she's just so meek and quiet, it's impossible not to love her. I loved Tyke, he's perfect imperfection I think. This story is more angsty than the others so strap yourselves in and enjoy the ride!All in all, this is one hell of a series, one I wish I could experience for the first time over and over again. Bella Jewel certainly knocked it out of the park with this one, and I sincerely hope she's not done with the MC genre yet, I can't get enough of hers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z25CAXNUV6IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ABIIRA#wasThisHelpful","R1Z25CAXNUV6IM","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a standalone.This book is a love triangle. Also there are very few graphic flashbacks, in italics that can be skipped over.Chloe has just turned 18 and is moving off to college for the steps in her life.There is Drew who is 20, he's in a the local band, and also attends the same college as Chloe. It also happens his cousin Alexis is roommates with you guessed it, Chloe.Then, last but not least we have Ryder. He's also in the band and Drew's roommate.That's how this small circle starts.To be totally honest, the last 25% is what saved the rating on this book. Just as it started to flow, it was over.It just felt weird. There was no real connection with any of the characters. Drew and Chloe almost felt like a brother sister relationship, trying to push for more.The writing also didn't flow well. Some parts just dragged on, and others had me shaking my head and laughing out of place.It also felt like Chloe kinda used her past as a crutch, an excuse for situations she didn't want to deal with.When the characters would switch the POV, it seemed more on the guys that the contractions were cut out. It made them sound more like robots than humans.With the editing, if you're going to use a very popular band, it would help to use the right title to the song you have mentioned.There was also over use of many of the same words clumped together. Things just didn't flow well.Over all the story was there, just didn't feel any connection to it.I think with some adjustments on the first half, this could definitely be a 5* read.I wish the author the best of luck in her writing journey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVG3WHGS9LJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TW0X5Z6#wasThisHelpful","RXVG3WHGS9LJ6","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so sorry to see this series end as I have really enjoyed each of the stories.I have loved Slade through the other books and couldn't wait for his story and it didn't disappoint. Slade is hot and hilarious, the things he says throughout this book had me laughing out loud. I thought Britton was a great character, she was a little nuts but not a down beaten character that gave Slade a run for his money in the sass department.Slade and Britton meet when he rescues her from a bar brawl and their connection initially seems like a hot one night stand but revenge plays a hand in bringing them back together and plays a part in where their story takes them as Slade agrees to help Britton track down her sisters ex for answers to her death. Along the way things quickly change for the two of them but Slade senses Britton is holding back on him and is left reeling when the truth comes out.A brilliant conclusion to this great series and I loved this book I think the best of the series. Just sad that there isn't a few more Stone brothers out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4CITKCOVM4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131FWFFS#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4CITKCOVM4J","A1HNLK1WBP36F9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HNLK1WBP36F9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a story of what happens after you die--it uses the Christian version which, although I am not of that religion, did not detract from the storyline. Is there really a heaven--or hell--do angels really look after us here on earth without us knowing. Are we manipulated from above by forces beyond our control?

"This book will definitely keep you reading, no doubt about it. There is a lot of violence, some warranted--some not. James Pruitt is the Sheriff in this small Wyoming town and when a murderous Mexican cartel ends up ""picking on and occasionally murdering"" several town residents--all because LOTS of money was lost in a plane crash--James has to revert to his Vietnam Days mind set to save the town and to prove that the people of Wyoming can not be terrorized!! Then it becomes personal---I didn't really expect the ending, but then in a way I did. This is the second book in this series.

"This novella took me approximately one hour to read--I read it straight through immediately drawn into the drama that was Rex and Jade's (from Destined for Love) impending nuptials. I mean really, these were the two who loved each other forever but because of a feud between their fathers--well--until they finally stood up and fought those stubborn old men! It is now 4 years later and they have decided it is time to start a family--but the Braden men believe in ""first comes love, then comes marriage-THEN comes those baby carriages""! So the wedding is being planned and as in life-anything and everything that could go wrong did including Jade misplacing the necklace that brought them together in the first place!

Each one can definitely be read as a stand alone-the thread that holds them together is the beautiful country of Greece and it's many islands which the author describes in breathtaking detail!

"This book is definitively for young adults and even I enjoyed reading it. My only problem was I just could not pronounce the names of some of the characters in the book--but you can't go by me--some of the names in Harry Potter got me too. I think only kids can get these names! As in any good book the characters are well defined--both the good ones and the bad. Although you might think by the title of this book that there is a lot of time travel--not so much. It is more about Time Travelers themselves.There are really nice illustrations throughout the book which give you an idea of what each Time Traveler looks like--The only reason I am going to tell parents to read this before handing it over is there are a couple of pages that describe in detail the methods used in olden times to interrogate people and they are not pretty!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKX106R0SCNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0994089708#wasThisHelpful","R1QKX106R0SCNQ","A1IUZA9PE3U1MA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IUZA9PE3U1MA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heart rending story of a family torn apart by forces beyond their control. Written in a way that will grip you and not let you go.And the saga continues...In Book 2 we learn about what the lives of Katherine and Tommy were like after they were set from their Mother's home to board. Katherine had it the worst and has a very hard time forgiving her Mother until her Mom is dying and she is asked to care for her youngest sister who will probably never be able to care for herself. Katherine finally does make peace with her Mom but not totally until she hears how many people her Mother has helped and who all show up at the funeral. Tommy is still angry and is still harboring some ill will--plus he is still hoping to get his father back into the fold.

Hoping the two cases are not related Booker is bound and determined to find the perpetrators.

"HARD TO COME BY(Hard Ink #3)by Laura KayeARC ReviewRelease: November 25, 2014My rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****I love this series. Love that each book has an individual story that is wrapped in the red thread that runs through the entire series. I can only imagine what Laura Kaye's story board looks like, in her attempts to keep the series' plot and its characters straight!!Derek, or known to the Hard Ink fans as Marz, is still adjusting to the loss of a limb in an operation gone horribly wrong only two years ago. Around him, his compatriots are finding lasting connections, when he is still dealing with all he has lost. Not that it is easily visible to the outside world, after all, Derek is the one who tends to lighten  the tension in the room. The one person he see revealing all of himself to, is one whom he has plenty of reason not to trust.Emilie is an intuitive character, whose trust has been damaged. Not only by her ex, but also by her brother, whose struggle adjusting to civilian life after his active service, may have drawn him in to some shady circles. With a strong loyalty to her loved ones, but a growing unease regarding her brother, Emilie slowly starts realizing she needs to take action. The arrival of Derek on the scene has her needing to re-focus her priorities and trust her intuition.The premise of this entire series falls within a limited time frame. As does this particular installment. Not normally a big fan of instant love, the tense circumstances make the quick emotional connections more plausible. Laura Kaye adds some serious heat to HARD TO COME BY, with highly eroticized scenes that have steam coming from the pages! Showing an intirely new and rather edgy side to Derek. One I liked...... A LOT!!‚ú®Love this series more with every book!!‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UG538CM3A11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRCO4G4#wasThisHelpful","R30UG538CM3A11","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Kyasi bluetooth keyboard and was excited to give it a try. I work on my iPad all day, every day and am a fast 10-finger typist. My old keyboard was hopping on its last legs and I was glad to find a new one. However, this cover & Keyboard combo, although extremely pleasing to the eye and well made, is not doing the trick for my purposes. I either work with photoshop, or am writing on my iPad and both those things were difficult to do. Working with designs on photoshop, I need complete access to all parts of the screen,  and this cover was too loose fitting and difficult to circumvent with my stylus. The keyboard was hopeless for my 10-finger typing. I'm an author as well and need my fingers to be able to keep moving.... that was not possible with this soft-touch keyboard. Too often my touch was not registered and the space bar didn't work under my thumbs. I quickly moved my ipad back in my old, decrepit cover, with the keyboard that listens to my fingers.I do think, though, that for less intensive purposes, this is a great product. People who like to send a message here and there, surf the net, chat on social networks or play a game, will likely find this keyboard and cover more than functional. It simply didn't suit my particular needs and requirements. That's why I stuck to the middle of the road and rated it with 3 stars, still recommending it for leisure use....","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAV71L709OBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FD9DGZE#wasThisHelpful","R1AAV71L709OBU","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/11/forced-disappearance-by-dana-marton.htmlMy rating: 4 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****A big fan and follower of the Broslin Creek Series, I was excited with the promise of a slightly grittier, perhaps darker and certainly more 'exotic' version of Dana Marton. Not disappointed!! Not at all.Forced Disappearance is a story that allows for a slightly different perspective on the familiar, damsel-in-distress and knight-in-shining-armor standard. Don't get me wrong, neither protagonist is a wilting flower by any stretch of the imagination, but there is a distinct difference.Glenn, despite his brilliance, gives the impression to be rather naive in certain matters. Sure, his will is strong when faced with adversity and he has no problems identifying the danger he is in. But he seems slow to grasp that sometimes the threat can come from a far more familiar direction than questionable Venezualan law enforcement. He has never had reason to doubt loyalties, however, he is a quick study.Miranda, no longer the nerd she once was, is the opposite. Her outlook on things is much bleaker and with good reason. Her learning curve was much sharper and riddled with pain and trauma. It is what makes her good at what she does. She also has nothing to lose and that detachment is what gives her an edge over her enemies.The connection they had when they were younger, still seems to exist, but much has happened in the past several years. And even if they find their way to safety, it is questionable wether that mutual attraction is enough to give them another chance.A strong plot, with some intriguing twists to keep you focused and an exciting dynamic between Miranda and Glenn. I mean that both intellectually and physically!For lovers of the Romantic Suspense genre, this is certainly a recommended read.‚ú®A fast-paced, compelling and at times steamy novel!‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSK806CNFJH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFQPUEK#wasThisHelpful","RLSK806CNFJH3","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In Slay, we see him revealed; layer by layer. And every new dimension that is added to Blade, makes him even more attractive. Who thought that beneath that dangerous veneer would be a man craving things he felt undeserving of. The only person so far who has been able to put a crack in his hard shell has been his sister Madison. That is until he has a good look at a pretty bartender and finally sees her.Layla has had a rough go of it, but she has been able to pull herself on top every time. She wasn't too sure if she would be able to get out of this one, though. Her business partner gone, leaving her with a massive pile of problems, none of which were of her making. Not accustomed to help, Layla initially sees the big hulking man who has been sitting in the corner of her bar as a threat and an intrusion. But object as she might, Blade seems determined to protect her. And if she is honest, she'll admit it feels good; being looked after.Two people with huge chips on their shoulders, who are able to pick away at the other's resistance slowly.A fantastic emotional roller-coaster ride, with a great deal of raw and gritty action to boot. Nina shows us a bit of the entire Storm MC cast, and allows us to keep track of everyone's comings and goings..... and not all of them are rosy!! Significant events take place that shake the core of the Storm MC and have our heroes scrambling to hold things together!!Kudos to Nina for giving us a book that offers not only struggles and resolutions in the series as a whole, but also a renewed anticipation for what is coming next!‚ú®Great nuanced characters, sizzling chemistry and a story line that just gets better and better!‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376BV2L8RQ1CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PW1FVXI#wasThisHelpful","R376BV2L8RQ1CS","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Father of a teenager, he suddenly is thrown into parenthood full time, something that he has wanted for a long time, but it isn't easy. The only love he is interested in winning is that of his son, but the newest neighbor in the old warehouse next to the marina is Callie, a sight for sore eyes, pyjama bottoms and all!Granddaughter of the omni-present Lucille, Lucky Harbor's town gossip and matchmaker, Callie is in town mainly to make sure her Gran hasn't gone completely off the deep end. Running a wedding planning company online, Callie can work from just about anywhere, and returns to Lucky Harbor to keep an eye on Lucille. But her eye has been wandering.... straight to the delectable abs of her high school crush  Tanner, who shows off his well-toned body outside her window on a regular basis.Lust is an emotion both Callie and Tanner know how to deal with. Love however, is an absolute deal breaker and has them both scurrying for cover! Stubbornness is not a becoming quality, I've decided.....Another fun instalment, this time with the slightly more serious involvement of a teenager in need of some good parenting.

"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/10/freed-by-stacey-kennedy.htmlMy rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****A beautifully mature, erotic love story, masterfully told by Stacey Kenney.For those of us who have read the previous novels in the Club Sin series, have come to know Mary, since she has appeared as an occasional character before. She was married to Charles, her Dom and mentor to Dimitri, the owner of Club Sin and hero of the first book in the series.Stacey outlines the life Mary has settled into since the death of Charles, four years ago. When Mary withdrew from a fairly vibrant social existence as well as an active D/s sexlife. Today she focuses on her career as family physician and stays in contact with her adult children. There is no real outside contact beyond that. The only people she occasionally associates with are Dimitri and Presley, his girlfriend.That is where she meets Elliot, a mature business man who recognizes the submissive nature of Mary and challenges her to let it out and play. Intrigued and eager to explore the unexpected feelings of arousal she experiences in his presence, she concedes to a night of play. However, when the play doesn't only awaken her senses but feelings promised only to her deceased Master, she becomes conflicted and chooses denial.Elliot is a very self-assured Dom, who recognizes in Mary something he has been searching for. Married once before to someone more interested in what he could provide financially rather than emotionally. In Mary he sees someone he can share a lifestyle with and after spending some time with her, he senses he is falling deep fast. When Mary balks at further involvement, he resists pushing her, sensing she has unfished issues to deal with. Accustomed to getting what he wants, his patience doesn't stretch far, and it isn't long before he lays it all out for her.Stacey Kennedy shows a deep empathety in the way she describes the emotional struggle and disentanglement for someone trying to move on after losing the 'love of their life'. The characters are delightfully mature in how they deal with their own issues and each other, most times shooting straight from the hip and without unnecessary game-playing. The D/s play is hot and erotic while at the same time respectful and beautiful. To me, the kink portion of the story was not necessarily a red thread, but rather a catalyst for the transformation.Fabulous read and entirely too short!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29AZKJTIRTCYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCSABSM#wasThisHelpful","R29AZKJTIRTCYK","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/11/cold-light-of-day-by-toni-anderson.htmlMy rating: 5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****Have I told you how much I love Toni Anderson's books? Well, I do and Cold Light Of Day is a perfect example of why that is.....Scarlett grew up with a stigma attached to her name. She has always kept a low profile and prefers to remain in the shadows. She can't pass up though, on an opportunity to try and find evidence that her father, who is in jail for treason, was innocent of spying for the Russians. Her chance fails, but her efforts have not gone unnoticed. Not just by the Russians, but by FBI Special Agent, Matt Lazlo, who is convinced of her father's guilt. The Russians want her gone, the FBI wants her safe..... Or do they?Matt Lazlo was drawn to Scarlett even before he knew her real name. He finds himself the only thing standing between her and a certain death. Although Matt firmly believes in his country and its justice system, it slowly becomes clear to him that Scarlett might be telling the truth about her father. Why else would they now both be running for their lives?A story with an immediate hook to reign the readers in, doesn't let up on pace or tension until the very last page. Toni's writing perfectly balances the two main genres, thrilling suspense and a combustible romance. Her characters are three-dimensional, with disctinct personalities and compelling backgrounds. Her plot is never as obvious as it looks, and requires a level of intelligence and a good dose of patience, to unveil.Another example of the amazing writing talent we have to offer here in Canada! If you have not had an opportunity to read anything by Toni Anderson, I strongly suggest you start..... It can be right here, with Cold Light Of Day, because although it is part of a series, each book can stand easily on its own.‚ú®A story of intrigue, betrayal, desparation and unexpected love.‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVON854CSYCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N340WEE#wasThisHelpful","R1QVON854CSYCU","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****I was smart..... I read both the first and second books immediately following the other. It made for a total immersion into this compelling story.... However, now I have to wait for book #3!It has become clear that Livy and Miller cannot stay away from the other. Livy is well aware how 'unavailable' Miller really is, keeping everything close to his chest, but she is beyond caring. Or maybe I should say she simply can't help herself and is prepared to take what she can get from this complex man.Miller knows he is no good for Livy. He has tried everything to walk away or push her away. But still, there she is. Living a life that has never really been his own, he is unable to give what Livy wants; all of him. There are areas of his life he keeps well contained, for his sake and now the sake of Livy as well.Little by little Livy starts peeling away the layers upon layers of self-protection that hide the real Miller from her. She's seen glimpses of him and wants to know why he hides. But when she is suddenly faced with some of the realities that make up his life, staying is harder than she thought it would be.Once again, JEM has created characters, so in conflict with themselves, they muck up any opportunity for a 'normal' relationship with anyone else.

Giving someone else the power for a little while so they have to take the responsibility, too. But it's not safe with most people""All of Tatiana is in these words. Her guilt, her worries, her sense of responsibility, her fears and her needs.This novella by Kit Rocha is as intelligently written as the rest of this series. The main characters are placed in context with a minimum of narration, but a maximum of exposure. Supportive characters, in particular Dallas and Lex, ensure that there is a continuation from the series into Zan and Tatiana's story.I like my novels long, and I don't know whether that played a role in feeling this novella was a bit mellower. Perhaps even softer, than what we are used to from Kit Rocha.

"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.ca/2014/08/blog-tour-giveaway-worth-forgiving-by.htmlMy rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èThe fog of loss has finally started to lift for Lily St. Clair after losing her father six months ago. She was left with the daily runnings of his gyms along with his business partner Joe and Joe's nephew Caden. A fighter who had taken a personal interest in Lily, but was a bit more persistent than she was comfortable with at this point. With Joe ready to retire, they were looking at bringing in some new investors who might be able to take up some of the slack when the time came. Leading the pack is Jax Knight. A man who may not only be the answer to the future of her business, but appears to hold a slew of other future promises as well.....Jax has tried to distance himself from a sordid family scandal that recently came to light, changing his perception of the world. And one that revealed some unexpected additions to his immediate circles. Eager to focus his attentions elsewhere, he devotes himself to the potential investment in the chain of gyms run by Lily St. Clair. A woman he had only spoken to via email or phone before. The flesh and blood version of her had quite an impact. But in his eagerness to ensure the object of his interest and her business are safe, he may have well disqualified himself in the process......I loved the build up of the relationship between Lily and Jax. The little 'special' quirky things they did, to bring their connection to a slightly different plane. The gentle push and pull dynamic that would  not overwhelm, but keep the tension tight enough without breaking or forcing it. Only to result in a delicious and rather voracious consumation from both sides, once the gloves came off!I have read each of the books in this series and thoroughly enjoy them. Not generally a fan of the fighting sport, I can see and appreciate the dedication, skill and work it takes to be able to reach that level. It is also clear how difficult it would be, given the intense training, the schedule, the travelling and the external attention, to pursue and maintain a meaningful relationship, yet Vi Keeland gives us men who all show they are ready to make the necessary adjustments in their life to make that happen. And she develops women who are strong enough to stand up to them, stand up for them and stand by them, while at the same time allowing their male counterparts to do the same for them.

The brilliant duo that makes up Kit Rocha has done it again. The tale of Trix and Finn as much a part of the Beyond Series as it is a beautiful and unique story all its own.The first time Trix was wrapped up with Finn, neither of them were strong enough - or sober enough to stand up to the vicious and depraved leader of Sector Five. Trix manages to find her way to the O'Kanes, where she gets clean and learns for the first time what it means to be part of a family. Of something positive. Of a community that lives, loves and fights together.Believing Trix gone permanently, Finn gets clean of drugs as well, but his objective is much darker. Continuing to live in the oppression of Sector Five, he slowly works his way around, looking for an opportunity to destroy the nefarious leadership from within its own ranks. He has nothing to lose but his own life, which is worth less than nothing without Trix.When he finds her back in the confines of Sector Five, abducted by an O'Kane reject, he barely has a chance to recover from the shock before he is forced into action. He does now what he should have done four years ago. But the choice could cost them dearly.I loved this book. I think it is likely my favorite thus far. Not necessarily because of the main characters (although I love them both) but because of the type of connection - the honesty in their relationship. The direct way Trix and Finn relate to each other, without game or jealous antics, was refreshing.Of course, it wouldn't be a Beyond novel, if it didn't have at least one good O'Kane party in it. And boy, is this a hot one. Dallas and Lex show Finn and Trix how partying is done - O'Kane style!!

High marks once again to Callie Hart!Even more so than the previous installments, TWISTED almost reads as an individual story. Not so much with respect to the background context, but when it comes to the individual development of the characters, it contains humungous strides!Although Sloane has come into her own throughout the series, she proves in this book how strong and secure she has become. Trusting her own judgement over other's clouded opinions and acting on her gut instincts is serving her well. She isn't only confident with Zeth's place in her heart, but her place in his as well. Even if he can't get his mind wrapped around it yet.Zeth faces a huge transformation. It has been coming, but he is starting to recognize it himself, which has him all manners of confused. Sloane has slowly peeled away layer of protective shielding that have served him well since childhood. And he has let them slip, barely noticing at first. With the realization that Sloane has become more important than he would have liked, the pressure to keep her safe and deal with the threats they are facing becomes high priority. Especially when he discovers that Charlie has found a way to penetrate his inner circle.This is the most moving episode of this series so far, with Zeth's callous and hard exterior finally cracking, allowing Sloane in. But also creating a weak spot for predators - and Zeth has many of those lying in wait.Make sure you have a few hours of uninterrupted time before you open this book - you won't want to put it down once you start!!

Each of these books are standalones, although the cast of characters are becoming familiar and we get to check up on Josh and Cara, who found each other in book one.Lauren is in the process of finalizing her divorce from her sleezeball of a husband who is only interested in her money. Some she has come by through a trust she never knew about. Money that has nothing to do with him, just like he has nothing to do with her new found passion - But she isn't stupid, she realizes he will want a chunk of that too, which is why she keeps that a big secret. Once friend, and now lover Ty is determined to stand by her side and jump in the fray for her. Not something she is familiar with, but something she sure could get used to.Ty has been waiting patiently on the sidelines, watching Lauren wash off that creep of a husband. Not wanting to move in too fast, he has stuck to their friendship. But when he finds out her ex is making her life difficult, there is no reining in his protective instincts. He comes by those from years of experience. He makes it very clear straight off the bat, where he stands with Lauren, and although reluctant at first, Lauren seems to want to take a chance on him. He has a long road to go, however, earning her trust.The story is a familiar friends to lovers trope, but is not approached in the same way. The switch is made fairly early in the story and the bulk of the book really revolves around shaking off the past in order to build a new future on a clear slate. I liked that.The book also had some suspense elements that added to the overall interest level and of course Kristen wouldn't be Kristen if there wasn't a good deal of bedroom heat involved. But it had sweet overtones between these two.... very caring, and any aggression in their sexual interaction was heavily balanced with soft nurturing.A delicious, rather mellow read of a quality you would expect from Kristen Proby.‚ú®A tight, edgy and sensuous story!‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HO4C8O4VX0AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB4Y2#wasThisHelpful","R3HO4C8O4VX0AH","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At first glance they appear to be 'just' another romance novel. Exceptionally well-written, mind you. But then the surface skin of simple small-town life starts peeling back, to reveal the underlying darker individual layers of complex circumstances and histories. All Ms. O'Keefe's characters are rife with rich context, both in behaviour and personality.Shelby's life consists very much of two parts; One is visible to the outside world and has her in the role as art teacher at the local elementary school, as well as the driving force behind the Art Barn, an after school project for local children. Everyone knows her as a kind and outgoing individual. The second part only exists within the confines of her home, and has her in care of an ailing mother who no longer has a grip on the passing of time, and pulls Shelby back into memories of a dark history she'd rather forget. Life inside those walls is anything but controlled; it is unpredictable and utterly exhausting.There is only one reason Ty settled down in Bishop, and that is to provide stability for his son. A son he has barely gotten used to having. Having grown up himself without the benefit of good parenting, he is determined to do better by his own child, but the adjustment is not an easy one. Much has happened in the boy's young life that Ty has not been privy to and when he acts out, Ty has no idea how to deal with it. On top of that, being rooted in one place is not something that feels comfortable for someone who has been skimming through life so far.There are two secondary characters in this novel that deserve attention. Both were written with great understanding despite the gigantic gap in age and issues. Yet despite their differences, they form an unlikely bond of sorts, that is so very moving.In all the books I've read from her so far, Molly O'Keefe has touched on a number of difficult and potentially devastating health and life circumstances that in some way are recognizable to all of us. She does so with tremendous insight, care and respect. Her books leave me moved, every time.‚ú®Yes - exciting and hot, but also very, very moving....‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHXH9DTFOC1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I7660XK#wasThisHelpful","R1QHXH9DTFOC1G","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Having grown up in extremely sheltered circumstances she has found in BDSM a safe structured way to express herself. What she hadn't counted on was to be pulled out of her normal role as  a switch into the more defined zone of submissive at the hands of this formidable Dom. But although the promise of more hangs in the air, as usual Poppy feels dismissed to second rank when he suddenly leaves to attend to work matters.Separating his two lives is something DEA agent and Dominant Damien carefully has to balance. But when a case he has been devoted to heats up just as he is getting to know the delightful Poppy on an intimate level, the call of duty wins. Conflicted he realizes he may have made a grave mistake with Poppy and when he bumps into her again, he works hard to prove to her and himself that he can change his priorities. But when the subject of his years' long investigations finds his nemesis' weak spot, Damien has to focus all his energies to save her from a fate much, much worse than his paddle....*****Oh WOW!! Hot is too mild a word!!This is a fantastic balance between suspense, romance and BDSM erotica! With high scoring marks on all the components!! A solid suspense story, with well worked out plot and characterizations, a full context and satisfactory conclusion. Right along side a romantic story that plays all the right tunes, the hesitance, the insecurities, the reluctant feelings and the inevitebility of emotion. Only to be topped off by a delightfully unique BDSM component that is more lighthearted than most, in that it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and in dealing with a committed Dom and a switch/at times submissive, it makes for a lot of truly playful time in which we get to see what feels like a more realistic reflection of a BDSM relationship. I have to admit I am only guessing at this since I can't speak out of experience, but it 'feels' more true.Sydney Bristol writes with a lot of insight in the human psyche, a tremendous amount of intelligence and a good dose of humor. She has a quirky side to writing that comes out in her character of Poppy, who seems a little 'odd' at times, but wonderfully so. Ms. Bristol also deals in passing, so as not to give it more credence than it's worth, with a mixed race relationship and some minor adversity it generates. But more importantly, she shows the overall matter of fact acceptance as ""nothing special"" by the majority, which is lovely to see.A completely engaging book, that held me from beginning to end and I will keep an eye out for further books in this vein......

Unfortunately an injury during training got him sent home early and he ends up back in the gym in a foul mood. That is until he spots Harper, who seems to be determined to put a smile back on his face.Harper was disappointed when Gage left to go to training camp for his big fight and never bothered to contact her. But seeing him around the gym made her decide she was going to have to be the one to put herself out there and see where it leads. If anything she might get a hot one night stand out of it. And you know what they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained.*****What was a long, slow and simmering warm up behind the scenes, turns into a fast, intense and hot novella at the hands of Lori Foster! What a way to start a new series!!The main characters, Gage and Harper are regulars at the rec centre, which also doubles as the gym, where it seems all the fighter guys hang out. We are introduced to a few interesting and one particularly colourful prospect for future instalments.As a very short introductory novella, HARD KNOCKS does its job. It gives us a couple that already has a connection so it doesn't take much for sparks to start flying in earnest, and both of them are tied to the sport and the people that are going to play leading roles in the books to follow. It allows us to get a feel for the atmosphere, the camaraderie, the dynamics between the different players and the level of intensity we can expect.In a novella of this size, we can't expect a tremendous amount of context or indepth exploration of the individuals, but keep in mind that that is not really the objective. The idea is to get a taste of what Ms. Foster has in store for us before we get our first full sized novel. And this little 'amuse-bouche' had just the right amount of 'flavor' for me!!

Although, like I said - you'll get enough of those to whet your appetite as well, so don't worry!Our heroine who is guilty of limited vision due to a fairly narrow minded attitude, gets an opportunity to have a look behind the scenes into a profession that she scoffed at.

"My rating: 4 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èAfter his brother and father clued in to the depth of his addiction, Taylor Reese was shipped off to his uncle's ranch, away from the temptations of the big city and the draw of his questionable friends. With issues that run deeper than his addiction, anger is the only emotion Taylor knows. But with lines firmly drawn in the sand by his family, he has no choice but to toe the line. Hard farm work helps him let off some necessary steam and he finds himself reassessing his life.When Libby Karlin and her young son found work on the ranch years ago, she had finally found a safe place to call home. And yet, the arrival of the angry and abbrasive Taylor did not make her feel threatened. Both Libby and her son seemed to be able to see more goodness in him than he believed he posessed. Aware of his reasons for being there, Libby starts to fall for the good but vulnerable man who emerges.Taylor realizes there is more to Libby's own history than she has shared, but it isn't until her past catches up with her, that she finally opens up. Compelled to protect the woman who has captured his attention, Taylor has to overcome some of his own barriers to make sure nothing will ever touch her or her son. But where will that leave them?*****Another wonderful novel by M.A. Stacie!! And yet so very different from the first one in this series.We met Taylor in BENEATH THE SURFACE, the story that focused on his older brother, where Taylor was justly portrayed as a flailing, spoiled and self-indulgent rich boy. All very accurate descriptions at the time. But here we get a closer look at some of the events that lead him down that path, and also a more accurate assessment of his character. Not so much self-indulgent as escaping. Rejection, neglect, hurt and lack of coping skills were a potent cocktail. Ultimately it seemed that some tough love, and some unconditional faith in him from his uncle, Libby and her son, was enough to instill some belief in himself. Not only had it been good for him to get out of the city to get away from temptation, but also to get away from low expectations and lack of faith he was instilled with daily there.Libby has already had struggles of her own and made huge leaps of faith by herself, and she is strong enough to trust herself to make the right judgement in Taylor. Both for herself and for her son, of whom she is very protective. Her instincts serve her right, because for all the strength she shows in support of Taylor, when it comes time where she finds herself weak and on the virge of losing her faith - it is Taylor who is able to hold her together.Beautiful emotional journey of a man who had become unrecognizable by his addiction and struggles to find his will, his identity, his strength - himself. Written with a great amount of insight and understanding by M.A. Stacie. The book is very moving, but there are also lighter times, some tense and scary moments and a variety of decidedly hot and explicit encounters.It is possible to read BEHIND THE SCANDAL as a standalone novel, but you would miss out on some of the back story and a lot of the family dynamics. So I would highly recommend reading BENEATH THE SURFACE first.....and you won't regret reading either one!! But I'll say it again, they have a very different feel, each perfect for the brother they describe.‚ú®A sensitive, sobering and sexy tale of pasts catching up.‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WB468TNJGWGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9IS84Q#wasThisHelpful","R2WB468TNJGWGL","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/07/honey-whiskey-by-carina-adams.htmlMy rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****Wow!! I am SO impressed!! This is the second book by Carina Adams and the second in the Bastards' MC series and it shows such incredible improvement and growth.The background story of The Bastards MC series was a very intriguing one right from the beginning, and Matty and Jo's story formed a beautiful introduction to this group of militant misfits with giant soft spots. However, in book one Matty and Jo never got to finish telling their entire tale. A lot happened in that novel and the reader was left feeling a bit confused and perhaps lost with more questions than answers, not realizing that there would be another book to follow that would provide closure on many of the dangling threads.And Honey Whiskey sure brings closure to some issues - at least for Matty and Jo it does. Matty lived in fear of Jo finding out about his double life, the other side of him he had never disclosed to her. He knew she loved the fun and BFF version of him, but would she still feel that way if she knew all of his secrets?Jo has made some major changes in her life, not the least of which is her divorce and the joint parenting agreement she negotiated with her ex. Ready to focus on herself, it is time to make some decisions. One of them is moving to Boston, which happens to be where Matty is based as well. Lucky coincidence or calculated strategy? We'll never know, but facing him again brings home how pathetic her life has been without him in it.A very unique format for an MC story as well as a complex but truly moving love story between Jo and Matty, one that will stay with me for a long time. Very well done, Carina! I hope there will be many more BASTARDs MC novels to come, because of the wonderful group of characters portrayed, many of whom deserve their own happy ending.

"My rating: 3 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****An enjoyable afternoon of reading!Although not my favorite Garwood book, FAST TRACK certainly holds the title for richest in plot. In fact it can almost boast a dual plot. One with Cordelia at the core and the other, minor one, with Aiden at the centre. Unfortunately this is also where I feel the synopsis becomes very misleading, as the secondary plot is promoted as if that is the main red thread and the death threats are suggested to be on Aiden's life, whereas the book does not play out that way at all. I don't mind a taking some creative liberties for the sake of promoting the story, but this is simply not accurate.I enjoyed the concept of Cordelia's character, although I never quite got a firm grip on her. Aiden seemed more clearly defined, but was less likeable until the very end. His turnaround was quite abrupt and a little unexpected. We hoped for the sake of Cordelia, sure, but not because he gave any inclination to want to change.The most enjoyable part for me was actually the description of the precocious but shy 5-year old versus the teenage wise guys, that was an image I carried through the whole book with me. There wasn't anything wrong with the rest of the story, in fact, the premise of the storyline was quite intriguing - but the way it came across was almost hasty. There was a lot of information to be passed on and it felt as if there was depth lost in favor of compressing the story. As a result, I didn't really connect that well - wasn't fully engaged. That is not to say I wasn't entertained, because I was, but it was from a safe and forgettable distance.Although FAST TRACK is part of a larger series, and I am sure it helps with continuity to have read all the previous book, it is for all intents and purposes a true 'standalone' novel.‚ú®A gripping, twisted and charged breakdown of morals.‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFOUAGUHJ4X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L153Q#wasThisHelpful","RHFOUAGUHJ4X8","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****Dark brooding mysteries and delicious thrills in this new Krewe of Hunters novel by Heather Graham!!FBI agent Craig Rockwell, 'Rocky', has been followed by the unsolved murder of a childhood friend. When he is accepted as part of the Krewe to investigate a new murder with the same MO thirteen years after the original one, he feels he finally has the back up he needs to follow his instincts, and his ghostly guidance. Especially needed when he is back where he grew up, looking at old friends and school mates as possible suspects now.Her discovery of the body of a woman near her cabin has put Devin Lyle in the middle of a murder investigation that brings Rocky to her doorstep. She is stunned to find he can see and interact with her dead great-aunt Mina, who is trying to help with the investigation, which seems to point at witchcraft. Something Devin can assist Rocky with. But they find they have more than this investigation in common..Heather Graham's Krewe of Hunters books are the rare exceptions to my 'no paranormal' rule!! Her story lines always stay rooted in the here and now, even though the route to get from question to answer may be under the guidance of a spirit or two! The open minded attitude toward all that is possible yet unseen, appeals to me, especially when it isn't used as an excuse to create a host of unearthly resolutions and outcomes to cover up poorly executed plots. Not at all an issue for this fabulous author. The plots are tight, the twists keep coming and you will keep guessing until the last pages. Add to that a generous helping of scrumptious heat, and you have THE HEXED.‚ú®A splash of spicy romance in an evil twisted tale!‚ú®**A copy provided in return for an honest review.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEHFEV6ZF7ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWU47YK#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEHFEV6ZF7ML","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.ca/2014/07/betting-on-grace-by-nicole-edwards.htmlMy rating: 4 of 5 BLAZING ‚≠êÔ∏è*****Absolutely INCINERATING!!!After the little 'amuse-bouche' I had in BOOTS OPTIONAL of Grace, Grant and Lane, I was eager to dive in to BETTING ON GRACE. Boy.... no disappointment there! Just as deliciously voluptuous as promised, but with a bit more 'bite'.Grace has enjoyed the attentions of Grant and Lane in the past few months, very much so, but sneaking around on everyone is taking its toll. She would love nothing better than to be able to express her feelings for these two men out in the open, but how does one go about opening up when it is something she is not particular good at doing anyway? Besides, theirs is not the most conventional of relationships and how can she explain that?Lane is probably more at ease with where their threesome is and where he would like it to go, than either of the other two. But even he recognizes the potential pitfalls. Although his biggest issue is not so much what the world at large thinks, but rather the level of committment of his lovers. Is he going to have to be content to be the only one of the three of them who puts himself on the line?Even though Grant deeply cares for his lovers, his life is spinning out of control and for someone who at the best of times has difficulty expressing himself, this is cause for him to clam up even more. Confused, frightened and feeling without direction, he needs to balance of Lane and Grace to keep him grounded. But it is time for him to stand up and be counted as well.The context of the story just deep enough to make it compelling, yet not too heavy. I still count this as reasonably light reading from an emotional point of view. A tad predictable, but that doesn't take away from the seduction of the story as a whole. A highly satisfying read on many levels!A touch of angst, some intense family drama and wicked, wild monkey sex!!

"My rating:  4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****It's finally Melanie's turn!Melanie, Brook's best friend, has spent her life dreaming of meeting 'The One', the man who would be her everything. In fact, she had spent the past years trying out every male prospect she came into contact with to see if he could fit the bill, but to no avail. Her true love wasn't among the string of one-night stands she took to her bed. And happy as she was that her friend had found exactly what she craved for herself, she couldn't help but feel a little envious. When she meets Greyson King, she is expecting nothing more than her regular temporary relief, but instead finds herself completely taken with a man who seems to be as elusive as smoke.Greyson didn't think he had any true feelings left in his body. Not after the way his father trained him to step into his footsteps one day with the same ruthless disregard. So the instantaneous feelings of possiveness when he spots Melanie, take him aback. All he knows is that he can't allow another man near her, she needs to be his. Having been lured back into his father's web after years of successfully avoiding him, Greyson tries to balance the two halves of his life for fear of the ramifications if the boundaries should blur. But inevitably they do and he finds himself surprised to be fighting for something he never thought he wanted or could have.A very decent follow up to Brook and Remington's story, with brief appearances and references to the couple.Melanie is a rather conflicted individual who carries some childhood guilt and pain, which was never quite resolved and seems to have had an impact on her emotional development. Her view of the world is at the same time overly romantic and terribly disappointing. But she is looking actively and fights for what she dreams to have.For Greyson who's childhood trauma is of a far different  nature, leaving him desillusioned and cynical. But Melanie loosens something in him that he fights hard to resist. To no avail. Unfortunately he knows any interaction with her could put her in danger, but he can't seem to help himself. She is changing his outlook.I enjoyed the book, read it in one sitting, but I have to admit, it isn't Brook & Remington. Those two spoke to me like nothing else did with a connection so powerful it was an almost visceral sensation - whereas Melanie and Greyson obviously have great chemistry, but not quite as epic as their predecessors.I love Katy Evans' writing style and will never, ever turn down a book with her name on it. She is one of those rare authors who has the ability to make the world disappear around you, regardless of where you are when you open one of her books. She has a fan for life.‚ú®Dangerous, emotional, voluptuous and highly charged!‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6V9NIMBIZ9JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D0MZXDO#wasThisHelpful","R6V9NIMBIZ9JK","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/07/desired-by-stacey-kennedy.htmlMy rating: 4.5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****A beautifully subtle, yet descriptive insight into a budding BDSM relationship, written by the amazing Stacey Kennedy, who has already proven herself a shining star in this genre.Without resorting to high drama, Stacey has the ability to illustrate the delicate emotional balance that is needed to form a successful long term relationship - D/s or otherwise. The irony is that a good Dominant/submissive relationship could serve as an example to any and all relationships, with its emphasis on good and clear communication, the importance of knowing the other's wants and needs, and learning to observe each other's signals and 'tells'. Should all vanilla couples put this much effort into their relationship and each other, we would have many more happy couples.Ella is brand-new to BDSM, but has recently vowed to take on any new challenge and is certainly not adverse to adventurous sex. She is more than open to explore, and most certainly with Kyler. Her problem is not with the physical demands of BDSM, but with understanding and absorbing what it means to completely 'belong' to someone .... just as he 'belongs' to you. No holds barred. None at all.Kyler is very clear on his needs, there is no ambiguity there. And he is also very quick to realize that the 'vanilla' Ella might well be 'the one' for him, but it is highly dependent on whether the lifestyle he chooses suits her. And therein lies the challenge. Not normally a very patient person, Kyler has to tread carefully, and finds himself so focused on what she might be holding back, he forgets to listen to what she needs.The portrayal of a very strong and independent woman, searching of new ways to challenge herself, is very empowering and a great choice in the role as heroine for this story. The hero is a Dominant in heart and soul, yet avoids work promotions, preferring his lesser position directly serving the public. Oh the irony. It's perfect to illustrate the D/s relationship is much more two-sided than us un-initiated often think.No excessive highs or lows in the story, but a good steady flow and entirely compelling. As the other books in this series, DESIRED was an absolute treat to read and even if you are new to BDSM, this might be a story to help you understand the dynamic. Each book  in the Club Sin series serves as a stand alone story, but I've read them in sequence and preferred it that way.‚ú®A deliciously wicked, intuitive and poignant leap into submission.‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M16XCHNRZX3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMEBPS#wasThisHelpful","R3M16XCHNRZX3O","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"http://ripeforreader.blogspot.com/2014/07/all-of-you-by-gina-sorelle.htmlMy rating: 5 of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è*****Absolutely phenomenal!!I had been anticipating this book for a long time, ever since I had finished reading ALL OF ME, the first book in this series, and the amazing Gina Sorelle did not disappoint! Even while reading the first story of Stella and Nathan, the chemistry between Kat and Danny was palpable, and the complexities of a possible relationship were hinted at.Danny is Nathan's best friend and partner on the police force, and from the time he meets Kat, Stella's sister, he feels a strong pull toward her. But he doesn't like entanglements, heck, he doesn't like anything with strings attached. They usually mean pain and heartbreak in his experience. So he does what he does best, he lives up to his well-earned reputation of manwhore and tries hard not to be envious of the safe haven his friend Nathan has found in his marriage with Stella. And he also tries avoiding Kat, whose dislike for him is obvious, which is probably for the best, since he could never be good enough for her anyway. But what he wouldn't give to call that amazing woman his.Kat is over the moon for her sister Stella, who managed to beat a life threatening disease, found herself a good man and now they had a gorgeous little girl. She also realized that those things were not in the cards for her. Her work as a geneticist gave her enough satisfaction. Good at what she did, she hopefully could have a positive impact on some lives through her research. Her diagnosis with MS seven years ago had put a stop to dreams like love and a family of her own. It would be unfair to tie herself to anyone, when her future was so unsure. From day to day her situation changes and it was difficult enough on her, no need to drag someone else into it. The last thing she needed would be to fall for Danny, but it was so hard to stay away when he was so embroiled in her life.Two ""damaged"" people - each not thinking themselves worthy of the other, in some way, yet forcefully drawn together. Two major stumbing blocks, one an indelible imprint from the past, that cannot simply be erased and the other a frightening certainty for the future without a timeline. It is almost too much to contend with, but with the love, support and meddling of the big and boisterous Ciaramitaro family, Danny and Kat take on the challenge.I don't think I've ever cried so much for so many reasons while reading a book..... Not that it was sad - not at all. But I was so engaged in this story, so understanding of Kat's plight in particular, that it was almost cathartic to read. So many inner thoughts, fears and feelings I recognized were right there..... in writing. So yes, I cried, because I was there - am there - along with many others who deal with chronic disabling disease, in this book.I thanked Gina Sorelle after I read ALL OF ME. I have to thank her even harder after ALL OF YOU. Her writing way above par, her insight and understanding gives me goosebumps, her stories are a perfect mix of emotion, humor and yes .... thank God .... hot sweaty sex!Her writings have been a great motivator to me personally to reach for more, to dare to step outside the box to which I thought I was assigned.‚ú®Tore me up and put me back together - better than I was.....‚ú®**Copy provided in return for an honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AKAOC2PVST2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6D9NNY#wasThisHelpful","R1AKAOC2PVST2C","A1O5BMIWBH4OG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O5BMIWBH4OG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a bit hesitant to spend the extra money for the Muck brand when I decided to buy snake boots for turkey hunting, but after a season‚Äôs worth of use I can say that I am glad I did.  Before I get into the review, I should start by saying for those who have not purchased Muck brand before, I highly recommend visiting the Muck website for information on proper sizing (more on this topic at the conclusion).  I needed a boot that was snake proof, had a good climbing pattern for traction, was not too hot, was waterproof, and was comfortable enough to walk several miles in rough terrain.  I also liked the prospect of having a rubber boot for scent control to utilize during bow season.  So far, I believe I have made the right choice.The overview on this boot:Temperature Control ‚Äì One of my initial concerns with this boot was whether it would be too hot for Tennessee turkey season, and one of the biggest complaints I have heard concerning Mucks was that they can sweat you out.  I was pleasantly surprised with my experience, and I think the new ‚Äúcool linings‚Äù may actually work the way Muck claims.  I wear Merino wool hiking socks with these boots, so that probably helps quite a bit, but these do seem to do a great job wicking moisture away from your feet.Terrain Traction ‚Äì One of the main locations I turkey hunt is a rather large timber tract with extremely steep terrain over large portions of the property.  The areas of old growth mature hardwoods are broken up by plantings of loblolly pine, and densely vegetated thickets of volunteer evergreen and deciduous softwoods; making hunting areas accessible only by hiking in distances from a quarter mile to 4 miles.  The area also happens to have a rather high population of Timber Rattlesnakes, along with Copperheads, and even some Cottonmouths near the beaver ponds along the lower property boundary.  Hence, I need a boot that will give me some reasonable snake protection, while also providing enough traction to climb the steep access trails.  These muck boots have performed quite well for the traction side of the task (I can‚Äôt speak to the snake protection, as luckily I have not tested that feature).  On several occasions I found that I fared as well as hunting partners that were wearing actual hiking boots.Durability ‚Äì One season is not really enough to judge a $200 boot, but so far they have held up fantastic.  They are actually more comfortable now than they were at the beginning of turkey season.Waterproof ‚Äì They are Muck Boots.  Enough said.  They are absolutely water proof unless the water is deep enough to run in over the top of them.Overall Comfort ‚Äì These wear quite well for a tall rubber boot.  They have a rubber exterior all the way to the top (to get the snake protection), unlike most Muck boots that have a neoprene only upper.  Although the rubber is necessarily more rigid than a neoprene upper, they are still more comfortable than most snake boots.  The rubber actually flexes in more distributed fashion, which prevents the uncomfortable pinch points present in many snake boots.  Turkey hunting requires less than ideal sitting positions often times, so I worried that these would interfere, but again I have had no issues in that regard.Size ‚Äì Again, I highly recommend visiting Muck‚Äôs website to check proper sizing.  I normally wear a size 11 in both work boots and athletic shoes, but a friend who owns some Mucks advised that I check their website before purchasing to ensure I get the right size.  Mucks only come in whole sizes, and according to their chart I would need a size 10, which seemed a bit unnerving since my feet are uncomfortable in even a 10 1/2 work boot.  Even the salesman at the store where I tried them on was totally unaware of this concept, but I am glad I did listen to my friend.  These boots work much better with a slightly snug fit, and will break in over time.  If your heel slips while walking on a flat surface, you need a size smaller in this boot.  I even wore fairly thick Merino socks (Smart Wool Hunt Medium) in the early part of the season, and the fit was still comfortable.Trademark Smell ‚Äì The only slight downside I have found to these boots is that they do have a unique odor associated with them.  It is not as bad as I have heard some folks try to make it out to be, but when you have sweaty rubber boots, you will have some odor as a result.  The smell is not enough of an issue to affect my rating, but I don‚Äôt recommend that you wear these on a three day hunt then leave them locked up in your truck cab overnight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HKSGY8RLO9QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OORGORI#wasThisHelpful","R1HKSGY8RLO9QV","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, a quality work that I would recommend to readers interested in history.  On the books good points, the content and philosophical context are tremendous.  Riggenbach does a wonderful job exploring the fallacies of history being a simple collection of incontrovertible facts, and explains the concept of historical interpretation.  As the author so aptly explains, it tends not to be the who, what, and when that needs revisionism, it is the why of history that tends to receive way to little scrutiny.  The history of revisionism itself is also quite fascinating.  By far, the most beneficial value to the book is its discussion of historical topics from an anti-war viewpoint, and the wonderful array of authors and works referenced in the process.  On the books downsides, I did find the author's style to be a bit lacking in flow, and occasionally tedious.  The style tends to vary a bit by chapter, so some chapters were clear, concise, and entertaining; while others tended to be blocky or overly repetitive.  Also, it seems at times that Riggenbach has some favorites in the revisionist world for which he wants to sugar coat their overall political viewpoints in an effort to make them more palatable to those of the classical liberal persuasion (or as Raico would put it - just Liberal, as contemporary Liberals are no such thing).  Further, he asserts that the current libertarian movement within (a very small portion of) the American Republican party, is misplaced, and would be better set in the Democratic party.  While the point would be a good one from a pre-1900 historical standpoint, it seems to be pointless semantics considering the miserable big-government statism of both parties in the modern era.  This is not really that big of a detraction from the book, it just seems to be out of place and a bit of a strained lobbying effort.  If I were to recommend just one revisionist-style history, I would likely prefer either Murray Rothbard or Ralph Raico.  But why just read one history book?  The valuable content greatly outweighs any of the stylistic minutia that may not have perfectly fit my taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BFGJFYW91AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028Y4QEM#wasThisHelpful","R17BFGJFYW91AT","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very pretty swing, and it does seem to be holding up to the weathering process so far (although I have an extremely small sample size as it has only been outside for two months at this point).  Keep in mind that this is just that actual swing seat, and the ropes (with logging clamps to loop over the anchor point and attach the rope to itself).  The price does seem a bit high for just a swing seat, but this was purchased by my wife.  I constructed a frame on which to mount the swing out of treated pine, which even after staining does not have the visual appeal of the seat itself.  (For those that may construct a frame out of treated lumber, keep in mind that treated needs to be set out to dry for a couple of weeks prior to painting or staining, as it will be wet when purchased fresh).  The seat fits my 2 year old baby girl great, with plenty of room to grow into.  She can even get herself in and out without any assistance, since the safety rail easily slides straight up the rope.  All in all, seems to be a really well made swing,, but hard for me to get over the price (even for high quality rot proof wood species).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ29XVKYOKRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTWB096#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ29XVKYOKRR","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time of review, I have only had these bulbs in service for a little over a month, so it is still early to comment on the durability or length of life for the extra LED cost.  I will say that the LED's are much brighter than the traditional incandescent bulbs they replaced, and these are dimmable as advertised.  The only downside I have found so far, is quite specific to the particular use I purchased them for.  I used these as a replacement bulb for the overhead lights in my GE Monogram overhead range hood.  While they fit the connections perfectly, the cover on the LED bulbs is slightly thicker than the stock model incandescent lights included in the range, making the protective covers that fit over the lights difficult to get back into place after the lights are replaced.  As I said, this particular issue is rather specific to the intended use, but you may want to keep this in mind if you are placing the bulbs in a location that has covers for the lights.  If utilized as a can light without a cover, then this would certainly not be an issue what so ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0IGWAI3SC1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGZCVSW#wasThisHelpful","RT0IGWAI3SC1A","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To clarify, the actual deshedding comb (shown in the product photo) is not included.  This is simply an attachment that allows a Furminator brand comb to attach to the vacuum hose.  As several reviewers note, it would just as well to hold the vacuum hose in the other hand while you brush the dog.  This attachment does fit our central vac unit, on the upside, but the design is not great to prevent clogging.  Once you add the price of the Furminator brush (and it does have to be a Furminator as I tried several similar deshedding combs and none of the handles would fit in the attachment).

"Overall, this is a nice booster seat, as it is sturdy, resilient, and versatile.  It fits my 24 month old daughter quite well, with room left so she shouldn‚Äôt grow out of it too quickly.

We typically eat at our bar height island in the kitchen, and this booster attaches perfectly to our bar stool chairs (as they have chair backs but no arms).  Our daughter loves this one because she can slide up to the dining bar and eat beside us (so she feels like this one is a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù seat).  My wife loves this model because it is available in brown, so at least the kitchen can look like normal adults live there instead of cartoon characters.

"When I first starting researching buying some new trail cams, I was a bit skeptical of Browning, since it seemed like a situation where a well-known company was sticking their name on something outside their area of expertise ‚Äì but it turns out these very well may be the best trail cameras on the market.  Browning has two cameras in their sub-micro series currently, the Strike Force & the Dark Ops.  The Browning Strike Force was the highest rated trail cam for 2014, as it essentially changed the market and price points for trail cams, with a debut at $150 and features only available at the time in the $300 price point with other manufacturers.  I initially purchased the Browning Strike Force model since it was at the top of the rankings, and I was so pleased with its performance that I eventually purchased the Dark Ops model, as well.  I have been just as pleased with the Dark Ops model as I was with the Strike Force, as both models have identical features with the exception of the flash (Strike Force is a visible IR flash and Dark Ops is dark IR flash).  (More on the specifics regarding the differences between IR & dark IR flash technology later in the review).  The bottom line is the next trail camera I purchase will be another Browning Dark Ops.Dark Ops ‚Äì The Good:1.  Terrific Daytime Picture Quality ‚Äì 10MP2.  Terrific Battery Efficiency (even in video mode)3.  Dark IR - No visible flash to alert nearby humans of the camera‚Äôs presence4.  Good Night Quality (Black & White) & Good Flash Range (Comparable to Strike Force)4.  Great Versatility & Options ‚Äì The burst mode and timing adjustability are very handy5.  Lightning Fast Trigger Speed6.  Great Detection Range7.  Display for Battery Life & Remaining Photo Memory8.  Connection Port ‚Äì Camera works as SD card reader by connecting to PC or TVDark Ops ‚Äì The Bad:1.  Cheap Plastic Latch ‚Äì The plastic latch that closes the cover over the bottom half of the camera (control buttons, display, and SD card slot) is really easy to break.  You really have to consciously make sure everything is lined up correctly or this latch will just snap.  Several other reviewers for both Strike Force and Dark Ops have complained of this exact issue.  This is the only real complaint I have so far with either the Strike Force or Dark Ops, so it really would not deter me from purchasing another ‚Äì but it is something the manufacturer should correct on future models.  All the other items I could list are really more of a ‚Äúwish list‚Äù type item that would make the camera ideal, but in reality are not offered in other models in this price range yet either.Other Comments on Features:1.  No Field Viewer ‚Äì There is no viewer to preview photos in the field, or to check alignment (although for alignment purposes it does have a test mode which flashes as the camera detects motion within the detection area).  This would be a handy feature to check your alignment from the get go, but most cameras with this feature are quite a bit higher priced.3.  Motion Range ‚Äì The range of detection is slightly greater than the camera view, and coupled with the lightning fast trigger speed this can mean the first photo may go off before the subject comes into view.  I usually utilize the 2 shot burst feature, and by the 2nd photo your subject will be in view.  By the same token, because of this combination of features I have caught animals at a full speed run that otherwise would not have been in view with narrow detection & slower triggers.4.  Digital camera USB connection cable for connecting the trail cam to a PC or TV is not included.  The connection cable for my wife‚Äôs digital camera fit the trail cam, but I have used this feature a lot less than I thought I might.5.  SD Card Slot Access ‚Äì For those with big fingers, the SD card can be difficult to remove from this camera; and it is virtually impossible to do with gloves on.  I often have to carry some tweezers to assist in pulling the SD card out far enough until I can get a good grip with my fingers.  This issue really would not deter my purchase of this model, but it is certainly something the manufacturer should address in future model updates.  It really just needs a sturdier spring to push the card out further when ejected.Comparing Dark Ops Model versus Strike Force Model1.  Both are easy to use, have great daytime photo quality, and have terrific battery efficiency.  The only difference between the two camera model is the flash type, so the remainder of the comparison is basically a contrast of traditional IR versus dark IR flashes.2.  Night Photo Quality ‚Äì The only area in which the Strike Force has a slight edge over Dark Ops, but it is really not much of an edge at all.  The Dark Ops night photos are necessarily somewhat darker with the dark IR flash, so the clarity level is slightly affected.  Still the range for night photos for the Dark Ops, although slightly less than Strike Force, has been fairly impressive just the same.  Generally, I can only tell the difference between the flash ranges of the two models when they are set up in fairly open areas, i.e. they are nearly identical in thickly wooded areas.3.  Flash Visibility ‚Äì Strictly for deer trail camera purposes, the dark IR technology does very little, as although the deer can see the IR flash on the Strike Force, they become accustomed almost instantly.  The real difference for flash visibility is as it relates to humans.  Obviously, if you intend to use for security purposes, you should purchase the Dark Ops model.  Furthermore, if humans are likely to come within your hunting area, the dark IR prevents potential camera thieves from being alerted to the presence of the device at night.  The one usage related to hunting in which dark flash would be mandatory is for predator photography.  If you intend to use the trail cam to pattern predator movements for foxes, coyotes, and bobcats; then the dark IR is a must have.  I have captured three times as many predator photos on the Dark Ops model as I have the Strike Force.  When I have caught coyotes in video mode on the Strike Force, they immediately turn and run away from the light source; and when in trail cam mode they are always looking directly into the camera for the initial photo and gone from view in subsequent photos.  Whereas, I often catch both bobcats and coyotes in multi photo sets with the Dark Ops cam, and they usually do not show signs that they are aware of the camera at all.TipsHere are few tips for new users that I have picked up from my experience with this trail cam:1.  Purchase Lithium batteries - I had read that tip on a trail cam review site, and was wary at first since Lithium (AA type) are not rechargeable and are not cheap either, but I have had one camera in the field for over two months straight and the battery display still reads 100%.2.  Purchase two SD cards ‚Äì 8GB is plenty, even in video mode.3.  Buy a Cable Lock or Security Box - I have traditionally used a Python lock, but they can be cut with bolt cutters and I have had issues with keys breaking off in the lock.  Also, a trespasser still has access to the SD card when using just a cable lock, so a trespasser could simply steal the SD card to prevent from being recognized.  To protect from this, you would need to purchase the Browning security box.4.  Field Set Up - A strap is included with the camera, which will secure the camera to trees of probably 24 inches and under.  Keep in mind the height range for the intended target when securing the camera, as a trail cam set at 6 foot from the ground is not going to catch many deer or turkeys, but a camera set too low will probably catch more squirrels and raccoons than you want to see.  I recommend a height of approximately 30 inches for deer (depending on the topography), and slightly lower for turkeys.  Clear the ground immediately in front of the camera and remove limbs, tall grass, etc. out to at least 15 feet to minimize false triggers during windy conditions.  Limbs and other vegetation that are within a five foot range (directly in front of the flash) will also reflect light from the flash, and can slightly hamper photo quality.  Another consideration in winter is overhead limbs in case of icing.  I had one of my cameras to be completely blocked by a sagging pine tree for nearly a week after a recent ice storm.5.  Face it North (whenever possible) - Unless you have a spot in which you know you will be looking for either morning or afternoon photos, then you will want to aim the camera looking North (for those of us in the Northern hemisphere).  Shadows and glare will be much more manageable when the camera is facing North.6.  Settings - If you plan to set the camera up over an area that the animals may tend to linger, you probably want to minimize the burst mode (or don‚Äôt use burst mode at all), and keep the delay duration at five minutes (or longer).  On one occasion I set the burst on 3 photos, with a one minute delay, and ended up with nearly 2,000 photos in less than a week ‚Äì which does pretty much guarantee you will have good shots of every animal that walked through, but makes for a long sorting process when trying to establish patterns.  A two photo burst will capture most targets that were essentially just quickly walking by, and a five minute delay is pretty good timing for deer, which tend linger for a maximum of about twenty minutes in any single interval.Other Tools for Trail CamsAs an aside, there are several new web-based software applications coming on the market to help trail cam users garner useful pattern info from their trail cams.  These applications allow users to select trail cam locations using GPS & aerial satellite photos, and upload photos from each cam site.  The application then downloads local weather data for each site, and matches the photo time stamps with local weather conditions.  Specific animals can be tagged by photo.  This allows the application to utilize predictive algorithms to pattern a deer‚Äôs movements and predict your most likely areas for success based on predicted or current weather (and moon phase) conditions.  I have long complained about the significant gap between the information trail cams provide, and a simple way to fully utilize that information to determine the end means for most users (patternable deer movements).  Hopefully, some of the trail cam manufacturers will key in on these new applications and begin to include this type of software with their cameras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROILNT0CB7P31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHGAFMS#wasThisHelpful","ROILNT0CB7P31","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really pretty little table.

"Durability is questionable, at best, for this unit.  The countertop had already flaked off a large chunk before my 2 YO daughter even got a chance to use it.  The hinges and doors have held up so far, though, after nearly 3 months of use.  My biggest warning is that assembly will take a while for this unit.  Figure on four hours to construct with just one person (of better than average skill).  Just don't put it off until Christmas Eve, or just before a Birthday Party, and think you can assemble this tedious thing by yourself in a few minutes.  On the upside, the size fits well in the corner of a room without getting in the way, and aesthetically looks much better than most of the other pink & purple monstrosities.

I will note, however, that Premium Edge recommends transitioning to Premium Edge Healthy Weight II after weight loss has been achieved, but my dogs had terrible results with Premium Edge II.  Both dogs experienced diarrhea, vomiting, and skin irritation while on PE2.  I have found that PE1 does just as well as a weight maintenance food, as it does for weight loss, assuming you adjust the feeding volume.Bottom Line:  At roughly $1.41 per pound, this is the best value I have found yet for a 5 star grain-free food.  Premium Edge I has top tier ingredients at value brand pricing.  (But for as great as Premium Edge Healthy Weight I is, I do not at all recommend Premium Edge Healthy Weight II).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGUH4W2B738L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ML7S0#wasThisHelpful","R1VGUH4W2B738L","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have only recently purchased this particular model Dual Pro, so I have not had enough time to get a true test of the quality of the battery charger.  Although I have not had this particular model for a long period, I have owned a Dual Pro Sportsman‚Äôs Series, which was a very good charger.  I had the Sportsman‚Äôs Series on my bass boat for more than 10 years before it finally succumbed to the wear and tear.  I replaced it with a Pro Mariner brand, and was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of that charger.  The Pro Mariner did not last very long, but it managed to ruin a couple of expensive Deep Cycle batteries during its short tenure.  I knew I wanted to go back to Dual Pro this time, but I decided to step down to the Recreational Series to save a little money.  Installation was really easy, and it appears to have high quality components.  When I held this unit side by side with the Pro Mariner that I replaced, it was very easy to see that the Dual Pro was a far better built unit.  Also, the charging display lights for each battery are very easy to read on this charger.  With the Pro Mariner I always had to climb up in the boat and stick my head down to the battery well to see the indicators, but I can walk by and see everything I need to from outside the boat with the Dual Pro.It does take longer to completely recharge from a deep discharge with the 6 amp Dual Pro Recreational model versus the 10 amp Dual Pro Sportsman‚Äôs (the difference for my two 96 Amp hour AC Delco Deep Cycle batteries being 18 hours for the Recreational and 11 hours for the Sportsman‚Äôs), but I don‚Äôt need the capability of a quick full recharge very often anymore.  If you tournament fish a lot, you probably need a higher amp than 6 so that you can have a quick turnaround recharge.  For most users, the additional cost for higher amp chargers is not really worth it, because all it gets you is a quicker recharge time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8301253PLGUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RN4AXC#wasThisHelpful","R8301253PLGUX","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tremendously well written collection of essays.  Raico is a master and pulls no punches.

"This book is quite short and interesting, as well as a great value considering a price under five dollars.  I am biased towards the underlying philosophy, so my rating is skewed in that direction.  The book does hold a bit of a middle ground in that it does not delve quite deeply enough into the Non-Aggression Principle or the basics underlying Austrian Economic theory to be a great primer for those with no previous experience in libertarian literature; nor does it expand greatly on libertarian thought for readers fluent in Rothbard.  A quick read through some of the Amazon reviews and comments is proof positive in this point that many after reading the book still lacked even a fundamental understanding of the Non-Aggression Principle, wrongly asserting that a belief in this principle somehow requires a belief in the inherent morality of individuals (instead of libertarianism‚Äôs opposite contention which is that because men are not angels then we cannot expect them not to abuse the authority given to them to legitimize violence and coercion when done in service to the state).  That being said, this book does cover a large swath efficiently in a very small package.  The use of ""Manifesto"" in the subtitle could be misleading if the reader expects a thorough conceptual formualtion as found in Murray Rothbard's ""Libertarian Manifesto"", being as ""Against the State"" is really a collection of expounded essays that cover several topics in an attempt to demonstrate the validity of anarcho-capatialism as a societal alternative (and more so the culpability of the nation state in the murder and suffering of milllions).  At times Rockwell‚Äôs tone seems much harsher than that of his mentor‚Äôs, but overall Rockwell has a fine writing style all to his own.  I found his writings on the environmental movement to be very interesting, although I could see how the tone in his coverage of this topic could be very off-putting to some.  (Murray Rothbard‚Äôs discussion of environmentalism in his Libertarian Manifesto was much more from a positive stand point of the solutions to modern environmental problems which would be realized through property rights and full liability inherent in anarcho-capitalism; whereas, Rockwell turns the table in negatively exposing the nature of the origins and intentions of the statist environmental movement).  All in all, I recommend reading the book as a valuable investment, especially considering the short duration of time and small price required.  He also does a tremendous job of including recommended reading to further expound on the topics explored within this work.I should also note to the prospective reader that some of the criticisms found in these reviews are misleading.  Criticism that this book is filled with ‚Äújingoism‚Äù is completely ridiculous to my understanding of the term.  ‚ÄúJingoism‚Äù insinuates a hyper-nationalism, such as that required to gin up patriotic vigor to encourage imperialism and war-mongering.  Being as the fundamental theme of the book is anti-imperialism (anti-intervention) to promote peace and the well-being of individuals at the expense of the nation state, then I think it is self-explanatory why this would be an odd and totally ridiculous criticism.  Criticisms of the religious aspects of the book are equally curious.  Rockwell is advocating ultimate freedom, which would entail each individual‚Äôs ability to believe and worship as they wish (as long as they do not harm others or infringe on the rightful property of others).  I do see how Rockwell‚Äôs characterization of the modern environmental movement as having pagan origins could be off-putting, but I don‚Äôt think his inclusion of this need imply religous necessity to support his thesis, in as much as he is pointing out the flaws and inconsistencies within that movement‚Äôs supporters.  Another portion of the book‚Äôs criticisms stem from a complete misunderstanding of the concept of a human individual‚Äôs natural rights.  Belief in the concept of Natural Rights is ambivalent to religion.  Many libertarians arrive at the concept through personal religious beliefs, but Rothbard adequately described the concept using observation of the nature of man without any religious underpinning necessary.  If the prospective reader wishes to explore the philosophical concepts of liberty, then please do not be put off by misleading implications that this work advocates some type of ultra-conservatism.  Furthermore, I also see how some readers would find Rockwell‚Äôs characterization of some foreign powers to be objectionable in that he seemingly portrays some totalitarian regimes as rather benign.  In the context of this book, that criticism could be justified from a certain perspective, because in the interest of brevity he focuses mostly on the likelihood of these nations being a direct threat to the United States.  One would not have to look very far, though, to find Rockwell‚Äôs condemnation of these regimes in other writings, especially with respect to their murderous tendencies to their own people.  His discussion of these regimes with respect to their effect in balancing the power of other possibly even worse regimes should not be viewed as condoning them in any way, and was intended to display the unintended effects of our foreign interventionism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6CF65VJ5BJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KN0K6EM#wasThisHelpful","R3M6CF65VJ5BJQ","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The problem for me has been that the increase in bites has not translated yet into an increase in fish in the boat.  The high action tail seems to entice more bites out of finicky late summer fish, but the fish seem to be swiping at the tail often times and not necessarily taking the bait.  If bluegill are in the area, you can kiss the tail goodbye because they will strip the tail and legs off like thugs stripping a car in a bad neighborhood.  The body of the lizard is fairly durable and holds up on the hook well.  Unfortunately, to get the great action on the tail and legs, the trade off is a less dense plastic that does not stay attached to the body.  Fishing these all the time would get expensive considering the durability, but they are a good lizard to have in the box for finicky fish or for water conditions requiring a high action bait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF86507BKMG3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LKBL8S#wasThisHelpful","RF86507BKMG3S","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stren Clear Blue Fluorescent has been the only monofilament on my reels for years.  I typically fish reservoirs on the Tennessee River system (which are not particularly clear water) so I have always preferred the Clear Blue Fluorescent color, because it is much easier for me to see the line compared to the regular ""clear"" color. I had some bad experiences with Trilene years ago, and have not varied from Stren for monofilamnet since.  Line is like most everything else in the fishing world in that it boils down to a matter of preference, but I have always been satisfied with Stren Original monofilament.  The only other fishing line that I can say I have the same affinity for would be Spiderwire Stealth in the braided line.  I have yet to find a fluorocarbon line that I do not have some complaint about.  To be fair, though, I have not spent a tremendous amount of time fishing fluorocarbon since I do not fish a lot of extremely clear water.

"I have had the Hydro-flo box for approximately one month (at the time of this review) and like the product so far.  I was initially worried that treble hook points might protrude through the tiny holes causing an aggravation, but so far that has not been an issue. I have been using the 3700 size for storing lipless crankbaits, and it seems to fit the application well.  The concept certainly seems like it should work well for hard baits that you switch colors or sizes often and place the baits back in the box while still wet (such as crankbaits and rattletraps).  I have not had the product long enough yet to determine if it really helps deter corrosion of the baits.  I would not recommend this box for storing items that you would not typically place back in the box wet, such as swivels, weights, and other terminal tackle.  The box seems to be well made and durable, and has quality latches.

"I have traditionally fished Stealth braid in the Moss Green color, and have always liked the line in general.  Recently I purchased the new GloVis color in 40 lb test, and have had good results with it so far, as well.  I did notice while fishing side by side with someone fishing the Moss green Stealth that the new Glo-Vis is much easier to see in sunlight.  Prior to a side by side comparison I would not have thought there was much difference in the two colors by just looking.  I have only been fishing the new Glo-Vis for five or six weeks, so I do not know how durable the color treatment of the line will be.  The remainder of this review pertains to Spiderwire Stealth in general, and is not necessarily specific to the new Glo-Vis colored product.The ""Stealth"" version of Spiderwire is Teflon impregnated, which helps correct some of the issues typically associated with traditional braided lines.  I have never fished Power Pro or Sufix 832, so I cannot accurately compare the Stealth performance to those lines, but I have always been pleased with Stealth so I have not had reason to try a higher-end braid.  I can say the Stealth version performs much better than Spiderwire Original. For those that have never fished braid, the sensitivity is exponentially better than traditional monofilament, so for certain applications it is far superior to mono or fluoro lines (see ""Braid Tips"" below if you have no experience at all with braided style line).  Below I have covered some of the aspects of Stealth, as well as included a line diameter chart for comparing to monofilament test weight.Comparison Reference for Stealth Braid diameter to Monofilament - Below is a comparison chart for reference to determine the comparable monofilament line diameter for each Stealth test weight class.20 lb Stealth = 6 lb mono30 lb Stealth = 8 lb mono40 lb Stealth = 10 lb mono50 lb Stealth = 12 lb mono65 lb Stealth = 15 lb mono80 lb Stealth = 17 lb mono100 lb Stealth = 20 lb monoCapacity for the 125 yd Package -85 lb Test: The 125 yard spool is enough to spool two low-profile baitcasters and have some left over, assuming you back the reels with some monofilament (which is recommended).50 lb Test: The 125 yard spool will fill one low-profile baitcast reel and have approximately 40 yd left over (depending on how much backing is used).40 lb Test:  Most low profile baitcasters will hold approximately 120 yards of 40 lb diameter Stealth on a full spool, so even with backing on the reel it will take 80% of the 125 yd package to fill the spool.  For a round baitcast reel (like the Abu 5500c), it will basically use up 95% of the 125 yd package to fill the reel.30 lb Test: A medium sized spinning reel (e.g. Shimano 2500 class) takes approximately 90 yards to fill, so the 125 yard spool will fill one reel and have 35 to 50 yards left over (depending on whether you use mono backing).Durability - I have honestly never had any of this line wear out.  The color will fade after a few months, but that doesn't seem to have any effect on line performance.  I have had the same line (50 lb) on my Texas Rig outfit for 3 years, and have not had any breaks (but have straitened more than a few hooks hanging a brush pile or a stump).  Stealth is a polyethylene microfiber braid that has a feel somewhat like thread, and has zero line memory.  So whereas mono would be rendered useless just by staying spooled on the reel for months on end, the Spiderwire is unaffected in that manner.Castability - Frankly, for most applications this stuff casts better than monofilament.  The 40 & 50 lb sizes are highly versatile baitcaster sizes and cast extremely well with a variety of baits.  The 30 lb is really too small diameter to use on baitcast reels, but works well on medium to medium large spinning reels for certain applications.Value - Stealth lasts much longer than mono due to the lack of line memory, so it is hard to compare prices to traditional monofilament (as in my experience the braid can last several years).  The Teflon treatment makes Stealth much more fishable than the value brand braids.Noise - Some braids are noisy.  I have never noticed this issue with the smaller diameter Stealth (30 -50lb), but the 80 lb is fairly loud when throwing out heavy Alabama rigs and winding them back in.  Obviously this is not a performance issue; it is just an annoyance to some folks who prefer mono or fluorocarbon line.  According to Spiderwire's marketing the Teflon treatment is supposed to help quite the line, hence the ""Stealth"" moniker, but I do not know if that has any validity.Applications - I first started fishing this line bottom bumping for catfish and sauger (in winter) on the Tennessee River in deepwater current (30 - 60 ft deep).  The sensitivity of this line makes it perfect for this type of fishing, as you feel subtle changes in the river bed and light bites are easily detected.  For bottom bumping, I prefer 40 lb on baitcast reels, or 30 lb on spinning outfits.  Heavier line will work, but assuming braid compatible knots are tied there is really no need for heavier lines (I am typically fishing for schooling blue or channel catfish that are smaller than 10 lbs). For bass fishing, I love the 40 or 50 lb size for fishing plastics, on either Texas or Carolina rigs.  I have read that a lot of professionals do not like using braid for Carolina rigs, due to the lack of line stretch for hooksets, but I always use braid for a Carolina main line since I do not have the feel that the pro's do so I need a little more sensitivity in the line (and if I miss a hookset it does not cost me anything).  The 85 lb size works great for throwing extremely large baits, such as Alabama rigs (umbrella rig).  I also use the 30 lb size on spinning outfits fishing cork (bobber) rigs for spawning channel cats in the spring.Braid Tips - Fishing braid is a little different than traditional monofilament, so I have listed a few characteristics and tips specific to this type of braided line for those with no experience fishing braid.  I am certainly not a professional fisherman (so take with a grain of salt), but here are few things I have picked up concerning braided line.  Braid will dig in to itself, so it is a good idea to back the reel with a small amount of monofilament.  After a hard hookset, or especially if you get hung, it is a good idea to let the line back out and rewind it, or you will probably backlash the next cast.  It casts better wet, so I usually let some line out to get it wet before I start fishing or start with shorter casts.  I have read some complaints on the web concerning the line strength of some braided lines, and for the most part I think those complaints can be attributed to incorrect knots.  Zero memory braid has such different characteristics from traditional monofilament (and even fluorocarbon), that many knots that work well on traditional line will not hold on braided line.  A quick internet search will yield several recommendations for appropriate knot types to use with braid.  With a correct knot it is almost impossible to break off 40+ lb braid, so it is a good idea to have some scissors capable of cutting the line available in case you get hung up.  Braid is not abrasion resistant, though, so it is a good idea to keep an eye on your line if you are fishing around sharp rocks or heavy snags.  You can usually see if the line starts to fray a bit.  Another source of abrasion on the line can be older bullet-style lead weights that have burrs or rough spots, as these can easily fray the line when the line slides through these weights (newer precision milled weights do not have these issues).  Some spinning reels have features that can adjust the way the line is spooled on the reel, which makes fishing braid on a spinning outfit a little easier.  It is a good idea to check the instruction manual of your spinning reels to see if they have this option.  I discuss the applications of Stealth earlier in this review, but from an overview standpoint, braid works really well for fishing applications that require a lot of sensitivity and feel (e.g. Texas/Carolina rigs, jigs, bottom fishing) due to the total lack of stretch in the line.

"I have been fishing Stealth (Moss Green color) in the medium diameters (30-50 lb) for several years, and have really liked this line.  I have only recently tried the 80 lb version, and so far have had success with it as well.  The ""Stealth"" version of Spiderwire is Teflon impregnated, which helps correct some of the issues typically associated with traditional braided lines.  I have never fished Power Pro or Sufix 832, so I cannot accurately compare the Stealth performance to those lines, but I have always been pleased with Stealth so I have not had reason to try a higher-end braid.  I can say the Stealth version performs much better than Spiderwire Original. For those that have never fished braid, the sensitivity is exponentially better than traditional monofilament, so for certain applications it is far superior to mono or fluoro lines (see ""Braid Tips"" below if you have no experience at all with braided style line).  Below I have covered some of the aspects of Stealth, as well as included a line diameter chart for comparing to monofilament test weight.Comparison Reference for Stealth Braid Diameter to Equivalent Monofilament Diameter -20 lb Stealth = 6 lb mono30 lb Stealth = 8 lb mono40 lb Stealth = 10 lb mono50 lb Stealth = 12 lb mono65 lb Stealth = 15 lb mono80 lb Stealth = 17 lb mono100 lb Stealth = 20 lb monoCapacity of the 125 yd Package -85 lb Test: The 125 yard spool is enough to spool two low-profile baitcasters and have some left over, assuming you back the reels with some monofilament (which is recommended).50 lb Test: The 125 yard spool will fill one low-profile baitcast reel and have approximately 40 yd left over (depending on how much backing is used).40 lb Test:  Most low profile baitcasters will hold approximately 120 yards of 40 lb diameter Stealth on a full spool, so even with backing on the reel it will take at least 80% of the 125 yd package to fill the reel.  For a round baitcast reel (like the Abu 5500c), it will basically use up 95% of the 125 yd package to fill the reel.30 lb Test: A medium sized spinning reel (e.g. Shimano 2500 class) takes approximately 90 yards to fill, so the 125 yard spool will fill one reel and have 35 to 50 yards left over (depending on whether you use mono backing).Durability - I have honestly never had any of this line wear out.  The color will fade after a few months, but that doesn't seem to have any effect on line performance.  I have had the same line (50 lb) on my Texas Rig outfit for 3 years, and have not had any breaks (but have straitened more than a few hooks hanging a brush pile or a stump).  Stealth is a polyethylene microfiber braid that has a feel somewhat like thread, and has zero line memory.  So whereas mono would be rendered useless just by staying spooled on the reel for months on end, the Spiderwire is virtually unaffected in that manner.Castability - Frankly, for most applications this stuff casts better than monofilament.  The 40 & 50 lb sizes are highly versatile baitcaster sizes and cast extremely well with a variety of baits.  The 30 lb is really too small diameter to use on baitcast reels, but works well on medium to medium large spinning reels for certain applications.Value - Stealth lasts much longer than mono due to the lack of line memory, so it is hard to compare prices to traditional monofilament (as in my experience the braid can last several years).  The Teflon treatment makes Stealth much more fishable than the value brand braids.Noise - Some braids are noisy.  I have never noticed this issue with the smaller diameter Stealth (30 -50lb), but the 80 lb is fairly loud when throwing out heavy Alabama rigs and winding them back in.  Obviously this is not a performance issue; it is just an annoyance to some folks who prefer mono or fluorocarbon line.Applications - I first started fishing this line bottom bumping for catfish and sauger (in winter) on the Tennessee River in deepwater current (30 - 60 ft deep).  The sensitivity of this line makes it perfect for this type of fishing, as you feel subtle changes in the river bed and light bites are easily detected.  For bottom bumping, I prefer 40-50 lb on baitcast reels, or 30 lb on spinning outfits.  Heavier line will work (on baitcast reels), but assuming braid compatible knots are tied there is really no need for lines heavier than 50 lb test (I am typically fishing for schooling blue or channel catfish that are smaller than 10 lbs). For bass fishing, I love the 40 or 50 lb size for fishing plastics, on either Texas or Carolina rigs.  I have read that a lot of professionals do not like using braid for Carolina rigs, due to the lack of line stretch for hooksets, but I always use Stealth braid for a Carolina main line since I do not have the feel that the pro's do so I need a little more sensitivity in the line (and if I miss a hookset it does not cost me any $$$).  The 85 lb size works great for throwing extremely large baits, such as Alabama rigs (umbrella rig).  I also use the 30 lb size on spinning outfits fishing cork (bobber) rigs for spawning channel cats in the spring.Braid Tips - Fishing braid is a little different than traditional monofilament, so I have listed a few characteristics and tips specific to this type of braided line for those with no experience fishing braid.  I am certainly not a professional fisherman (so take with a grain of salt), but here are few things I have picked up concerning braided line.  Braid will dig in to itself, so it is a good idea to back the reel with a small amount of monofilament.  After a hard hookset, or especially if you get hung, it is a good idea to let the line back out and rewind it back on to the reel, or you will probably backlash the next cast.  It casts better wet, so I usually let some line out to get it wet before I start fishing or start with shorter casts and progressively get longer.  I have read some complaints on the web concerning the line strength of some braided lines, and for the most part I think those complaints can be attributed to incorrect knots.  Zero memory braid has such different characteristics from traditional monofilament (and even fluorocarbon or hybrid supelines), that many knots that work well on traditional line will not hold on braided line.  A quick internet search will yield several recommendations for appropriate knot types to use with braid.  With a correct knot it is almost impossible to break off 40+ lb braid, so it is a good idea to have some scissors capable of cutting the line available in case you get hung up.  Braid is not extremely abrasion resistant, though, so it is a good idea to keep an eye on your line if you are fishing around sharp rocks or heavy snags.  You can usually see if the line starts to fray a bit.  Another source of abrasion on the line can be older bullet-style lead weights that have burrs or rough spots, as these can easily fray the line when the line slides through these weights (newer precision milled weights do not have these issues).  Some spinning reels have features that can adjust the way the line is spooled on the reel, which makes fishing braid on a spinning outfit a little easier.  It is a good idea to check the instruction manual of your spinning reels to see if they have this option.  I discuss the applications of Stealth earlier in this review, but from an overview standpoint, braid works really well for fishing applications that require a lot of sensitivity and feel (e.g. Texas/Carolina rigs, jigs, bottom fishing) due to the total lack of stretch in the line.  By the same token, the total lack of stretch can make braid less than ideal for fishing applications that require some shock absorption (e.g. crankbaits, topwaters, spinnerbaits).  The overall strength of the line makes it the only choice for fishing extremely heavy cover or throwing extremely heavy baits such as the Alabama Rig.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1PSUL3ZWHAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036U20QS#wasThisHelpful","RB1PSUL3ZWHAW","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This buzzbait is a quality made product.  The arm is heavy-duty wire which should prove to be very durable.  This bait tracks extremely true, and can be fished very slowly.  The º oz version is good for catching some of the smaller ‚Äúbuck‚Äù (male largemouth) bass around boathouses and shoreline structure for some late evening summertime fun.  You really need to fish it on lighter line to throw it well (10 lb mono works pretty good), and you are not going to make extremely long casts with it anyway.  If you are looking for something to cover a lot of ground, you definitely need to go with the heavier version to get any big casting distance, but I do highly recommend the small ¬º oz version for those looking for some ‚Äúfun‚Äù fishing, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFCLRW8SL18B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QFW4F6#wasThisHelpful","R2LFCLRW8SL18B","A1B2LEW6RAFIKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B2LEW6RAFIKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So far, though, it's held up well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCFKOCNTYGJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FO8W2I#wasThisHelpful","RUCFKOCNTYGJN","A2480CI91NG7U7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2480CI91NG7U7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mountain House meals are not for eating at home.  This product will not compete well with beef stew lovingly prepared in a crock pot with fresh ingredients...duh.But on the trail these things are awesome.  They are nearly weightless and are simple to prepare.  There are only three ways to screw these things up, 1) forget to remove the desiccant packet, 2) fail to use BOILING water, and 3) spill it.My only complaint?  Too many peas.I think this is the second best tasting flavor (after chicken and rice)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8E50EW55CWUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OPJW40#wasThisHelpful","R8E50EW55CWUB","A2480CI91NG7U7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2480CI91NG7U7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is perfect for camping.  And it tastes great...while camping.  But let's get real, it's not good spaghetti.  In fact, it's not really spaghetti at all.  It's more like spaghetti inspired soup.That said, it's pretty good spaghetti soup.  After a day of hiking, it tastes damn near gourmet after eating nothing but Cliff bars and water all day.  I would never eat one at home, but on the trail a hot meal really hits the spot.  They're idiot proof (unless you forget to remove the dessicant), light, and durable.  They provide loads of calories and carbohydrates.  They help me feel warm at night and keep me energized through my cold breakfast and lunch.If I had to rank this flavor, I'd place it 4th (after #1 chicken and rice, #2 beef stew, and #3 beef stroganoff)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IRURYI86K2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YRJ58#wasThisHelpful","R27IRURYI86K2R","A2480CI91NG7U7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2480CI91NG7U7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gabe and IsabellaThis has been my favorite book in the series thus far. I really enjoyed the banter between Gabe and Iz. He is such an alpha male that at times all you can do is shake your head and laugh at him. But he also has you trembling with desire! Isabella is a broke woman. She is mentally beat down and is never to sure of what one says is what they mean.Gabe has watched Isabella from a far for so long. He may be an ass of a man but he does have  values. He knows when something isn't his and to stay away. But when one throws it away, don't think he won't swoop her up! He has waited long enough and has to tread carefully. If he wants Isabella bad enough he will have to treat her with kid gloves and that isn't something this man is use to.Isabella is use to people leaving her. And when the man she has invested so much time in lets her down she starts to realize she needs to get out. He has mentally beat her down that she truly believes she is better off alone. When Gabe steps in and saves her at her lowest point she feels more that she should. But can she really believe in a happily ever after? Can she stand on her own? And will she believe in herself enough to overcome the damage her past has put on her?I loved this story! I hope this review will help you to decide to get this book!! I highly recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVM0GZF17EVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRKQ08Q#wasThisHelpful","RVVM0GZF17EVS","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was very, VERY INTENSE. I felt like I was on pins and needles the whole time. There is something happening around every corner. You can't skip anything because you will miss everything.Avery and Grey's story.Avery is the younger sibling to Ian, Scott, Tyler and Olivia (her whole siblings). She was the one to save her half sister on her fathers side with a bone marrow transfusion. At the early age of nine she started to have panic and anxiety attacks. As she has grown she has learned to handle them, with counseling and medication. So to say that she has been through a lot is an understatement. And as a senior in high school she fell in love with Grey, only to have him leave and chase after his dreams leaving her broken, alone and feeling abandoned. Now that he is back and ready to amend the relationship she has all of her old feelings coming to the surface again. And to top it off, she now has a stalker. Can she really handle being thrown into Greys world? Or will the pressure be too much?Grey had something to prove. To himself, and his family. Leaving Avery was the hardest thing he's ever had to do. Now he is back, and ready to bare it all to Avery. Is he really what she needs, or is his world what will ruin her? All he wants is Avery but what at what cost? Someone is threatening her life and he will do what ever he can to be her protecting and prove that he is here to stay.Loved this book and can't wait frontage next siblings story!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U6KGKQUIDT37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN2SJAM#wasThisHelpful","R2U6KGKQUIDT37","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Shethinks this is going to be the start to her writing career, but soon realizes she wasjust hired to be her boss‚Äôs secretary. Alone and depressed, she turns to her boss‚Äôshusband for company.She knows this is wrong; after all, she is mad at her mother and stepbrother for thesame kind of actions. When the situation gets out of hand, Emma returns to the US.On the plane ride from LA to New York, she is seated next to her high school crush.Jaken Tanner is now the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He is even moregorgeous than he was before. There is a strong connection between the two of them,and they both decide to take a chance on each other.Jaken has some demons of his own. He has a wonderful son from his ex-wife butstruggles every day to let go of his past. His wife overdosed in front of his son and hecan‚Äôt forgive her. When Jaken sees a blast from his past on a plane from LA to NY, heis shocked at the feelings he has for Emma.She is absolutely gorgeous and has always been a caring person. He really wants togive a relationship a try with Emma. He can tell that she is holding back somethingfrom him though.Emma‚Äôs self esteem is so low that she doesn‚Äôt trust her feelings or Jaken‚Äôs. Her pastwon‚Äôt let her move forward: the guilt she carries is too much and she is afraid thatJaken will leave her if he knew the truth.This was a great love story. I really liked Jaken‚Äôs part of the story but I found Emma‚Äôslacking a bit at times. I thought that the author could have made her situation a bitmore angsty. Everything about her was just kind of quickly summed up at the end. Ithought her boss‚Äôs husband causing a bit more trouble at the end or something likethat would have added to the story.Overall a pretty good story: I really enjoyed reading it.

"This is an intense and deliciously dark love story that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of and didn‚Äôt want toever end! I literally could not put this book down and was upset when it ended because I wanted thereto be more! This book has everything I love and need in a great love story and definitely checks all of theboxes for me and I think I truly wanted this book to go on forever since I was enjoying reading it as muchas I was. In fact, my only complaint about this book is that it ended and I think that‚Äôs saying something.This is a highly complex love story that is full of grit and pain and is about two people being broughttogether in the wake of a tragedy and being able to find love in the darkness. Amy‚Äôs sister was abductedby the Mexican mafia and forced into sexual slavery and this tore a hole through Amy and her life hasnever been the same since the day she received word that her sister was murdered by those who hadabducted her. Her sister‚Äôs boyfriend at the time, biker gang member Jacko is a member of the MoroadMotorcycle Club and he has vowed to kill each and every single person involved in the death of Amy‚Äôssister and has even gone as far as to turn it into a mission he doesn‚Äôt plan on coming back from. TheMexican Mafia, known as the Los Li has now turned their sights onto Amy in order to lure Jacko awayfrom his mission and now he‚Äôs forced to bring her into his world in order to keep her alive. This issomething he vowed never to do and changes everything for the both of them forever.I absolutely loved this story since it was so much more than the typical love story with the usualhappily ever after. This story is about something horrible happening that has basically broken twopeople and changed their lives forever and how something truly beautiful and precious can come out ofsomething so devastating. Reading stories like these resonate the most with me simply because real lifeisn‚Äôt always roses and butterflies in the stomach and I can personally relate on a deeper level withstories when they are more realistic and have an element of the darker side of human nature workedinto the story line. I personally believe that beauty can come from tragedy and this story sends apowerful message that we should never give up on finding our happiness that each and every one of usdeserves to experience, no matter what our past experiences have been. I only wish there were more ofthese types of stories out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIVTDDJEF3NZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GPZIPI#wasThisHelpful","RIVTDDJEF3NZD","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"S.R. Grey's Tomorrow's Lies packs quite a powerful punch! Emotionally charged,it deals with the foster care system. We tend to think of the children in the foster system as troubled,but fail to think about how they became troubled. For many it was due to their biological parents! I swear, some people don't deserve the gift of procreation,but a jail cell instead! The same stands true with foster parents,some are in it only for the monthly check! That's not to say that all foster homes are bad. Some people really care about the children, and want to make their lives better! It's true,as we find in S.R. Grey's passionate story, the system is imperfect and overcrowded. I believe there is a special place in Heaven for the Great ""foster warriors! I can't say enough about the good ones. As for the bad ones,well,I would be watching over my shoulder if I were you! I'm so happy that the author wrote this book!

"This is a highly intense and gripping story that held my attention from the first page to the last!This story is fast paced and loaded with corruption, deceit, and tense situations. Ryan is a woman whohas searched her entire life for the reason behind her parents‚Äô brutal murder when she was a child. Shebelieves it to have been at the hands of the man who she knew as her uncle and protector. She‚Äôssacrificed everything in order to find out the truth of what happened that night and won‚Äôt stop until sheknows. She‚Äôs gone as far as to infiltrate a local group of skinhead bikers in order to gather informationshe believes the leader possesses. Everything seems to be going according to plan until the day the sexystranger walks through the door and changes everything. Bronx is on a mission of his own and his lifedepends on its successful completion no matter what it takes. Not being able to get the beautifulgirlfriend of one of the gang members out of his head wasn‚Äôt part of the plan.This was a dark and thrilling love story that was gritty in nature and I loved every minute ofreading this! My heart goes out to Ryan from the minute I read about her past experiences and the factthat she‚Äôs dedicated her entire life and sacrificed everything in order to discover the truth about thedeath of her parents. The idea of a child losing both of her parents in one night and being left entirelyalone is devastating and I wanted nothing more than for her to finally find the peace she so rightfullydeserved. Bronx is a dark force who harbors many secrets of his own and he feels an immediate andintense connection towards Ryan that completely changes everything for the both of them. Bronx iswilling to do whatever it takes in order to help Ryan get what she needs and puts his life on the line inorder to make this happen. This story is told from both Ryan and Bronx‚Äôs perspectives and I found this tobe extremely helpful in being able to better understand where each of them stood on an emotional levelas the story progressed. The interactions between the two were intense and it almost seemed as ifthey‚Äôd known each other before given the fact of how comfortable they were with each other from thestart. It made me feel as if they were meant to be together. This was an interesting look into theextreme lifestyle and hierarchy of gangs and I found it fascinating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKFB48T47ZRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168ROEGE#wasThisHelpful","R1PKFB48T47ZRF","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To say my mind was BLOWN by the conclusion of Mackenzie and Tyler's story would be a COMPLETE UNDERSTATEMENT!!! I have read EVERY book by TK Leigh. This story has to be one in its own. There is so much detail that has been put into it that I am just flabbergasted. Seriously!! Where does one think of these things! Lol. You thinking I'm exaggerating, I am impressed at the work that went into it. After reading this book I can honestly see why it took so long for it to come out. This wasn't something that you could write in a when. It is very well thought out and planned. Nothing was left out. No stone wasn't uncovered. It is pure genius!! Hats off to the author. The only thing that bothered me was that with all the detail, it was hard to keep up. If you skipped even a paragraph you would and could be lost. I had to step away more than a few times while reading this story. If I don't I was afraid that I would miss something.Mackenzie is left to question EVERYTHING she ever thought to be real. Or even fake for that matter. Was Tyler real? Or did she just imagine him up? Does she want love so much that she would hallucinate her perfect turtle dove? There are a lot of questions that she needs answers to. But what will it cost her? She has lost so much. Can she finally get the answers she needs? Will the truth really be what she is hoping for? And will Tyler be the man she needs?Tyler has given Mackenzie what she asked for, to leave her alone. The thing is, he hasn't, not really. He thinks of her everyday, every person he sees is her. He is a lost soul without her. He does one thing though, he continues to protect her, even from afar. But when things seem to become clear, will he stay away? He may have lied about who he was and what he did but he never lied about loving her. Now he is determined to make things right. Will it be to late? Can he find the truth that Mack needs? Only time will tell, let's just hope it doesn't run out!If you pass on this story, that is your own fault! It is an amazing story! So hold on tight and pay close attention! Enjoy!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI79YIA325DGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YDZ4XA#wasThisHelpful","RI79YIA325DGZ","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well written and highly enjoyable romance story about a woman named Lovey whocomes to stay with her professional hockey player brother Duncan while she makes some major lifechanges. Lovey has just gotten out of a serious relationship and quit her job and is ready for a fresh newstart. The one thing she wasn‚Äôt expecting though was her brother‚Äôs current roommate and Captain oftheir hockey team Marc. Marc is tall, dark, handsome, French and sexy as sin and Lovey knows she‚Äôs indeep trouble when it comes to this man from the second she lays eyes on him. To make matters evenmore interesting the three are now living together and it‚Äôs almost impossible to avoid each other. Theyeven share a bathroom.  Duncan warns Marc and their entire hockey team off of his little sister from dayone. Too bad Marc doesn‚Äôt listen to the warnings and he and Lovey can‚Äôt keep their hands off eachother. They decide to keep their bedroom activities a secret from her brother for many reasons andsneak time together whenever they can like two teenage lovers. This becomes a problem over timehowever since neither of them like sneaking around and lying to her brother about what‚Äôs really goingon. The big problem is what exactly is going on? This was supposed to be a fun and no strings attachedtype of situation and suddenly it‚Äôs not. Now things have entered into complicated territory and Loveyand Marc will need to decide just exactly what type of relationship they want to have and how they feelabout each other.I really enjoyed reading this book and it definitely checked all of the boxes for me. There werelots of good feels and sweet heart melting moments where Lovey and Marc let their guards down andallow themselves to just simply be in the moment and enjoy each other‚Äôs company. These were myfavorite parts of reading this story because it was touching to see them falling for each other. The littlethings they did for each other and how much they missed each other when they couldn‚Äôt be togetherwere not only touching to read about, but realistic in a newfound budding relationship. This made itextremely easy for me to relate to their characters as people finding and falling in love and helped me toreally be able to see things from both of their perspectives and truly want things to work out for them asa couple. This book tells the story from both Marc and Lovey‚Äôs perspectives and I really enjoyed beingable to see into each of their minds first hand every step of the way as the story progressed. There is agood amount of character development that takes place here as well, especially in Lovey‚Äôs case. At thebeginning of the story she is looking for a fresh start, but hasn‚Äôt quite figured out exactly how to goabout achieving that and there‚Äôs quite a bit of immaturity and naivety in her character. By the end shehas established a definite direction in life and quite a bit of growth has taken place.

Noah was drunk and high,about to make matters worse when he called Kit (AKA Kathleen). She ran over to where he was,and helped wrestle his demons back into their cage!  By breaking her heart years earlier,he feels that he has saved her. Is the reason he broke her heart years ago,less than noble? No matter how hard he had tried to stay away from her,he couldn't. I truly believe that he is in L-O-V-E with Kit! Of course there is a Whole lot more to the story,and I couldn't help but feel Excitement as Noah And Kit become closer!

"Meg and Miles had this instant connection, I wouldn't say love at first sight but it was definitely lust at first sight. After trying to resist Miles fails, Meg decided to try a no strings relationship. Neither one was interested in more then a sexual thing, because both have deep seeded trust issues.

This time instead of a man bent on revenge or a half sister who feels slighted, it's Ren and Ash themselves who are tested. Ash feels the next step for them is the biggest one yet.

"I can honestly say that I don't know if I have ever read a book that gave so much attention to detail. The information and description that went into this book were unimaginable. Someone did some serious Intel. The way the characters are described has to be because someone actually went through some of this. There is so much thought that was put out there. No one could make this stuff up. It is gut wrenching to read at times, but so worth it in the end. This story does have a HEA, but it takes heart and dedication to get there. I will have to say that if you have ever been to war there could be some triggers in some areas of this book. It isn't pretty at times but war isn't pretty, it is ugly and horrible. With all that said, I loved this book. I loved the characters and the way their paths went. Love isn't easy, life doesn't go the way we want but when the stars come together, and souls are found it can be a beautiful thing even when there is the ugly. This is a story that will stay with you for a lifetime. BRAVO to the authors and I want to say THANK YOU to all of the servicemen and women who fight everyday for our freedom. There aren't enough words! Thank you for keeping my family safe. Thank you to  the men and women who have lost their lives to keep us safe.Devin and Katie met when they were kids on the playground. They may have gotten in trouble that day but that is what brought them together and made them become best friends. Over the years the friendship grew and eventually they found that they were more than friends, they were soul mates. Meant to be together. But sometimes life gets in the way and what we want is what we can't have.10 years, it has been 10 years since Katie has seen or heard from Devin. She has a traumatic event happen and even though she is ""fine"" she agrees to therapy to satisfy her mom and sister. Little did she know that through her therapist she would be led to the one boy/man that has always been the one to help her through. But with the history they have can she really trust him. Devin is the one thing that can truly break her.Devin has be though a lot. His childhood was anything but pleasant. The only thing he could look forward to was Katie. She was his light, she helped him through so much. She was his. But when he had to leave things/life got in the way. Now 10 years later he is in the Army, and hell, literally if he had to describe hell it would be Bagdad. It is horrible!

Come hell or high water he won't let her down again.Will the stars align, will destiny keep them together this time? Can Devin keep his promise this time? Or will war keep them from coming back to one another?This is an epic love story! One they literally wrote a book about.

"The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is because of all the dialogue changing. It was a bit confusing jumping from person to person. Outside of that, it was pretty incredible. Ara is a very strong female lead who's been thrown into a situation that has her fearing her life. She has to do what she must to survive and protect others who are just like her. Carter hates her due to their past, but be feels drawn to her and can't fight his feelings for her when she's around.

"This is a great fast paced story full of witches, murder, betrayal and non-stop action! Sarah is astraight laced college student who works really hard at keeping her grades up and doesn‚Äôt ever get intotrouble. Everything‚Äôs about to change for her and even those closest to her aren‚Äôt what they seem.Sarah‚Äôs best friend Karen is actually a witch who‚Äôs just joined a dark coven and she‚Äôs been tasked withhelping to recruit Sarah into the fold. Sarah is believed to be a powerful witch who is destined tobecome the host of a reincarnated, long dead and very dark witch named Brenna and the coven willstop at nothing to make this happen. Two brothers lead the coven named Morcant and Blake and whilethey are both considered to be dark witches, Blake shows several times throughout this story that hehas a heart and truly cares about Sarah and her best friend. He is very obviously confused over his deepand profound feelings for Sarah and has never felt this strongly about anyone before. Even thoughBlake‚Äôs intentions are not quite clear the entire time and I found myself constantly questioning wherehis true loyalties lie, I must admit that I really liked him and my heart melted over how protective he wastowards Sarah. I desperately hoped that Blake and Sarah would find a way to get through it all and beable to be happy together in the end.This is not your typical romance in the fact that the love aspect definitely takes a backseat to allof the constant action and suspense going on the entire time. This was a refreshing change for me sincemost romance books I‚Äôve read lately have very little action and focus mostly on the relationships goingon. This book has a little bit of everything and is a great read! Relationships are tested, boundaries arecrossed, spells are cast and lives are drastically changed within the pages of this book! I loved everysecond of reading this and loved all of the constant twists and turns! Each and every single time Ithought I had what was about to happen figured out the story would take a sharp turn and go off in anentirely new direction. I love that this kept me guessing and it definitely held my interest to the very lastpage! This is the first book I‚Äôve read by this author and it definitely won‚Äôt be the last!

"This is one of the best books I‚Äôve read in quite a while! This is a dark read that covers subjectmatter that some may find offensive, but it is extremely well written and handled so well that I literallycould not put this book down! When I first started reading this I was honestly a little apprehensive aboutreading this book since the entire situation seems a bit off from page one and only gets stranger fromthere. Keep reading! I am so thankful that I stuck with this story and kept reading as this is honestly oneof the best stories I‚Äôve read this entire year! Petty and her father have lived isolated from the rest ofsociety and live a survivalist lifestyle to the extreme. Petty has been trained by her father rather thanraised as most little girls are. She has been trained to be lethal and efficient and has learned never totrust anyone under any circumstances. He has taught her that the world is a dangerous place and evengoes to the extreme of locking her in her bedroom each and every night under the guise of keeping hersafe. This is the only life Petty has ever known and she has absolutely no idea that her life is far fromnormal. They live on the outskirts of a small town and are known as the town crazies. Everything goesalong fine for Petty until she discovers her father‚Äôs dead body in his bed one night and everything goesoff the rails from that point for her. The police have to be called in to collect her father‚Äôs body and theone friend her father actually had shows up to help Petty take care of the funeral arrangements. He hasulterior motives that are seedy and malicious and I hate him from the second he graces the pages of thisstory. The things he does to Petty are horrible and I found myself truly wishing for bad things to happento this disgusting excuse for a man the entire book!My heart broke over and over for Petty for everything she‚Äôs gone through and I love herstrength and determination to make it through whatever life throws at her. She is a truly inspiringindividual and I found myself wanting something good to finally happen for her. Dekker is a localresident of the small town Petty lived in and he gets pulled into her strange and twisted world and takenon this life changing adventure with her. Petty is going through so many journeys simultaneously andmanages to hold herself together stoically through it all.. She‚Äôs on a mission to find herself, to traceherself back to her roots and to figure out where she fits in this crazy world and I enjoyed every secondof reading about it.

"This book is amazing!  I loved the book from start to finish.  The characters had so much depth to them & the author gives you a peak at each of their history which helps you understand who they really are.  The story begins with a heartbreaking illness Raelyn has been fighting.  She describes the agony she has been going through & what it's cost her.  Loosing her fiance and almost her life has left her brittle & afraid to live everyday as her last.  With the monumental news she receives from her doctor has Raelyn ready to take her life by the reigns & be free of this pain.  She returns back to work once she begins to get herself back to normal.  Raelyn owns an accounting business with her long-term friend from college, Cale.  Upon her return to work Cale proceeds to turn over a client, who is also his friend, to Raelyn to be in charge of managing his finances.  Little is she expecting when she she walks into the meeting is to find a young, hot & smart Damien.  She is thrown for a loop to discover exactly who Damien Heathman is, but even more so when he shows interest in her past his accounting file.  Although during the meeting w/ Damien, Cale joins them & she can feel the tension in the air just not sure as to why.  They're friends right?  At least that's what she believes.  Damien pushes his way into forcing Raelyn to have dinner with him w/ the intention to talk business.  However, it's doesn't take long before Damien tells her something she's not sure how to handle.  Damien proceeds to prove how they both have been betrayed by the same person they thought they knew oh so well, Cale.  Her long time friend & business partner wouldn't do this, would he?  Who does she choose to believe?  Even after the bumpy start Damien & Raelyn find themselves completely drawn to one another which forms a awesome loving relationship.  Everything that happens in between just makes it all the more better.  I was thrilled to find out there is more to their story coming.  I'm impressed with the type of cliffhanger this author left off with.  It had slight closer so you aren't left with you mouth on the floor dying until book 2 releases but yet enough left open that will have you just as excited to get your hands on the next installment.  Needless to say I was very impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZ8BJAGYJ0CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155R57HS#wasThisHelpful","R3DZ8BJAGYJ0CH","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It hurts so good! This is an insanely intense and thoroughly gripping read that I finished in onesitting since I literally could not put it down! This story drop kicks you right into the action and drags youstraight through to the very last page! This is an extremely fast paced story that will leave you reeling formore! This book should come with several warning labels posted right on the cover. First of all, this bookcovers dark subject matter that some may find offensive or too difficult to read about such as sexualabuse and sexual slavery. This is the story of a girl named Eternity who on her eighteenth birthday isabducted by the people who her very own father sold her to and taken forcefully into her new life ofbeing a sex slave. Eternity‚Äôs parents were brutally murdered four years prior and her and her youngersister have been living with their Uncle ever since which should‚Äôve been a safe and loving environmentfor her, but wasn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs been anxiously awaiting her eighteenth birthday so she could take her sisterand flee for a life of happiness and peace. Her dreams are devastatingly crushed when she discoversthat her own father sold her into sexual slavery and that it‚Äôs become time for the buyer to collect. I felt aprofound sense of hopelessness and devastation over Eternity‚Äôs situation and was shocked and confusedas to how any father could ever even think about doing this to their own child. Eternity keeps trying togive him the benefit of the doubt and hoping that there has to be some reason that caused him to bedesperate enough to do something so vile, but I personally don‚Äôt care what the reasoning behind hisaction was and find this offense unforgiveable. She now finds herself in a whole new world where she‚Äôsbeen stripped of everything and is living at the complete mercy of these corrupt men running anunderground sex club called Illicit Angels that caters to the dark and depraved desires of the extremelywealthy. She‚Äôll have to endure whatever they subject her to in order to survive. It was extremely difficultto read about everything that‚Äôs happening to Eternity since her entire situation seems so hopeless andhorrible. I found myself truly admiring her strength and determination and she stays strong and refusesto give up hope when most would have.Eternity finds a protector in the least likely of places while being held captive. The man that isboth man and beast and is feared by all becomes her ally and fierce protector. Justice carries a monsterwithin him that thirsts for the blood of his victims and nothing has been able to calm the beast untilEternity came along. She has a way of being able to bring him out of his most violent rages simply bybeing there and this is surprising to everyone who knows him as the monster and cold blooded killer.Justice is name of the monster and Ryke is the name of the man. Both reside within one body and fightfor control on a daily basis. The trouble is when Justice takes over lots of people die. Both want the girland will do anything and kill anyone who gets in their way. Nobody stands a chance against Justice orRyke and they will both keep Eternity safe, until the two finally decide to battle each other. There‚Äôs notelling who will survive that death match. There‚Äôs just something about both personalities that I findintriguing and I found myself being able to catch glimpses of the good person within whenever he wascaring for Eternity. He seems to have had something horrible happen to him in his past and I am dying toknow each and every one of his secrets. I want to know not only what happened, but more about howsubstantial of a divide there is between the two personalities residing within the man. While he elicitsfear in everyone he comes into contact with I find myself being able to relate to Eternity in the fact that Ido not feel fear towards him at all. Intrigue, puzzlement, wonder, maybe even pity, but not any fear. Ireally hope that we get to see much more of his backstory in the next book in this series. I have read acouple stories involving sexual slavery in the past, but I have never come across a story that included thedissociate personality aspect and I find this adds an entirely new and exciting element of suspense to thestory as a whole. Another strong warning this book should contain is the fact that it ends on one of theworst cliffhangers I‚Äôve ever read! Usually cliffhangers don‚Äôt really bother me all that much, but this oneleft me reeling and screaming ‚ÄúNO‚Äù and wanting to throw my kindle across the room. This ending was soabrupt that it felt as if I was on a great, fast car ride and the car didn‚Äôt even come to a complete stopbefore the door opened and I was tossed out on my butt. This is exactly how the ending of this bookmade me feel and I need more! I highly recommend this book to anyone and I simply cannot wait to findout what happens next! I will be impatiently waiting for the next book in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3223D99K8RQTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VJ2WDC#wasThisHelpful","R3223D99K8RQTJ","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is simply beautiful. I couldn't put it down, I am still suffering from a hangover from staying up till the who knows how long reading.

She is from the wrong side of the tracks. All she is looking for is one-night stands and to finish college. She had a horrible experience when she was in high school, one that left her empty, non-feeling, tarnished and simply guarded. She keeps her feelings in check, never one to let anyone in anymore. She has rules that she follows to keep herself and her heart safe. But when she decides to start to live a normal college life things start to change for her. But with chafe comes trouble. Can she let someone in? Can she make her way back to who she once was? Declan. Declan may be the one to break down her walls and help her. He can see how Elizabeth struggles, even from far away. He can also see a fire burning down deep. Can he make her see what he sees? Can he chase away her fears? Or will she push him away as well?This is a marvelous story. I fell in love with this Brit and his brother!! I believe this could have some spin off story's as well. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YISTA6M85UQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R1YISTA6M85UQ5","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you like a story with some great twists?  Well this story might be for you.It's a story of 2 best friends. Charlotte Brooks & Ella Jane Munro (EJ).  Kinda has the Thelma & Louise feel but a smidgen different.  Yes, it has an old car too.  A Pristine,Loved Green Nova.Charlotte needs EJ's help. She has just killed her abusive husband.  EJ does what any friend would do‚Ä¶calls for help‚Ä¶..Anthony Jacobs.  But this favor will have a price that EJ may not be able to repay. This story starts in Charleston and ends in Las Vegas.But while reading this story, you wonder who the real mouse of the game is.  EJ, Charlotte or Anthony. Gotta read to find out.I only gave 4.5 stars due to I had some trouble in the beginning to really get into the story, it was a little scattered but by the half way point, I was engrossed into the story.  And I loved how the ending was a complete surprise to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9FMRXFF8KQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H4CTYC#wasThisHelpful","R1J9FMRXFF8KQ1","A1KE5LVRU1FYL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KE5LVRU1FYL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My mom was suffering from major knee pain from a fall. She had to quit her daily walks and was on the verge of having surgery on her knee. I bought these for her but she took one and didn't see a change, so she put them in the cupboard and forgot abou them for months. One day she was in severe pain again and she pulled them out and took 2. She took 2 more later on in the day with food. That night she had her first restful sleep in months. She's been taking them ever since and is back to her daily walks and no longer in pain. She swears by these tablets. The Braggs liquid is probably better, but the taste is pretty bad, so this is an easy alternative. I'm constantly recommending these to people now, when they tell me they are in pain. Unfortunately, most people trust doctors more than they trust natural remedies, so they never go out and get them. My mom wouldn't buy them either, so I had to order these for her. I'm so glad I did. If you're having pain in your joints, please give these a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R73PARGU7VNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014DADY#wasThisHelpful","R3R73PARGU7VNP","A2FMN9APIECWO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMN9APIECWO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a good and quick read. I wanted to read it for some time since I read that Michael Jackson wanted to make a movie based on it. Whether or not those rumors were true--who knows. So much of Michael Jackson was fabricated/rumored, especially after his death.  The book is set back in the 50s I believe, but because I work in the Foster Care system, I am interested in these type of stories.

"If this had been hanging at a garage sale for 25 cents, I would not have bought it.  They say you get what you pay for, and no, not in this case.  This is NOT worth $7.98.  I am 5' 5"" tall and weigh 115 lbs.  I ordered a large because of other reviewers saying it ran small.  Well, that was an understatement!I received this in a yellow envelope via US mail.  When I retrieved the package from the mail box my first thought was, ""OH NO, this can't be the top I ordered"".  The envelope was almost flat, with no bulk at all.  Understandably, there is almost no weight to this top.  It is thin, thin, thin!  It runs really small and even the large didn't hang in a free flowing manner.  It clings and looks terrible.

"UPDATE (again) In all fairness to Garmin, I added yet another star.  I sent this watch back because it was almost doubling my steps according to my testing and my pedometer.  However, I think it was just this watch.  I've done so much more research and ALL of these activity trackers can give false positives so that's become a no-brainer for me.I like the Garmin activity trackers/watches so after MUCH research sent for a Garmin Vivoactive.  Just received it yesterday and once again, I am in love.  This one seems to be much more accurate than my last one, however it seems to give some false positives, just the nature of the beast I suppose.  I will leave a review for the Garmin Vivoactive.  Just know, I am so glad I sent this one back and LOVE the Vivoactive!UPDATE:  Well, I've taken two stars off.  Still like this, but not as in love with it now.  I have worked at walking today, in and around the house, on my treadmill, etc.  I was so excited because so far today my Garmin is telling me I have walked 4.49 miles.  Then I realized, and/or noticed something.  I was getting false positives!I am a weaver.  I sit using a rigid heddle loom where I pass the shuttle back and forth.  Not too much of an arm swing, but still some.  And that's when I noticed it and then checked it out quite a few times.  Every time I pass the shuttle back and forth it is counting the arm movement as steps.  So, while I sit and weave the Garmin has probably added a good mile or more.  Just don't know  how many steps it has given me for sitting on my bottom weaving.I was wearing a pedometer before I purchased the Garmin and it was so accurate compared to this.  I am so very disappointed.  How can I tell how much I've walked if it adds steps just because I used my arm?I may return it, not sure.  How can I be proud of something I've done like walk 4 or 5 miles when I know there may be false positives in there and I actually have no idea how long I've walked.  And, I just stood still and swung my arm 20 times and it gave me 37 steps.  How in the world can I tell how far I have walked with this thing doing this??  I am so disappointed!Tomorrow I am going to wear both my Garmin vivofit 2 and my Omron pedometer and see what kind of difference I get.  I'll report back tomorrow with the numbers.If someone can help me with this, I'll add another update and more stars in.-----------------------------------------------------------------------I was afraid of ordering this because, in my opinion, the percentage of 5 star reviews wasn't high enough.  I REALLY wanted the Fitbit like my son has, but my wrist is only 5 3/4"" and I saw a picture a reviewer had posted that showed the Fitbit mechanism really hanging over each side of her wrist.  I wanted the additional functions Fitbit seemed to offer.However, I allowed wisdom dictate which bracelet I should order.  Many of the reviews of this Garmin vivofit2 mentioned how comfortable the watch was to wear and how well it conformed to the wrist.I have never used an activity tracker except for the Omron pedometer (which I really liked) so this is a whole new adventure into the world of technology gadgets.I was worried I wouldn't like the app and that it might not sync for me as some reviewers mentioned.  Well, no problems thus far!  I have it synced to my Note4 and two mac computers.  I don't know any other apps of this kind because as I mentioned, this is my first fitness tracker.  However, I like what I see!  It tracked my sleep patterns nicely last night and I found it interesting, to say the least!  I have already earned two badges for my activities, which is a little plus :)!  And the fact I don't have to worry about a charge is a HUGE plus!!The ease of switching (on the device) to time (which is always showing for me), date, steps walked, steps needed to walk to reach goal, miles walked and calories burned is a big plus!  These are all obtained by simply clicking the little bar on the side of the watch face.  Then, if I want to hold down the bar (pressure maintained rather than quick clicks) I get a number of other features such as backlight, stopwatch, sync, sleep, pair, etc.All in all, I am so glad I got this watch.  Works well for me and REALLY encourages me to get up and walk.  I LOVE the move bar because I find myself stopping or pausing a sedentary activity to get up and walk.I am almost 70 years old, I am 5'5"" tall and only weigh about 114.  I need this watch to keep me young and active!  :)  I do believe it will encourage me to do just that!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA8JR4207GZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY1Z9NQ#wasThisHelpful","RJA8JR4207GZ8","A22F0MDCYWUXF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F0MDCYWUXF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE:  I have been using this for a few days now and wow!!  My buttocks hurt, so my muscles are definitely getting a work out and I can feel it in my core!  I try to do 40 a day with 10 to 15 done at each setting.  Hopefully I can add to that, but even those numbers are definitely talking to my muscles that have been asleep way to long!I really like this bench for many reasons.  The price is great!  It has a small footprint and it's sturdy.  I'm a very small female so I tend to be bony.  I'm almost 70 years old and know that I have to work at trying to strengthen and maintaining strength in areas of my body that want to give out because of age.  One of those areas is the small of the back.  This item definitely works for me with regard to strengthening and stretching those muscles!.At first I was afraid I might do more damage than good if I didn't use this piece of equipment properly so I got on u-tube and found a number of videos that explained the proper and improper way to use this piece of equipment.  Now that I know what to do, I am comfortable with using it.The only thing I found to maybe take a star off on my review is the hardness of the bench seat (for lack of a better term).  Boy oh boy did it hurt the bones of my hips!  But I used a long strip of 6"" foam duct taped to the upper portion where my hip bones hit and then covered that with a towel.  It doesn't look as pretty, but covered with the towel, doesn't look bad and now my hip bones don't hurt.  I didn't take a star off because this really is a good piece of equipment for the price and I'm very pleased with it.It wasn't difficult to put together and the instructions were fairly well written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JQRDX5Z2YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H6XB7W#wasThisHelpful","R11JQRDX5Z2YI","A22F0MDCYWUXF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F0MDCYWUXF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because I have a lot of wood, tile floors with small to large area rugs, the ability to adjust the height is well worth the cost in and of itself.

"after trying the first square.  I thought, NO WAY can people do this square after square after square.  Then I reread the directions and one of the most important (to me) direction I didn't follow.  I wrapped my initial yarn (warp) TIGHT!  I thought this would make a nicer square.  Nope, all it did was make it almost impossible to accomplish the weft, the under, over instructions.  Each row was so tight I struggled and struggled and why I didn't break or at least bend the pins I don't know, but I guess that attests to the strength of these pins.Now, after ""following"" the directions and warping the loom loosely, my 6"" needle accomplishes the weft easily and I've got a coaster set done in the Simply Soft green, yellow, pink and blue done.I am really surprised how much I like doing this and how much I enjoy the end product.  Normally if I crochet or knit a square it's, well a fairly thick square.  These little squares are soft, thin, and delightful.  I really do like this loom and hope others will too.

"I have the 2014 Galaxy Note 4 and have had it in an Otter Box since day 1.  Because it's a big phone, the Otter Box made it so much bigger it was unsightly.  I went to a Verizon store and purchased another case, fairly expensive, but nice looking.  However, because of a problem with this case, it constantly turned down the volume and I would miss calls and texts, so back in the Otter Box it went.Then I found this case on Amazon and thought, what the heck, for that price I'll take a chance.  Wow, am I glad I did.  It's a fairly soft silicone and fits my Galaxy wonderfully, adds a decent amount of padding and all the buttons function as they should.

"I love the Echo who I call Alexa.  Alexa is now a member of the family.  As soon as I enter the living room each morning, cup of coffee in hand, I ask her what the temperature is and she gives me the days forecast.  Alexa gives me the news, she spells words for me and gives me definitions.I use both iHeart radio and Pandora with her and for me that's invaluable.  Not to mention I no longer have to keep in mind what I want to put on my grocery list or run to my list on the refrigerator before I forget, I just tell Alexa to put it on my list for me and she does.  I no longer have to try to remember to do something such as a chore or something I want to fix around the house before winter (or spring, or summer) hits, I just tell Alexa to put it on my to-do list and she does.Alexa does much more than I've mentioned here, but the above is what I use her for the most.My router went out and it took AT&T 6 days before I received a replacement.  I was really surprised ""how"" much I missed Alexa.  I knew I enjoyed her and used her daily, but doing without her was almost as bad as doing without my computer!

"I am so impressed with the stairs. I think I've bought, over the last 20 years,  just about every type of stairs available and also ramps.  I built my own ramps, and my own stairs, trying everything I can to make it comfortable for my dachshunds to climb up and down different heights.Right now I have a little boy dachshund that is afraid of heights and he's terrified of ramps and stairs. He will go up them and down them but it takes a lot out of him. Then I received these stairs and he goes up-and-down them with ease; he is not afraid of them and he is now able to keep up with his two little buddies.When I first ordered them, I thought they were awful expensive, but I now think they are well worth the cost. I will probably  be ordering some more.

"Well, it's a 30+ dollar table. I think I really did get my moneys worth on this, however it looks like a 30+ dollar table.For the negatives:  The shipping box was in tact and not damaged at all yet the screws were loose because the manufactures packing wasn't good. There was one edge where the laminate had come loose but I glued that back and it looks fine.  The dowels are plastic, and some go in too far, and some don't go in the bar enough or go in slightly crooked. So I think the manufacturer needs to read visit their design and just make things fit better.Now for the positives:  it really is a cute little table, and it's quite functional. The little storage drawers hold quite a bit and I'm pleased with that. I love the lower shelf where I can put my galaxy note and even my iPad out of sight and in a position where they don't get damaged by spilled coffee etc.  Upon using other's advice, I used wood glue on the dowels and it seems quite sturdy. The size is great because it sits in front of a small love seat.  I am thinking about using steel wool  on the laminate covering, painting it, and perhaps put on some shabby chic roses on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVUTDJ8UBCOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004350U6M#wasThisHelpful","RPVUTDJ8UBCOD","A22F0MDCYWUXF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F0MDCYWUXF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very high quality thriller, perhaps the best I've read in years.  It's kind of like, if Jo Nesbo decided to make Holden Caulfield the star of a Nelson Demille book.  It has much more depth than is normal for the genre - the character is flawed in a very realistic, deep, complicated way, which is why it felt like a Jo Nesbo does Holden Caulfield.

"Dear Mr. DeMille,I'm an avid fan, and really ok with the fact that you totally phoned this one in (I know you have a young wife and a child, so bills need to be paid.  I get it).  I'm ok that you constantly changed the POV and voice, the lazy writer's trick so favored by James Patterson.  I'm not even convinced that you wrote the non-John Corey parts, and I'm fine with that too.  I'm fine with all of it, because the book was a fun, enjoyable read.  That said, Mr. DeMille, if this style, which borders on novella, is the new normal, then you better pump them out every 9-12 months because I'm not waiting 2 years for another one like this.Sincerely,MePS: With all of my favorite authors switching to Middle East storylines and villains, I had a nostalgic appreciation for the James Bond type Russian storyline in Radiant Angel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OP8IYRW2JFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446580856#wasThisHelpful","R2OP8IYRW2JFT","ANXNTFUW0HKXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANXNTFUW0HKXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying that I own this author's previous 2 books and I use them more than any other cookbooks I own, and I would say she's pretty much my favorite author.  So, when I saw that her newest book was going to be a detox/cleanse book, I was sooooo disappointed.  I'm not into the whole detox/cleanse thing - I eat healthy every day, emphasis on the word ""eat"".  I had no, and I mean zero, interest in a cleanse.  But, prior to the release of Raw & Simple Detox, the author published a few ""sneak peek"" recipes, and the Amazon ""look inside"" feature also allowed me to see more of the book.  From these previews I was able to see that there was indeed food involved!  I made 3 or 4 of the advance recipes and they were really good and satisfying, so I ordered the book, still with some hesitation.Yadda, yadda, yadda - The book is amazing!!!I have been making the recipes and doing a slightly modified version of the lower-sugar ""light"" cleanse for about 2+ weeks, and I must say I feel the best I've felt in a long time.  I've been an ovo-vegetarian since birth (no meat, fish, poultry, or dairy - the only animal products I consume are eggs and bee pollen/honey), so although I eat a healthy diet, I've definitely been a victim of carb-overload.  Despite being an avid runner, as I've aged (44 years), I noticed that my stomach has gotten bigger and my energy has sagged (along with many other things! lol). The recipes in this book, along with the author's general program (green juice in morning, big lunch, light dinner, low glycemic) have really helped me in so many ways!  My stomach is completely flat now!  My energy level has returned.  I sleep like a baby at night.  And, most importantly, my sugar cravings have completely subsided.It was a bit of a struggle at first - the thought of having just soup for dinner scared the hell out of me.  The Fennel Pea soup is very satisfying, and I am stunned that I have not needed more food at night.  The coco greens smoothie for dinner didn't do it for me - just not enough bite to make me feel like I'm eating, so I've been sticking to the chunky soups and that works well (the dilly beet soup is awesome).  They are all delicious and easy, by the way.As far as breakfast - I make big batches of juice 3-4 times per week (basically from whatever is fresh and priced well at supermarket), and keep them in sealed flip top bottles in the fridge.  I add a little MCT oil to my juice, but frankly, it's simply not enough to hold me through a morning workout.  The ""Cacao Chia Silk"" recipe in this book makes an absolutely perfect pre-workout breakfast.  I add a little maca and chaga to the recipe, so it's basically a superfood pudding/coffee replacement.  It's very light in my stomach, yet it holds me until lunch.  When it's really cold (I live in Connecticut), I've been having the berry muesli with hot water (I also add a little psyllium husk to make it a perfect oatmeal replacement).For lunch - I really do feast.  My favorites have been the rustic raw lasagna, the ginger miso rolls (I didn't bother with the rolls, just made them a giant salad), sweet and spicy kelp noodles (served this to lunch guests who loved it!), Romaine fresco tacos (OMG!!!!!).  Her salad dressings are superb, so many times, I just make a giant vegetarian bowl with whatever is in the fridge, and top it with her salad dressings.  The hemp ranch is a must-try, as is the orange tahini.For Treats/Misc - My favorites have been the Adrenal Elixir (you must try this!!!), the chocolate almond bark is possibly the yummiest thing ever, but it's almost too easy to make, and I don't have the will power to have it in the house, so after 2 batches that lasted only about 3-4 days each, I had to stop making it.  The coconut yogurt is orgasmic!!!  Beet kvass is a fantastic and easy alternative to water kefir (which is a total PIA and makes me crave sugar).General Positives - I really like some of the supplement info, I'm finding that the nascent iodine and GTF chromium have really helped me in many ways.  The recipes are easy and delicious.  The plan is flexible - it's really just a guide for your own experimentation to figure out what works best for you.  Shockingly, my endurance as a runner has actually improved by eating this way!  As always, the book is wonderfully designed, well photographed, easy to read, with top-notch food styling.General Negatives - Several typos (the recipe for pickled cabbage is missing the cabbage!), and often the grams to volume conversions are way off, so use common sense and pay attention if you tend to cook with grams.  I pee a lot on this cleanse (I know, TMI, but the foods are mostly diuretics, so be prepared!).  In the beginning I was very cold, but I did calorie counts and I'm certainly getting enough calories, so I think it's my body possibly burning fat for fuel instead of the tons of carbs I usually feed it.  She includes a recipe for salmon so ""protein types"" will have a little something extra, but there's no reasoning as to why eggs aren't also included.  Full disclosure - I've eaten 1-2 local eggs from happy chickens every day on my light version of the cleanse.Overall - I'm just thrilled.  I really continue to love this author's food.  As an FYI - she's one of the only author's with recipes primarily consisting of fruits and vegetables, with nuts/seeds/grains all being accents to the main focus, which is the veggies.  I don't mind at all that she's included cooked things and even fish.  I'm happy that she's more focused on what's healthy, tasty and practical, rather than what is strictly raw or vegan.  I can't wait for her next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34DCSNGU0RWBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592539815#wasThisHelpful","R34DCSNGU0RWBA","ANXNTFUW0HKXZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANXNTFUW0HKXZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this product, and use it all the time.  So much so, that I recently bought a second.  I still sprout beans and grains in glass jars, but the Sproutamo is great for smaller seeds and more traditional sprouts.  The tiny seed insert does have a tendency to come loose if you shake the container too much, but the key is to spin to rinse, don't go up and down.  Centrifugal force is your friend.The very first time I used it, I got mold because I wasn't drying well enough after the rinse.  You really do have to rinse and spin dry twice a day.  I highly recommend watching the YouTube video from the ""SproutPeople"" guy.  It's a short tutorial, and was very helpful to me.

"Yes, I try all the latest and (supposedly) greatest vegan protein powders, but I always come back to Sunwarrior warrior blend.  It's reasonably priced, tastes great (not too stevia filled like Vega), lower calorie, and it has a great protein profile (which is slightly different than many out there, so it's worth rotating this one in from time to time, even if you're stuck on another brand).I also consistently use Vega One and Vega Sport, but I think Sunwarrior tastes better.  At some point, Sunwarrior made a gritty formula, which I didn't like, but the current formula is their best (IMO).

"I am sooooooo glad that I took the plunge and ordered this!  First of all, the toothbrush looks kind of below average, but it's one of the best toothbrushes I've ever used - it is soft, yet really gets into the crevasses of your teeth.  I did some research, and it turns out fewer bristles widely spaced are actually better for cleaning, so the luxe brushes I'm used to, might look nice, but don't clean nearly as well as this simple brush.  That said, I wish the handle was longer.Now, onto the HealThyMouth - OMG best product ever!!  Seriously, after using this at night, I don't even need to brush my teeth in the morning.  I do, of course, but I don't wake up with morning breath at all.  In the morning, I just add a drop of it to my toothpaste and brush as usual.  At night, after brushing, I add a few drops of HealThyMouth to about a quarter cup of water and swish it for about a minute.  The teeth sensitivity has completely disappeared using this.

"I'm really enjoying this cookbook.  It's healthy, the food is on the lighter side (in a good way), and it's not the same old usual boring vegan cookbook combos of tamari, nutritional yeast, nut overload, etc.  Yet, most of the recipes use easily sourced ingredients.  I'm not paleo, so can't comment on it's authenticity as Paleo, but I eat a mostly raw vegan diet, which is paleo-ish.  I have made the green pea falafel numerous times now - it's my new go-to recipe! I've made it in the dehydrator as well as an oven, and it's wonderful both ways (However, I add a little ground flaxseed to bind it). The hemp tabouli is to die for.  I've been making the cauliflower pizza crust to use like pita in other dishes.  I just make a batch of the crust, and shape them into little discs, and they work really well as soft tacos. The ""meatballs"" are also very good.The only negative about this book is that there are a few typos, and references leading to the wrong page.  Also, the recipe for one of the ""french fries"" doesn't include the recipe for the referenced dipping sauce.My final gripe is with the food photography - it is beautiful, but some of the recipes are shot in such a way that they don't seem very hearty for the calorie count.  Why would I want to eat a 400 calorie lettuce cup? Oh wait, hidden beneath the garnish is some sunflower pate...but, it's silly not to emphasize the pate in the picture.

"I love this book.  The recipes are great (although their earthiness probably will not suit everyone).  Love the pizzas and the burgers.  The recipes are extremely caloric and high in fat, so you need to watch it a little if you are eating this type of food alongside standard american diet type food.  If you eat Thrive type foods, your appetite will subside quite a bit, so although the foods are calorically dense, you will not be as hungry.

However, with each new book, the concept has drifted further and further away from the original premise.  This, for me, is the last straw.Most of the recipes call for pre-made supermarket ingredients, and yet the book somehow still manages to be complicated and time consuming!  I'm all for simple and pre-made, but not if I have to go to 3 stores to find the stuff. There is very little creativity here, most of these recipes could be gleaned from various blogs.

"A very thorough introduction to communication structured like a blueprint, examining the very basic building blocks of communication step by step.  The chapters:1.  What is communication2.  How conversations work3.  Seven ways to improve your conversations4.  The skills of enquiry5.  The skills of persuasion6.  Making a presentation7.  Putting it in writing8.  Networking: the new conversationA short appendix of additional reading by chapter.A very worthwhile book which presents communication in a refreshing paradigm that challenges the ""transmission"" model of communication:""Communication begins, not with transmission, but with reception.""and then defines communication as:""The process of creating shared understanding.""The chapters are short, clearly structured and to the point.  I would prefer a few more examples, but this book is more about presenting information in a concise and useful way with very little clutter.  It can be read in a few days, but certainly would be worth coming back to.I found that some of the chapters left me wanting to know more about particular topics, for example, The Ladder of Inference.  I would like a little more practical information on how to use it.  The appendix does, in fact, give a reference for this particular topic, but I would have like some more explanation and examples available of this and several other topics - well, maybe that just means they are really interesting and relevant.  However, some pieces of the blueprint feel grossly underwritten, for example under ""Working out the Relationship"" [Chapter 2] there are four subtopics:  status, power, role and liking, which together define the territory of the conversation.  However ""liking"" is just a few sentences and while it is said that conversations can ""go wrong because we like each other a lot!"" - there isn't any explanation of what this means or how to recognize and avoid it.  Then the author discusses how territory fits in, noting that ""many conversational rules are about asking and giving permission to enter each others territory.  A conversation's success may depend on whether you give or ask clearly for such permission.""  A strong statement unfortunately without one piece of practical advice or example on how to do it.  The topic is is closed at that point.Another thing to mention is that the books seems to be aimed more to the topic of business communication rather than personal, intimate communication (at one point the author rather oddly defines a range of relationship in this way, ""We converse differently with complete strangers than we do with close acquaintances"" rather than friends or intimates, spouse, children, parents).  However, most of the topics and information could be used or adapted to everyday communication with friends and family.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter on enquiry, but didn't find the chapter on making a presentation or networking that useful to my purposes.  Again, more of a business communication approach.Overall I think this is an excellent book.  Concise, but packed with useful information told in a clear and understandable manner.  There are charts, chapter summaries and other graphic devices to enliven the text and make it easier to grasp.  I think it is a very useful addition to the field, an engaging read which would provide most readers with some refreshingly new ideas and perspectives on improving their communication skills.I feel that a few more examples sprinkled throughout the chapters would have been helpful for me.  However, a lot of books are really bloated with examples while the author here chooses a more concise approach which will certainly appeal to many readers.  But, I definitely feel that some of the topics need to be explored in more depth - hence 4 stars, not 5.  Also, I would like to see a chapter on the differences between business and social communication, or one that touches on the subtle complexities of social and intimate communication.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8N6MYYRPG0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749467169#wasThisHelpful","RR8N6MYYRPG0E","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gets off to an interesting start - two seemingly unrelated events unfold.  The the character intro - not unlike the previous book with this character that I read (I find the Olivia/partner character useless), but OK, no problem.  Some of the writing is a bit hackneyed - the character blurb of thought written as a paragraph after characters are introduced, the character supposedly thinking all of this as he or she gets out of the car and goes into the convenience store or whatever.  Not really believable, seemingly second-rate craft.  A certain amount of description doesn't do much in terms of setting mood or moving the plot along, and gets skipped as I read along.  BUT, believable characters, some very good dialogue and a pretty interesting plot.  HOWEVER along comes page 142 and that is just not believable, one of the characters figures the whole set up out, pretty much out of his own head down in the cellar.  I don't buy it.  Moving along, however, the plot once again becomes unbelievable as Maitland turns into a total dunce and winds up walking into an ambush set up a totally unbelievable and unreliable tweeker.  This is not the author's best work, but shows a lot of promise.  I have found his later books to be a bit more believable overall and better written, but this is still engaging, if a bit clunky, here and there.  The ending, however was very well done and very engaging - definitely worth finishing the book.  Overall it felt a bit like Yojimbo in Kansas - and that's a good thing :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375UEYOGPRDKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594144400#wasThisHelpful","R375UEYOGPRDKP","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A few plot details aren't fully convincing - for example, really, he didn't throw away the gun?  That is pretty implausible to me.

The foam thing probably works OK, it isn't anything special.  The problem I have with this heating pad is that the controller doesn't have solid feeling stops or clicks.  So in between low and off there is a sort of half click that doesn't start any heat.  Then it is another kind of soft half click and then another click to get to medium.  This is too much trouble - it is too ""fiddly"" if you understand what I mean.  I will most likely use this on an almost daily basis for years - way too much fiddling with the controller to get it where I want it.

"This was a lot of fun - the ping-pong playing detective is good company.  I enjoyed the location (not far from home) which brought veracity to the story.  A bit convenient the way the detective always seems to know someone who can get him the information he needs though.  Also, bottom line, the plot doesn't really hold up.  The scene at the top of the hiking trail doesn't make sense (spoiler alert) why would the two goons let themselves get beat up pretty badly when one of them has a gun?  No, doesn't make sense.  The gun then plays into the final scene's explanation for the way the crimes were committed - but the explanation is really tough to buy and I didn't buy it.

"Sad as it may be that Mr. Gage is no longer with us, I still must say that this book is largely a by the numbers Mario Silva book with essentially the same themes as his other books and the same weaknesses.  The corrupt priest, the greedy landowners, local police on the take, all same-same.  I had to check the publication date a couple of times because I thought maybe I had read this already.  I think there is possibly a fine story to be written about these themes - related to Amazonas, Indian tribes, settlers, social conflict, land use policy, economic progress vs. ecological devastation, etc., but unfortunately, as it reads here, it is very predictable and banal.  The characters are simply caricatures without psychological depth.  There are a couple of good scenes (re the boy and the battered wife) but most of it is mediocre.  The last 20 pages ""tell"" everything, all the goings on that led to the crimes being investigated, but it is hard to really care about the overly complicated soap opera-ish shenanigans unloaded upon the reader in this way - the ludicrous motivations are almost disrespectful to the book's themes.  The characters are largely 2-dimensional contrivances for the author's agenda about the endemic social evils in Brazil.  His cause is an important one, but this book doesn't do it justice - nor is it very entertaining as a mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HY8OB9V0PXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616952725#wasThisHelpful","R16HY8OB9V0PXG","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first it seemed kind of clever and charming, but the convoluted plot, filled with all kinds of absurd tangents, grew stale and tiresome for me.  The characters, initially kind of amusing, become annoying and silly - and then stupid and inane.  The story just becomes more and more ridiculous.  I need a certain amount of basic believability - character truth - to care enough to want to read a book, particularly one as convoluted as this.  One example would be that I simply cannot understand why Effie is with Oliver.  There doesn't seem to be any real chemistry between them, no camaraderie/connection or - despite the mention of passion - no physical fireworks either.  Many other things fall flat too.

"This is the third book in the series that I am reading.  I read the most recent one first (from the libraries new book shelf) and enjoyed it quite a bit.  So, I then went back to read the first one, which I also found quite fun.  It was quite a bit shorter and more of a short story than a full fledged novel, but that was fine.  Well, this, the second installment in the series is perhaps the result of too much praise over the first novel.  Over long by a good 50-75 pages.  I understand that the books are themed by the seasons, but three pages at a time of spring descriptions... by far too much.  The writer is not so gifted to keep my interest.  I also find the pages of Ricciardi swooning idiotically over Erica's dish washing and needlepoint to be tedious beyond belief.  Hard to believe he is such a fine detective but otherwise a complete social idiot.  Strains credulity, really.  Also, although this is actually the second book in the series, whereas I have read three and have more knowledge about the authors scope, I find the lack of supporting characters overly narrow.  Ricciardi's superior is a cliche.  There are no other police officers of significance besides Maione, who I enjoy, a sort of Sancho Panza/Obelisk figure. Tata Rosa is a stereotype.  I didn't like the kaleidoscopic beginning, finding it confusing and too diffuse.  So, finally, I can't finish the book.  Just too much to skip.  It hasn't held my interest.It is a sophomore slump kind of book, inadequately edited,loose and bloated.  Too much hot air description - opening the book at random - ""Ricciardi imagined that genuine love, the kind of love that didn't pollute the soul, could easily become the driving force of one's life.  As he watched that family, he intuitively understood their feelings for each other.  A distracted caress, a smile, an affectionate hair-tousling.  Gestures that were normal and, at the same time, extraordinary.  In short, a family.""  And it goes on and on, blah, blah, blah.  The author doesn't realize that what he is saying isn't all that profound or difficult to grasp and so he says it over and over, thinking that it is so deep and fascinating but I, for one, cannot stand to wade through it anymore.I believe there might be a good mystery here with an interesting detective, but like a before and after picture for a weight loss product, it can only be found after shedding 75 pages of fat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SL051YETPMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609451139#wasThisHelpful","R22SL051YETPMN","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with others.  These refills are garbage.  I just changed one because the cartridge in my pen was writing in a fairly dry, scratchy way, with a very thin line or no line at all.  I figured it must be running out of ink.  OK, no problem.  Put a new one in, right out of the package, and it is the same!!  Not smooth, not bold, not rich - none of those.  Scratchy, skipping and thin.  And it is too late to return it.

"Right now I am doing a head to head ;) comparison with Etymotic Research (ER) HF5.  The Etymotic Research HF5 were way better than the Bose IE2 (they aren't even in the same class as either - despite the 1000's of over the moon reviews for the Bose) and they were better than Shure SE215-K.  The Bose were out of the running right away - flabby sound, ""rounded"" (lack of) detail.  Bad.  The Shure I liked, they were comfortable and sounded good, but the ER HF5 were definitely more detailed, although a bit less bass, the sound was more detailed and nuanced, by a significant amount.  After 20 or 30 minutes it was clear to me that the ER was the best of the three, nuanced, detailed, musical.  As many will say, they are not the most comfortable to wear, but I got the hang of wearing them and found that I enjoyed listening to them.  After a few hours (on an airplane) I found my ears were just a bit sore.  I just used the earpieces that they came fitted with - there are other choices, which might have been more comfortable, but, for the most part, I was OK with the ones that they came with.  I figured I would change them at another time.  And so, I thought I was set.  HOWEVER, I read about a product that I had not heard of - the RHA MA750i - a glowing review in an audiophile publication.  So I ordered a pair to compare.  Now, I am, more or less, an audiophile - yes, I have spent thousands of dollars on power cables, interconnects and speaker cables.  I do realize that listening from my smartphone isn't the same - the source isn't as clean - so I had reasonable expectations for what ear buds might do.  However, that being said, I do believe that I know how to judge sound - detail, timbre, tonality, sound staging and that most ephemeral - musicality.  Is it involving?  That being said, I put on the RHA using a CD source.  They immediately sounded great.  Very warm, melodic, beautiful tones, rounded, detailed.  I could hear the drum skin slap in a precise and defined way.  Compared to the EM (which were pretty well broken in at this point), they are more involving, more bass, warmer overall, and yet, as many ""warm"" sounding speakers can get muddy, I was careful to listen for detail and it certainly is there - harmonies, cymbal work, etc.  It was all there with a bigger ""sound stage"" than the EM have.  The RHA are a bit more sensitive, so I was careful to turn them down a bit after listening to the EM.The EM are very good, very ""flat"" sounding, with space around the instruments, but they lack warmth and they don't image as well as the RHA, they aren't as detailed, particularly in the treble (cymbals), they definitely have less bass.  Also, bottom line, the RHA are super comfortable, so no issue with that!  And they are made better, more solid, thicker wires - and they have a longer warranty.  Overall the RHA are warmer and more involving, with more bass and easy to wear.  The EM are fussy with placement.  They can easily get pushed or pulled out of the perfect alignment they require to sound good.  To me, there is no doubt that the RHA MA750i are the best of those I listened to.  I don't think you would absolutely regret buying the EM but I suspect the vast majority of people would prefer the RHA.  And, just to get ahead of this - I listened to pop, classical and jazz on all the ear buds.A few extra thoughts.  If you can't, or don't want, to spend this much money on ear buds, I have listened to a few pair in a lower price category.  Although I did not do an exhaustive listening, I can easily recommend the Beyerdynamic MMX 101 - you should listen to them before you settle on a purchase under ~$90 - they are ~ $63 and don't compare to the RHA, but are solid and balanced in every respect, music wise.The more I listen to the RHAMA750i the more I like them.  Once they are broken in, I can only expect them to sound better, but right out of the box, they are 5/5 sound wise, 5/5 build quality, 5/5 comfort, 5/5 warranty.  10/5 value.

"This novel took quite a bit of time introducing us to the 5 main characters.  There is also a lot of back story, time shifting and paragraphs of locale description (which added almost nothing to the novel for me) - altogether these 3 slow the narrative down quite a bit.  But, it does get started and gets more interesting.  However, after 400 pages I felt quite cheated.  The writer lacks courage and/or inventiveness.  This book would have been much, much more interesting - and valuable - if the narrative arc moved not only more quickly but also if the writer had moved his characters through more interesting and psychologically complex challenges so that the reader could really know them more deeply.  Instead, the seemingly intertwining characters (vague spoiler here) don't really meet, they bounce off of each other.  If the author was intending to portray social isolation, he did that well, but that simply doesn't make for a very interesting character driven novel.  Although it can be quite dreary, sad and even dull, at times the book is quite interesting and, even a bit fun/clever, but over all I felt that the author didn't know where to go with these characters, hence despite a fair bit of plot, they don't really grow and change very much over the course of the novel.  The novel plods and the characters seem stuck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJIJXJR5N8VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994345#wasThisHelpful","R2FJIJXJR5N8VX","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Number one, this really isn't a very bright light!  I have a lamp with a 150w traditional bulb (full spectrum) right near where I placed this light and the TaoTronics isn't nearly as bright, except for a very small area just below - and close to - the lamp.  Even then, it just isn't that bright.  The color is also fairly cold.  Not nearly as adjustable as implied.  It isn't warm by any stretch of the imagination.  Two, it is small and doesn't reach very far physically.  I had it placed on a lamp table beside my couch.  Sitting all the way at the end of the couch, near the table, I could not adjust the lamp so that it easily illuminated the book I was reading.  It just doesn't have the reach.  I think this lamp is only really useful if you use it as a desk lamp, placing it just to the side of whatever you are reading.  Other - it was easy to put together and easy to use.  I didn't like that it has a light illuminating the on/off switch at all times, nor did I like the way the cord sticks out of the back, several inches above the base.  Not very stylish, although the overall finish of the plastic is fine (mine was black).On a customer service note, the seller called me (not sure how they got my cell number) to ask about my satisfaction with the lamp (in January 2015), and I told them I returned it, and why.  They sent me a $15 gift certificate to Amazon for my trouble (returning the item) which I thought was very nice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF9X1ZT23K15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APAQSP6#wasThisHelpful","R3JF9X1ZT23K15","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A fine mystery story that is as much a psychological portrait of a flawed but deeply human character and a portrait of a country, Italy, at a time of great changes, conflict and challenges, both internal and external.  One of the things I have particularly enjoyed is the length of the book in terms of pages and in terms of the time span it covers, although I thought it could have been a little bit shorter, the writing a bit tighter.  Nevertheless, there is time and space to explore the questions of evil, redemption, loyalty and personal responsibility which the author handled very well.  I have enjoyed this book immensely and look forward to more by this author!My only criticism is the very poor proofreading - the text is filled with errors, fractured sentences, which at times are confusing in terms of meaning and not simply distractions.  Occasionally it seems like they might be translation errors, but most of the time it seems to be simply a lack of effective proof reading.  Hopefully these will be cleaned up in future editions.A lengthy work, ambitious in scope and well worth the effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3093OV626X0RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162365002X#wasThisHelpful","R3093OV626X0RL","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry, I know everyone else raves about it, so I will write what may be an unpopular review.  No one can take away from Jurek's athletic accomplishments.  I certainly won't.  However, this is an insipid mash of pop - often Eastern - psychology and a few nothing special recipes.  My gosh, what a joke.  Yes, they're all here... ""satori"", ""Zen"", ""bushido""... Thoreau, Andrew Weill (who writes yet another back cover blurb), Ekhart Tolle, Leonard Cohen, even Noam Chomsky...  Check, check, check.  Blah, blah, blah.  Nothing deep though, just the right (buzz) words for the times, apparently.If you are really interested in the spirituality he glosses over, then there are dozens of books that will open up your mind and heart much, much more deeply.If you are interested in veganism, then purchase ""Veganomicon"" which has very, very useful advice and hundreds and hundreds of recipes.No doubt he is great at running long, long distances - mile after mile after mile -  but this book doesn't hold my interest for a yard.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FV5FO4L4YPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544002318#wasThisHelpful","R34FV5FO4L4YPT","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Sadelite, by Northern Light Technologies and I've had it for years.  It was expensive, but I have never had any problem with it, have never even had to replace the bulbs.  It work great.  It is built like a tank.  It is not portable - nor is is supposed to be.  I wanted a light to bring with me when I travel, frequently working night shifts.  I bought the Lightphoria based on reviews.  At first I was surprised by how little it is, but I thought, great, it will be easy to travel with, and it is.  When I first turned it on, I was a little thrown by the LEDs, the way the light is not contiguous (the Sadelite uses fluorescent tubes) and creates some afterimage and color ghosting in my field of vision.  But, I quickly got used to this.  It is very bright and it does what it is supposed to do.  BUT, it is cheap plastic.  The stand doesn't even adjust so you have to be sure it is on a surface that is the right height because you cannot adjust the angle of the light.  I have not dropped the light, nor would I expect it to endure any shock at all.  As I said, it is cheap plastic.  I think it is way over-priced for what it actually is.That being said, it does work.  But, if I could find a similar product that was cheaper I would buy it, because there isn't anything special about this one other than the fact that it does function.  It seems the market is filled with light products all selling at what must be a very, very hefty mark-up.So, unless portability is key for you, I would suggest buying a light that is a bit more convenient to use and is likely to last longer or survive a spill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQ9U6M7JG778/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JF3G08#wasThisHelpful","R2RQ9U6M7JG778","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If the lock screen feature included the ability to go back to a designated place (by time) that would be great, but no, it doesn't.

"My first of the series.  I found the characters very interesting, unusual and good company.  I was really charmed at the opening little mystery and the way it was solved, like an amuse bouche.  So, I had high hopes for this book.  However, ultimately, the main story fell flat.  I didn't feel that I was able to watch the detective solve the mystery.  There weren't any real ""clues"" - we were told things only, i.e. regarding sugar packets, hair length and similar looking suits, quite late in the game.  The mystery then (slight spoiler) is ""solved"" in a most ridiculous and totally unconvincing way, although everyone buys it - only for the final revelation of who really did it.  However, that was also really quite unconvincing - more a pastiche of psychologizing on the part of the inspector than any real hard evidence.  Which can be OK, if the character is drawn is such a way as to make the psychology clear, but I didn't feel that was the case here.  We are told a bunch of things about the character's life (failures, etc.) that we had no way of knowing, and these are knitted together to explain the character's crimes in the last pages of the book.  Very far fetched and simply told, in the end.Despite what some reviewers say, this is not a police procedural at all, although the pacing is similar.  There is almost no methodical investigation, forensics or strategized, clever interviews.I also felt that the book was about 20 pages too long.  Not only was the mystery rather a dud, but the pacing sagged noticeably.If you want interesting characters and a mystery which can be, and is, methodically investigated and solved in a believable manner, then read the Martin Beck series.  However, I will read another book in this series because I did very much enjoy the unconventional characters and the lack of graphic violence, as well as the author's lyrical, charming, witty and mature writing style.  Bravo to the translator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKSL0VP3QBMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123122#wasThisHelpful","R2PKSL0VP3QBMP","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the watch works, it is fine.  BUT and that is a big, BIG but - it usually (4 out of 5 times) takes at least 3 minutes or more to find the satellites, while outdoors.  This is just ridiculous.  To me, one minute or less would be acceptable.  I run because I like to run - one of the reasons I like to run is that I get dressed, strap on my Asics and out the door - instant exercise, no time driving to gym, parking, etc.  BUT - NO - finding the satellites takes 3 minutes, so I AM STANDING OUTSIDE OF MY DOOR, ON THE SIDEWALK, WAITING FOR THE STUPID WATCH TO FIND THE SATELLITES.  That is about 1/4 mile or so at my humble pace of 9 minutes/mile.  I DON'T WANT TO STAND THERE!!

"and in the right authorial hands this might indeed be a ""savagely funny"" ""stylishly-executed romp.""  Instead it is a terribly boring, fragmented story with virtually no narrative arc - merely vignettes of nasty violence strung together.  It is savage, not funny.  There are paragraphs and pages of boring description, so I cannot say that it is ""stylishly-executed"" either.  It is also fairly ridiculous and totally unbelievable even at the times when it isn't over the top violent.  For example, there is no way a 5 yer-old child would know that there is an opera called ""Boris Godunov"" - so there is no way he could get the pun ""Good enough""!!

"I'm at chapter 43 and the book is starting to fall apart for me, which is a pity because I've been enjoying it.  I like a good legal thriller, some of the dialogue has been very compelling, both in the courtroom and between Jason and Alexa, their initial meeting.  But, the way Jason holds everything to himself, we are supposed to believe, because of his - obviously tenuous - code of legal ethics and his keep it all to himself, never admit failure or fear ""guy"" personality/back story.  It really doesn't hold up for me.  This is the same character who was supposed to be mature and stable enough - with enough insight - to have had a happy marriage, to be a husband and father, and a successful attorney.  Now we are supposed to believe he makes these incredibly poor, poor go-it-alone choices, which are at the heart of the story.  Sorry, hard to buy this, Oxycontin or not.  Maybe it will get better - I'll give it a few more chapters, and edit this review if it improves.  If not, back to the library with it!So, I've just finished and I have to say that it does improve - my initial review gave it two stars, but the story becomes ever more convoluted and unbelievable.  There are a few things that Jason could have done to help himself, much sooner, in terms of establishing his innocence.  So the ending, although it is kind of fun, is also rather contrived and relies on the reader suspending disbelief a little too much.  I don't want to give away the details in case you want to read it, but, it is just mediocre, overall.  Several other reviewers have made good points in regard to the weaknesses here.  I actually think the story could have been improved by avoiding such a convoluted structure, the 2-person narrative and some other aspects.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368KQC132PDWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158804#wasThisHelpful","R368KQC132PDWO","A22RXNCWIC1OCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RXNCWIC1OCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Patrick Modiano, as you may recall, was the most recent Nobel Prize winner (2014), though what that means, if anything, is hard to say.  It is difficult for me to go into a book whose author is a Nobel winner without half-formed, amorphous ideas about what kind of quality that should represent--for myself (even though I shouldn't), I can't help but think of the Nobel as the acme of awards, and therefore have expectations about any particular example of the author's work that are unrealistic.  Basically, I'm expecting to have my socks knocked off--though I doubt I can even describe what that kind of book would look like.MISSING PERSON is good--I liked it, though my socks were still snuggled against my feet when I was through.  However, it is one of those persnickety books--once finished, it hangs around like dream fragments in the morning.  Probably the two highest compliments that I can pay it is that I would like to read some more of Mr. Modiano, and that at some point, I'd like to read MISSING PERSON again.  Although the two books share no details in common except the nationality of their authors and a certain tone, I'm reminded of another recent Nobel winner, J.M.G. Le Clezio, whose The Prospector also had a dreamy feel to it.  Though 'unresolved' may be an accurate way to describe them both, neither felt incomplete, though readers who dislike loose ends might be disappointed.MISSING PERSON is the story of a man whose quest to regain the memory of his past takes him from one end of Paris to the other, teasing out connections and associations, slowly building a picture of his time in occupied France.  Eventually, from the evidence he uncovers, and bits of his own memories that return, a semblance of a narrative appears, but it is far from complete by the book's end--nagging questions remain.It seems no great stretch to think that MISSING PERSON, originally written in 1978, could have been Mr. Modiano's attempt at an allegory for France itself--that the country suffered from amnesia when it came to Vichy France.  Whether or not it is an effective allegory, I can't say, not being familiar with the attitudes and mindset of the French people at ANY time, let alone the mid-1970's.  I CAN say that it is an affecting story regardless of any societal implications--if it is a representation of French attitudes, it is also an individual story.  Haunting may be too strong; perhaps moody and atmospheric are better, and the sense of aloneness which permeates the amnesiac also points to the ephemeral nature of all our memories.In the end, I found MISSING PERSON to be a welcome change from the satirical trend in most contemporary novels (if 1978 is still contemporary).  It was as if the author is saying that there are still some things we don't know about ourselves, and I found that refreshing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBIACKYDBM9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567922813#wasThisHelpful","RUBIACKYDBM9O","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second work I've read of Andric, the first being one of his more prominent novels, THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA.  Both of these works are very similar, as the novel THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA was a collection of stories centered on the community on the Drina river, and THE DAMNED YARD a collection of stories which centered on Bosnia during the rule of the Ottoman Turks.  One could say that the novel had more of a central theme to keep it together, though in essence, there seemed little that would have prevented Andric from fitting in the stories from THE DAMNED YARD into THE DRINA.I don't know if I have the ability to communicate exactly what it was that I found so entrancing about Andric's stories--they are deceptively simple; just folk stories really.  And yet somehow the author was able to draw me into this world of which I have no first-hand knowledge (and little second-hand), and make it fascinating.  One thought that struck a glancing blow as I was reading was how real these people seemed--real without the artificial, satirical layers that the contemporary world imposes on us.  I feel sometimes that what we think we know about human nature has progressed to where we are no longer able to appreciate its intricacies, and the characters that populate Andric's stories are unburdened by psychology and other inhibiting information.  Therefore they can, at times, appear child-like, yet at the same time freer.Well, as I say--it's not a simple thing to describe why these stories have their appeal.  Other readers may find them unsophisticated--and they are; wonderfully so.  And also deeply affecting.  Andric writes about another way to live life, a way that I feel most of the people I know would rebuff.  But in Andric's hands, it can seem liberating.I look forward to reading more by Andric--it has been a singular pleasure for me to read what I have so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQ1PEWNKUQ6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1856100227#wasThisHelpful","R1EQ1PEWNKUQ6R","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Anchor books (A 120) edition with the Edward Gorey cover illustration, copyrighted 1957 with a Library of Congress catalog number of 57-11419 contains six stories, all translated by David Magarshack:THE TERRIBLE VENGEANCEIVAN FYDOROVICH SHPONKA AND HIS AUNTTHE PORTRAITNEVSKY AVENUETHE NOSETHE OVERCOATUsing the look inside feature here on Amazon, I can see this is the exact list of stories for the in-print edition of The Overcoat and Other Tales of Good and Evil, with the same translator and the same introduction.  Those readers who may also be considering the Penguin edition of The Diary of a Madman, The Government Inspector, and Selected Stories will find an overlap of four stories and four that are different.  Kindle readers might be interested in Delphi Complete Works of Nikolai Gogol whereas book readers might prefer either The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol or even The Complete Tales of Nikolai Gogol (Volume 1) and Vol. 2.As for these particular stories themselves, the word delightful springs to mind.  There is a certain charm to them, though they are not 'happy' stories--in fact, several are actually tragic.  But what I did find surprising and engaging was the manner in which Gogol told the stories.  It hit me as I was reading (and wondering what the draw was) that contemporary short-stories--especially American short-stories--have a sameness to them that makes any impact they have ephemeral; the seem to spring from the same mill, and frankly, I often find them frustrating.A word about short-stories for a moment--I've been on a short-story binge lately, reading several single-author collections at once, going from volume to volume in a sort of round-robin, and it's been an eye-opening experience.  I've come to believe that short-stories are more like poetry than novels, designed to evoke a certain facet of human nature rather than to (perhaps) lead us into insights as a novel might do.  Regardless, Gogol's stories do, I think, evoke that same feeling, yet he does so in a flamboyant, grand style, whereas most 'literary' short-stories I come across nowadays seem to be trying to avoid that kind of exuberance, preferring to rely on subtlety and nuance.  I don't think either way is incorrect--but as for something I wasn't used to, Gogol's stories had all the more force for being unusual.I had read THE OVERCOAT some time before--at that time, I was less than impressed.  I thought too much had been made about the story over time by critics and other writers.  I've become more favorable to it now--THE OVERCOAT gets much of its acclaim for being one of the first stories that took a common man and made him the 'hero' of the tale.  I don't think anyone thought a low-level clerk could even HAVE a story worth telling, and the inspiration it engendered makes Dostoevski's quote ""We all came out of Gogol's overcoat"" make sense, even if the story itself--at first glance--may not seem all that inspiring.At any rate, it perhaps true that I read this collection at a time when it would have the most affect on me--as I said, I thought it was absolutely delightful.  Whether others will feel the same way will depend largely on how open they are to the different style of the stories, as opposed to those in a more contemporary vein.  I think that for those who have become discouraged by modern short-stories, Gogol might be a welcome change as well, though I have found for me, that no matter whose stories I'm reading, they resonate much more deeply if I don't read them one after the other, and read something else in-between.I doubt much more needs to be said about Gogol, or the impact of his stories.  Plenty of other writers have said anything that needs to be said much better than I can--I simply would say that I agree.  They are entirely worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37V3KWET7WGEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VVVJW8#wasThisHelpful","R37V3KWET7WGEQ","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**This review is for the audio version narrated by George Guidell and produced by Recorded Books**There's probably been enough ink spilled over time concerning Frank Herbert, DUNE, its sequels, and the decision by Brian Herbert to continue the franchise to contribute much more.  I'd say enough ink has been spilled just in writing the series itself--no doubt, DUNE alone is a long book.  And that is precisely why, when I happened to run across this audio version at a library discard sale, I splurged and gave up the five clams for it--I have to make long trips in the car every month, and audiobooks the length of novels such as DUNE have been life-savers.As I said, there's not much benefit in writing about DUNE itself--it's pretty well covered, here at Amazon as well as other places.  The purpose of my review is to extoll the pleasure it was to listen to the narrator, George Guidell, as he took on this massive project.  Since listening to DUNE, I've discovered that, as far as audiobook narrators go, Mr. Guidell is a sort of superstar, a reputation I'd say is richly deserved.  The tone and resonance of a narrator's voice can make or break a book for me, and Mr. Guidell's is one of the best I've heard (Richard Mathews is the only one that tops him).I had avoided reading DUNE for many years--I think I had in my mind that it would be entertaining, though on a fairly superficial level.  I had also read another book by Herbert many years previously, and I was unimpressed, which also affected my decision.  I was glad that the audio version took the effort out of it, and I can say now that, as a listener (which I think is subtly different that as a reader), I enjoyed the story of Paul Atreides quite a bit, though it wasn't as though I thought the book had no flaws--some of the final scenes especially in the book feel anticlimactic, or at least not maximized after the incredible build-up. But whether it was these or any other flaws that I noticed, they all seemed swept away by the marvelous scope and epic sweep of the book.  Vastly entertaining, I look forward to reading the sequel, and most probably, the rest of the series.A Soapbox note--Amazon, for whatever reason, has always combined all the reviews for different editions on the same product page, so that no matter what product page you start with, when you look at the reviews, you'll see reviews for all editions, including the audio versions.  If you are wondering why an audio review is mixed in with the print version reviews, this is why--at the head of each review is a link that will take you to the product page that that review originated from.  I think this is an unnecessary hurdle, but the powers-that-be seem to be okay with it, because even after it's been brought to their attention, it is still done the same way.  If you are also frustrated by this process, I'd encourage you to email Amazon and suggest it be changed.  Stepping down off the soapbox now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V31QFJ3SQJ87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402553242#wasThisHelpful","R1V31QFJ3SQJ87","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering THE COCKATOOS, by the Australian Nobel Laureate Patrick White, I find it nearly impossible to arrive at an assessment--here are six long stories, written in a similar style which I can recognize as the work of a master craftsman, yet which also had nearly no affect on me.  Each of these stories seem to be trying to illustrate the same bleak worldview by shaving the lives of its protagonists into incredibly fine cross-sections, then illuminating them one facet, one nuance at a time; the effect is dense, finely articulated, and designed for maximum exposure of the interior lives of these people.  Yet what the author reveals with these portraits is a world of little joy, of loss and repressed longing, of suppressed rage, and of quiet, confused desperation.It's also true that at time, the stories are SO nuanced that I'm not sure if I caught all the details--for sure there is repressed sexuality in some, repressed memories of molestation in others, and few characters who have any idea (as it should be) as to why they do the things that they do.  Often they seem compelled by forces within them, forces that were forged in the past and have emerged recently because of some new trauma, or even because of some small trigger that unleashes the pent-up emotions of a lifetime.Whereas Patrick White is more than proficient at bringing these states about in his characters, the bleakness can be a bit unrelenting.  These people all live in a state of consciousness that would be unbearable, I'd think, and though I'm sure there are people who manage to do so, the stories in THE COCKATOOS seem to imply that this is the natural way of things.  In this he shares somewhat a similarity with another Nobel Laureate, Alice Munro, whose stories, I think, also seem heavily weighted toward alienation and aloneness.Perhaps it would have made a difference if I'd been able to put more space between reading each story; I pulled THE COCKATOOS down with eleven other single author collections, and read out of each using the round-robin method.  It may be that I needed even more time between stories; that may have diminished some of the bleakness I felt overall, and allowed me to appreciate each story without the weight of the preceding one bearing it down.  In any case, it does not put me off reading more of Patrick White, as he is a master craftsman, there is no doubt.  And it may be that at another time I'd be more receptive to the feelings he tried to evoke--but I hope not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36M87DT540L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670226483#wasThisHelpful","R36M87DT540L3","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the back cover of my edition an unknown copywriter states that A FINE BALANCE has 'a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall(s) the work of Charles Dickens.'  Dickens is not the first writer that would have popped into my mind when thinking of Rohinton Mistry's novel, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad comparison--in fact, no matter what your opinion is of the author of OLIVER TWIST, I can see how your assessment of A FINE BALANCE might easily coincide with it.To my mind, Dickens' greatest strength was, above all, telling a compelling story, and, secondary, doing so in a way that strongly emphasized the attitudes and customs of time and place.  These are the aspects that I think of most when I think of A FINE BALANCE.  On the flip side, I also thought that Dickens' characters, no matter how eccentric, were always a little too black or white, even if some showed a bit of nuance toward the end.  This, I think, is a failing of Mr Mistry's as well; and, in fact, is probably what separates A FINE BALANCE--a well-told, enjoyable tale--from a modern day classic.The idea behind the novel seems to be to illustrate a certain time in India (1975) by using several different characters who represent the types of 'common-man' in Indian society; the plot then consists of these different types bouncing off of one another as they strive to get ahead using the limited opportunities available to them in the culture and the political situation of the time.  The back-story of these characters is fraught with hair-raising situations, and a great frustration on the part of this reader that anyone, anywhere should ever have had to go through these blatantly unfair practices.  And make no mistake--I fully believe that the situations as Mr. Mistry describes are realistic, and truthful in their way.  In fact, he may not even have gone far enough in describing the institutionalized unfairness that the lower-classes and women had to experience in the prevailing culture.Still, I can't help feeling there is a bit of contrivance on the part of the author to raise my anger and frustration level to a fever pitch in order to fully sway my sympathy toward these characters.  Added to their back-story then is a description of their likable personalities--they are certainly flawed, the author does not make them saints, but their failings are easily overlooked, especially as they now have my sympathy.  Whether or not the author is trying to convey any overt message by this--such as we might not ought to judge anyone unless we know where they come from--I don't know, though there is an undertone suggesting it.  While I think that is a legitimate point to bring out, sometimes artists have a way of manipulating the story in order to sway opinion, and intentional or no, it does feel as though the writing in A FINE BALANCE has a design to it.Does that make it a failure, or not worthwhile?  Of course not--I found the book entertaining, even though I thought its faults were apparent; and I also learned some about the recent history of India that was unfamiliar to me.  Readers who have no idea of the pressures that India has gone through in the last fifty years, or who are completely unacquainted with the broader political problems it has faced may find some of the references to be confusing, though one doesn't have to be a student of India to muddle through most of the allusions.  I would say my knowledge of this time and place is just fair, and I didn't have too much trouble.I have no doubt that the title of A FINE BALANCE refers to the razor-thin margin for error that the Indian populace has for co-existing--both in 1975 and in today's world as well, I'm sure.  To make a country so full of contradictions function day to day takes an amount of coordination that is frankly unbelievable, and Mr. Mistry succeeds in bringing that out as well, and, despite the few objections I have, the combination of an entertaining story and a depiction of India as it is, is certainly worth a look.  Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZZ7CKDMSI9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140003065X#wasThisHelpful","RGZZ7CKDMSI9N","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wasn't aware of Diana Trilling's contribution to criticism--at least, not beyond the fact that she was the wife of Lionel Trilling, a name much more familiar to me.  When a friend suggested REVIEWING THE FORTIES, I was automatically interested--it fit several of my interests; literature from the forties, and criticism, to name only two.  I can't imagine that there are many others interested--even if this book were one of the best examples of its kind, there is simply too much competition, too much that's newer to think that Diana Trilling's book reviews for The Nation from the forties could tempt very many away from contemporary distractions and diversions.Does anyone read criticism anymore?  Anyone other than us Ignatius Reilly types?  (Not to imply that the esteemed reviewer before me is anything of the sort.)  It seems to me that good criticism and good critics are needed more now than ever, though discounted and dismissed.  That, I think, is a function of the fractured lines that criticism has split into, with its school for every group that may feel slighted.  REVIEWING THE FORTIES is a refreshing dip into a time when it seemed worthwhile to read cultured and learned opinions of a critic who could assess--without worrying who might be offended in the process--the worth of a thing.  REVIEWING THE FORTIES is representative of a time when people believed there could be a monolithic culture, an idea that has fallen so far out of favor as to be laughable nowadays.Still, I have to admit, I wish that it could still be that way.  Whether or not there is a direct causality to it, I think a case could be made for the fractured state of criticism today contributing to the awful state of contemporary literature.  Others are free to disagree--it's okay, I don't mind.Of course, writing short reviews of new releases isn't really criticism, per se--it is instead an opportunity for Ms. Trilling to speak intelligently about each book, and, in some instances, about the state of literature in general.  In this, she complements well one of her colleagues writing at near the same time--James Agee, whose expositions on film can be found in AGEE ON FILM, VOL 1, which is really quite fantastic.  Agee used his moderate venue to comment on American society and man's tendencies in general that put simple film reviews completely in the shade.  Diana Trilling misses that sort of expansive commentary by an eyelash--it may be that the fodder for her column never quite rose to as affecting of a level as Agee's did (some of his reviews took in footage shot at the collapse of the Third Reich)--but the sad truth is that many of the books that Ms. Trilling had for assignment would be what I might think of as simply diversionary, and her response to them remained on that level.  There were a few instances, though, when she did acquire something with some meat on it--like Orwell's 1984--and when she was confronted with such, she easily rose to meet it.One wouldn't read REVIEWING THE FORTIES for its concrete criticism of any particular book anymore than one would read Agee's book in order to pick out a film to watch tonight.  It's their opinion in the aggregate that is what's worthwhile, and because that aggregate is less noticeable in Ms. Trilling's book, I think of it as four stars.  There is still the pleasure of reading an intelligent mind at work though, and that is not to be discouraged. (Since most of my review has been full of hot air, I direct you to the previous reviewer who does a much better job of reviewing it than I do.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZM1IODQAQ1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151770840#wasThisHelpful","RGZM1IODQAQ1T","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The very best books are those that are most difficult for me to review--it is difficult to avoid sliding into the clich√©d descriptions that too often are attached to mediocre works, and which would actually dim the luster of those that are superior.  It is also difficult to express exactly why the very best are the very best--it cannot be just excellent style, or craftsmanship, or compelling stories and characters; it is something that is more than the sum of its parts, and while there is no shortage of clich√©d phrases for this aspect of the very best as well, the only really truthful thing I might be able to say about them is that rather than engaging only my emotions--as pleasurable as that might be--the very best books shed light on how I see myself in the world.THE POWER AND THE GLORY is mostly straightforward, and simply told--Greene uses few literary flourishes.  It is the story of a Catholic priest--a 'whiskey' priest and father of an illegitimate daughter besides--who is hunted by the representatives of a state which has outlawed the church, and passed a death sentence on any who continue to perform the sacraments.  Pursued throughout the countryside, he is drawn inexorably closer to his fate by his responsibilities as intermediate between God and man, while at the same time tortured by his failings.The setting of the novel--a period between the world wars in rural Mexico--is surely an influence as well, but the tone of POWER AND THE GLORY reminds me of another hopeless, helpless man convinced he is beyond redemption; that of Geoffrey Firmin, the alcoholic consul from Malcolm Lowry's UNDER THE VOLCANO.  And it is also true that in both of these books, the authors have managed to inspire an affinity with these characters within me, an affinity that challenges the easy assumptions I make about the nature of the world, secure as I am in a cocoon of security and plenty.  Yet if that were all there were to these books, then I don't believe they would have the lingering impact that they do.Obviously the two novels diverge--Lowry's goes on to its painful conclusions, while Greene's offers yet a modicum of hope to this problem of existence, though it may not be the sort of hope one would wish.  It is the sort of hope that demolishes individuality, destroys free will, and subsumes all our efforts into a cruel hoax.  And that, Greene seems to be saying, is the way to redemption.Or not.  Though this novel challenges me, it is likely that it will either challenge others in ways that are meaningful to them, or else it will not penetrate deeply enough to disturb the core beliefs of still others.  Regardless, I'm convinced that this is one of THE great novels of the 20th Century, underrated while many other popular selections continue to be promoted over it.  Obviously, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REXSRYL3URZZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142437301#wasThisHelpful","REXSRYL3URZZB","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only major work that I had read by Machiavelli was his DISCOURSES ON LIVY and so my opinion on him was at odds with what I'd understood his reputation to be--the Machiavelli of THE DISCOURSES is certainly not the 'finger of Satan' that he came to be referred to after THE PRINCE.  In fact, in reading THE DISCOURSES (which I did at the height of our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan), I thought that there were folks highly placed in our government who would have benefited from reading or re-reading it.  Of course, there were folks highly placed in our government at that time who WERE referred to as Machiavellian, but that's another story.A recent comment by a friend regarding biographies in general had me taking another look at the genre, and then this fell into my lap, and I figured that it was meant to be.  Before that, I'd not thought much about the Florentine statesman, nor his times, so I was fairly neutral on the subject when I began, but author Miles Unger sucked me in right away.  I found that the first half of the book--that which preceded Machiavelli's career as a political scientist and concentrated on his time as a civil servant--was nearly un-put-downable.  I have nothing but admiration for this author's ability to write narrative history--too often, when it comes to this type of history, the authors are either unable to write without emphasizing the ironic viewpoint gained from their vantage point in the future (Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, for example), or have some larger ideal that they are working toward, and are using the historical record as building blocks for that ideal.  If there are any larger aims to Mr. Unger's work other than laying out the context for Machiavelli's later writings, then it escaped me, and I wholeheartedly recommend the book if for no other reason than this excellent history of Machiavelli's time.Where the book stumbles is in the later chapters, after Machiavelli has been deposed of his position in the city and in its political structure, and essentially put out to pasture.  Without recourse to the political struggles he enjoyed, Machiavelli turned to writing--ostensibly as a way back to the inner circle, which was the genesis of THE PRINCE.  Mr. Unger takes a chapter apiece to discuss the major works, updating the biography as he explicates passages from these same tracts.  The problem, I felt, with these last chapters is not so much Mr. Unger's explanations, but rather that there is much repetition, and too often, the author comes across as an apologist for Machiavelli.  Serious students of Machiavelli (of which I am not one) will probably find little new here, if anything, and may even term the analysis superficial.  For myself, even with as little as I know of Machiavelli's complete oeuvre, I felt the last chapters were much weaker than the preceding narrative.In order to meet in the middle, I rate the book four stars, though to someone who is brand-new to Machiavelli, or who may be reading him for the first time, I think this would be a good companion piece.  There may very well be other books dealing with his history that are as good or better, but I think Mr. Unger's style is very reader friendly without being facile or simplistic.  Now that I have a better understanding of the situation surrounding Florence in the early 16th century, I'm tempted to pull down THE DISCOURSES again--I feel as though what I've read by Mr. Unger will have enlarged my understanding of the context that formed the basis of that book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2DYR749VW3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416556281#wasThisHelpful","R3S2DYR749VW3O","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in 1941, ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM was Erich Fromm's analysis of the psychological character of certain social groups that had been swayed by the Fascist message.  By using psychoanalytic techniques, he presents his case by showing how economic and social conditions had molded different groups within that society to be particularly amenable to the fascist message:  changes in the existing socio-economic structure freed man from bonds that may have limited his individual freedom, but had also provided a firm foundation of security.  Rather than having a positive effect, this new freedom left man feeling isolated and alone, setting up an anxious striving for a return to that primitive security.  In this state, the social character of certain groups was receptive to fascist ideology, as that ideology seemed to relieve the existing anxiety.Fromm's techniques may seem quaint by today's standards--though I'm certainly no expert.  As far as where the practice of psychology is today, or Fromm's relevance to it, I can't begin to touch on.  What I can say is that as a complete outsider, I found some of the discussions in ESCAPE fascinating, and some tedious and dry.  Similar to Bruno Bettelheim's USES OF ENCHANTMENT, I found that some of Fromm's conclusions resonated with me, regardless of how he arrived at them.  In fact, I found the first four chapters of ESCAPE to be very interesting--covering nearly half of the book, I read them in one sitting.  Unfortunately, the next hundred pages felt like an interminable slog.  I was glad that I stuck with it though, as the last chapter again felt fresh and insightful.This first section that I mentioned is an analysis of the social structure at the end of the Middle Ages, when capitalism first started chipping away at the feudal system.  According to Fromm, under feudalism, every man knew his place, and while this rigid structure severely inhibited man's ability to be an individual, it also provided him with a sense of security and a place in the universe.  But as the forms of feudalism began to erode, man was cut adrift from those old sureties, and experienced fear and isolation.  With nothing in place to encourage his new freedoms, man became desperate for a new message, which men like Martin Luther and John Calvin were ready to provide.Whether the term 'Marxist' specifically applies to Fromm or not is probably splitting hairs--in ESCAPE he certainly draws from that tradition; hence, capitalism, more than just a means of production, is also the wellspring of social changes--in this case, the Protestant Reformation.  Thus, economic and social forces set in motion changes to the social character which lead to demands for new conventions, which tend to reinforce the psychological underpinnings that led to the demand in the first place.  This pattern repeats itself in the 1930's: although social and economic changes following the First World War had freed large sections of people from old bonds, people experienced this as freedom FROM security, and feelings of isolation and fear returned.  This was fertile soil for figures such as Hitler to sow his message of nationalism and racial superiority.I'm not sure if it takes an in-depth study such as Fromm's to arrive intuitively at this conclusion, yet I do think it helps clarify it some.  Again, it isn't necessary to agree with Fromm's techniques for me to see that his ideas bear looking into (others are free to disagree), and that is where I think the value of books such as ESCAPE comes from, regardless of whether they are dated or not.  The question then becomes one of relativity--is the amount of insight gleaned worth the time spent, and are there other, more recent works that cover this ground in a more effective manner.To the first part, I can answer yes; that for me, the drudgery involved was worth it in the end, but not by a wide margin.  The second part I'm unable to answer, having little experience in that regard.  What I can say about ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM is that with it's first half and final chapter, I picked up insights that I thought were helpful to me--helpful in the sense that I thought they gave me more ways of looking at the social character, from both the time of the Reformation and also from today's time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY2KOZHEP5Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805031499#wasThisHelpful","R2JY2KOZHEP5Q6","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised that there are so few reviews for this work by Himes, whose output doesn't seem to be nearly well known enough for its grit and punch--or, if for nothing else, two of the best-named detectives in all of crime fiction: Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson.THE CRAZY KILL is no cosy, and even though it was written back in the fifties, I wouldn't say it was tame by today's standards either, though it probably isn't nearly as shocking as it may have once been.  I get the feeling Himes pushed the envelope pretty hard with this book--perhaps in all of his novels; this is the first I've read.  It's like the direct ancestor of Iceberg Slim's books--and I'm sure Himes opened some doors for a more realistic tone when describing the culture of a place like Harlem.  Or I suppose it is--I'm probably as well qualified to judge authenticity when depicting Harlem as I am Merovingian France.  Still, Himes is convincing.The plot of THE CRAZY KILL was a little hard to get a handle on at first, and there are several characters introduced right at the beginnning, so I had some trouble keeping everything straight, but eventually it seemed to settle down.  At the wake of Big Joe Pullen--a patriarch of sorts for a loose-knit group of people--the brother-in-law of Big Joe's godson is found murdered, but who would want to murder the easy-going Val, and why?  From there, Himes follows his cast of characters, exploring their lives and their profiles, while Coffin Ed and Gravedigger roam around in the background for the first half of the novel.  This has its pluses and minuses--the action, pace, and interest picks up when Gravedigger and Coffin Ed are on center stage, but the commitment to developing the assorted other characters is what gives the book its cultural flavor.Himes writes in the tradition of Jim Thompson and Richard Stark--not as amoral as those, but gritty and violent.  Or should I say gritty and violent in the service of the story, rather than as the point of the story.  A thin line, for sure, but critical.There are weaknesses here--the plot is somewhat convoluted and feels a bit contrived at the end, and, as I said, my interest lagged when the two detectives were off-screen, but I look forward to reading more of Himes's work.  I don't know if THE CRAZY KILL is the best representative of Himes's, or just middling, but a couple of his books are included in Crime and Mystery: The 100 Best Books, for what it's worth (not THE CRAZY KILL, however), so chances are he was able to take the same setting and make it even better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13BSL5ZPL5L5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BUG6P2#wasThisHelpful","R13BSL5ZPL5L5I","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I'd never read any of John Cheever's novels--and few, if any of his short-stories until just recently--that didn't stand in the way of my forming an opinion on his work, an opinion which, as I find most of them are when I actually get some experience with the subject, was completely wrong-headed.  It's like forming a mental picture of someone you've never seen and whom you are talking to on the telephone--it's never even remotely close.  I had expected smug and caustic, but instead found it tender-hearted and full of self-deprecating humor.WAPSHOT exposes the foibles of this provincial New England family, concentrating mostly on the three male characters, Leander and his two sons, Moses and Coverly.  The family exists on the largesse of their spinster cousin Honora, who decides that the oldest boy, Moses, needs to go out into the world and prove himself.  Coverly chooses to follow suit, and the second half of the book records the trials of the two boys as they take their small-town personalities into the big, changing world of the 1950's, and of their father, who watches his own world disintegrate as change comes even to the tiny hamlet of St. Botolphs.Cheever is probably best known for this novel and his short-stories, and in fact, THE WAPSHOT CHRONICLE often reads like a string of tenously connected short vignettes, which come together quite nicely, I think, as a effective novel--though obviously this technique will not resonate with everyone.  Complaints about loose ends, or characters that seem to wander on stage for no particular reason and then wander off again, are justified--that's all there, to be sure, but in WAPSHOT, at any rate, I think it works well.  I think it enlarges the picture that Cheever is able to paint, which is critical to the theme I noticed in the book--that of the old being overtaken by the new, and not much good about it either, although most seemed resigned to it.Not so much Leander though, the patriarch, whose emasculation (and by extension, that of St. Botolph's itself) by the civlizing grace of femininity he fights the best he is able.  His son, Coverly, meanwhile, epitomizes the soulless new structure of the American work force by taking a job which entails transcribing binary code onto tape for the early computers of the space age.  Perhaps Cheever is hinting that the modern world is first stripping us of our masculinity, and then our humanity.  If so, I can't find a lot of fault with it.The risk of writing a book that is full of nostalgic sweetness is overdoing it, of rendering a portrait made of syrup.  Cheever's saving grace in WAPSHOT is realizing that nostalgia for the the characters of yesterday should never cloud the fact that they were still characters, in the sense that they were as flawed as any other humans.  That's where the self-deprecation shows--Cheever is unabashadly on the side of these remnants, but is also quick to show up their faults as well.  Yet it is the book's tenderness that I think is it's strongest point.  The evocation of familial bonds, without the hyperactive and shrill tendencies of more modern accounts, is pleasant and familiar to me--perhaps that's nostalgia on MY part.Readers who are not familiar with Cheever's novel but have enjoyed the earlier works of John Irving might look to this literary ancestor--it seems like a direct descent from one to the other, though actually, I prefer Cheever for his understatement rather than Mr. Irving's over-achievement. In the end, while many of Cheever's specific themes have lost some of their potency simply because the changes he catalogues are part of our landscape now, the fond affection and love for family and place remains, without ever becoming over-sweet.  And that, I think, is something worth reading about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROD8H3XUQ5GC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060528877#wasThisHelpful","ROD8H3XUQ5GC9","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As there are no biographical notes in the edition of THE DISSOLUTION that I have, nor a 'look inside' feature for the current edition, it may be helpful to provide some information on the book and the author.  THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HABSBURG MONARCHY was first published in 1929.  Its author, Oscar J√°szi, was born near the Hungarian-Romanian border in 1875, and agitated for reform in the Hungarian political process and social issues.  He left Hungary in 1919, after the Hungarian revolution, and after a Soviet-influenced regime took over the government.  (Information on the author derived from Wikipedia--a biography of J√°szi can also be found here.)I post this information for the simple reason that I find J√°szi's analyses compelling; unfortunately, my understanding of this time period and this part of the world is cursory, and I could have been easily persuaded by arguments contrived by the author which would not hold up to examination by those more familiar with the time and events.  Given that the author was intimately involved with the situation he analyzes, both before the fall of the Monarchy and as a member of the post-Habsburg government of Hungary, my concern was, despite the calm and measured approach of the book, that J√°szi would not be able to distance himself far enough to escape the inherent bias of his unique position.  Rather than foolishly recommending a book with which I have little experience in the subject matter, I thought it would be best to provide what data I could, and other readers could form their own opinion.The Habsburgs ruled Austria and the Danube Region for four centuries, and J√°szi's book is an attempt to answer the question of `whether the Danubian experiment was due to fail because it was...a natural impossibility, or because it was only a consequence of factors depending on will and insight which could have been avoided by a more advanced statesmanship.'  In order to answer that question, the book is divided into seven parts, the first of which serves as a sort of introduction and the last as an addendum on the state of civic education in the region and as a summation.  But it is the five intervening parts that make up the bulk of the book, and are J√°szi's attempt to answer the question he posed at the beginning.  The Historical Atmosphere, The Centripetal Forces, The Centrifugal Forces, The Dynamics of Centrifugal Forces and The Dangers of Irredenta outline in exhaustive detail the unique situation of the Habsburg realm; the history of the Habsburgs, the antithetical forces affecting the monarchy, and the desire for ethnic minorities within the empire to join with those nations outside of Austria and Hungary who shared their language and background.To J√°szi, writing in 1927, the question he posed was not simply an exercise in what might have been; he understood it to be of vital importance: Because the Habsburgs failed to find or employ answers to the most pressing problems affecting their empire, and because many of those same problems affected the region after Versailles, J√°szi saw the examination of the problem as an opportunity to formulate practical policies and reforms that could stabilize the newly independent countries.  Whether his solutions could have worked at the time or not is, of course, unknowable, but contemporary history of the region tends to bear out the idea that there were still many unresolved issues between the basin's inhabitants.Irrespective of J√°szi's conclusions, the analysis of the region is convincing.  It is important, though, to understand that THE DISSOLUTION is not popular history, nor even academic, narrative history, but rather political science.  Therefore J√°szi's focus is on sociological and cultural repercussions of the Monarchy's actions, which then formed popular opinion and often fueled and intense hatred of the Habsburg rule.  While I don't believe any one book to be `definitive', I can say that THE DISSOLUTION does a better job than anything else I've read to make sense of the antagonistic forces that made up the empire.  And, although the book is not about WWI, both the Monarchy and the war are so inextricably linked that many of the same pressures that led to the downfall of the Monarchy were part and parcel of the root causes of the war as it was fought in the Balkans.As a consequence of the book's aim and of its organization, I found it to be extremely dry and, at times, tiring.  While this would normally be a strike against, in this case, I don't believe there was any other effective way to transmit the information that J√°szi needed to convey in order to make his analysis complete.  The background of the region is not so simply disentangled, and while the raw data does not necessarily make for fascinating reading, it was necessary to go beyond simple explanations for the dissolution of the monarchy.  To say that the Habsburg rule was torn apart by nationalistic urges of its citizens is all well and good; but what J√°szi is able to accomplish is to give this reader a clear understanding of how these urges came about, what supported them, what options the Monarchy had to counter them, why the Monarchy failed to do so, and to intimate whether anything COULD have been done to change the situation.  In the end, it seems to this reader that J√°szi's position was that large groups of traditionally disenfranchised people were slowly awakened to nationalistic feeling as a by-product of the Industrial Revolution, and began to agitate for broader recognition.  The traditional elites, out of fear of losing their inherited status, recoiled against anything that would disrupt the status quo, and therefore tried to squash this nationalistic feeling.  This, of course, was a complete failure, and when the disenfranchised saw that they would find no relief within the Monarchy, they began to edge away.  The assassination at Sarajevo became a convenient way for these two opposing forces to carry their arguments a step further, and to try to achieve their objectives by force of arms rather than through a political process.Thinking about J√°szi's initial question, I would say that while the author seems to feel that something could have been done to prevent the dissolution, when I look at the same data and add in my own opinion about human nature, I would say there was not anything that would have changed the course of the Monarchy.  But no matter what conclusion one might take away from the book, it is the careful analyses of the various issues that make this book a treasure trove for anyone studying this time period and this area of the world.  I'm reminded of Theodore Hamerow's Restoration, Revolution, Reaction: Economics and Politics in Germany, 1815-1871, in that the book is immensely detailed, but authoritative on its subject (in this case, the German Revolution of 1848).  Like Hammerow's book, THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HABSBURG MONARCHY is indispensable for students of its subject, and an important component to any library concerned with the Habsburgs and WWI.  Highly recommended, with the single caveat that it is very dry reading, and those who are interested, but are used to modern, faster-paced accounts will want to prepare for a methodical, in-depth analysis which took more concentration from this reader than I am used to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TGD03P1J3FMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1258149753#wasThisHelpful","R3TGD03P1J3FMN","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This three-DVD set containing the documentary in five episodes produced for British television in the 1980's is quite excellent, and highly recommended for those who are interested in the French experience in Algeria, but have little background knowledge of the period.  The first disc attempts to cover the history of the French in Algeria, and the cultural and social makeup of the region.  This, because of its function, is a trifle less dramatic than the following episodes.  The second and third disc have two different hour-long episodes each, which describe how the insurgency began, the Pied Noir's reaction, the French army's reaction, the tactics used in fighting the insurgency, the return of Charles de Gualle as the Algerian problem broke government after government, the political maneuvering to find a solution, and the terror campaign conducted by the OAS.There is no such thing as an objective documentary, but some wear their opinions more openly than others.  Unfortunately, I've reached the conclusion that the less subjectivity one sees in a documentary, the more careful you should be, because that only means the filmmakers were better at concealing their bias from the viewer.  In ALGERIAN WAR, it is nearly impossible to pick up a 'slant', or an outright bias toward one side or the other, though there are groups and personalities involved in the war that come off as less admirable than others.  One has to determine whether he was 'led' in that direction by the filmmakers, or if it derives from the actions of the historical participants.  The producers of ALGERIAN WAR try to sidestep this question by relying heavily on newsreel footage from the time, and on interviews with many of its leading figures still alive years after the conflict.  Still, it is difficult to come away from the production without forming an opinion that such-and-such group was in the wrong, or that another group was justified.  Perhaps it is human nature to form such opinions, but I have to remind myself it is unproductive to judge past peoples for their action because that leads to an attitude of 'it can't happen here'.  Better to simply try to learn from the outcome, and decide whether the past's attitudes and actions are those we would choose today.And that leads directly into an almost uncanny moment of d√©ja vu as the documentary details the French army's intelligence-gathering tactics.  The descriptions, the recrimination, and regret over the use of torture during the Battle of Algiers and other periods parallel so closely the debate 50 years later that went on in America about Guantanamo that it was startling.  And, even though we are not as far away in time from the 'War on Terror' as we are from the Algerian conflict, I think the judgment on both those policies is properly negative.  Which brings me back to the point about judging peoples from the past: If we judge the people to be 'wrong' or holding the wrong ideas, then that leaves open the possibility that the *tactics* of those people could still be employed as long as *we* are right-minded.  To prove the point--the French were less than fifteen years away from the terror of the Gestapo, yet many people in a position of authority (but not all, by any means) saw no problem employing similar tactics on the Algerians.This insight, or reminder, if you will, into human behavior and the use (or un-use, in this case) of the lessons of the past made ALGERIAN WAR worth the viewing, even if there had been no other positives.  Yet the whole series is well-done, if, perhaps unavoidably, condensed. It is a very easily digestible way to become familiar with a subject that I have not seen or heard much more of than only the most cursory treatment.  It is, I think, an excellent overview, and perfect for launching into deeper study, should one wish, or as a way of rounding out one's education about mid-twentieth century history.Deduct half a star for no subtitles or CC for hearing impaired, which I find helpful at times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3120U4RI9EEPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YQXBPM#wasThisHelpful","R3120U4RI9EEPH","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the audio recording of ON THE ROAD, read by Matt DillonI had avoided ON THE ROAD for many years, despite its reputation as a classic, for two reasons:  I thought it would be dense and difficult to read, and I thought it wouldn't be very good.  Why I assumed either one, I don't know; I believe that is called contempt prior to investigation.  I probably would never have gotten around to reading it (or, in this case, listening), if I hadn't run across this audio version at a local library sale, and, always on the lookout for something to listen to while making long trips, decided to give it a chance.I can't add anything to what's been written already about Jack Kerouac's extended road trip, other than it isn't anywhere near as challenging as I thought it would be going in.  Like any style, it will have its supporters and detractors, but the actual narrative is straightforward and fairly simple.  At times, it even sounds unpolished, like a first or second draft, where the author is rushing to get all the broad strokes down, sacrificing the finer details in order to get the story on paper before he loses touch with it.  From what I've read, this was Kerouac's intention--a style of writing that was raw and immediate, rather than slick.  Either way, there's vibrancy to this story, a sort of wild-eyed enthusiasm that I found infectious and free-spirited--which is surely at least part of what Kerouac hoped for.It seems to me there's something unique about ON THE ROAD, at least something I've never come across before.  The portrait of America that Kerouac's disjointed prose elicits seems real, honest.  Maybe it's because I've seen and read so much whitewash from this time period, but ON THE ROAD makes the country feel vast again, even interesting.  It might even make me long for the `good old days', except then I remember the character in the book of Bull Lee (supposedly based on William Burroughs), who, even in the late 1940's, was looking even further back for an entirely different set of good old days.I think ON THE ROAD is an American classic, whether or not Kerouac's technical proficiency measures up to other, more talented authors.  To my mind, it puts him in a class with Mark Twain and HUCKLEBERRY FINN.  It is a novel that is able to actually communicate the experience of a time and place, without the author attempting to manipulate the reader toward a certain viewpoint.  Interestingly enough, upon release one critic said, it 'disappoints because it constantly promises a revelation or a conclusion of real importance and general applicability, and cannot deliver any such conclusion because Dean is more convincing as an eccentric than as a representative of any segment of humanity.'  I think it is precisely this `failure' that makes it worthwhile--any attempt by Kerouac to deliver a message would have destroyed the sheer originality of the book, and forced it to conform.  Thankfully, it never does.I wasn't too sure about Matt Dillon as a reader--though I could see linking him to some of the characters of ON THE ROAD, maybe even Sal Paradise himself.  (A young, manic Brad Pitt might have done a great Dean Moriarty).  There are other audio editions, with Will Patton and John Ventimiglia as readers, and if I'd had the option, I probably would have gone with Will Patton, based solely on the excellent job he did with Jim Thompson's POP 1280.  But in the end, I was satisfied with Dillon's performance.  A little monotone, perhaps, but overall, sufficient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B10XPDL3U2RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060755334#wasThisHelpful","R3B10XPDL3U2RE","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can one really say about BY LOVE POSSESSED, James Gould Cozzens's last (1957) successful sprawling novel?  Some good, some bad, I suppose: here's the lowdown for people who like short reviews--I liked it more than I didn't, though I'd think the audience for such a book is miniscule.  All the diatribes against it aside, the charges often leveled at the book are true to some degree: it is dated, dense, uncharitable (to be nice about it) toward religion in general and Catholics specifically, and judgmental toward anyone not white, professional and heterosexual.  Cozzens's style is difficult--the constant interruption of every sentence by multiple clauses, side notes, asides, parentheticals, digressions, definitions and word play rendered some passages frankly unintelligible.  I couldn't recommend it to anyone.And yet, I wouldn't NOT recommend it either, were someone to express interest.  As I said, I liked it, despite its writing style and its prejudices.  Many people are simply not going to be able to get past those problems--or, more likely, the mid-century attitudes and outlooks--but the book is not about those prejudices or the mores of the 1950's, even if these may be the most glaring points to readers sixty years later.  The real issue that the book grapples with is exposing the reality behind the faÁade of (1950's) society, and whether or not it is possible for a man of principle to co-exist with that reality.  The difference between Cozzens and other, less forgotten mid-century writers who were also concerned with peeling this particular onion, is that Cozzens remains essentially positive about his society, despite its faults.The main character of BY LOVE POSSESSED, Arthur Winner, cuts through a cross-section of the town in his allotted 49 hours and is a rare thing in literature--today or then: an upstanding citizen and a good man.  Not a saint, by any means, but a good human man.  Nor is he punished for being so and is respected by his community precisely because of his qualities--also rare.  And the townspeople of Brocton are, in general, also good people, average, small-town people who make average, small-town mistakes.  After nearly 600 pages, we have a well-done sketch of the town, a little drama, and an ethical dilemma that most people would probably not think twice about.  And so, another reasonable strike against the book--there just isn't much 'there' there.What did I find to like in all that?  Well, in one sense, it was unique to me.  Admirable men do not exist in modern literature without having been punished for it by life and circumstances and (sometimes) redeemed by novel's end, or else they harbor some bizarre secret as either a fraud or predator.  Arthur Winner has some of his illusions swept away, but one feels as though this is more of life's maturing process rather than a punishing blow (although I think one could reasonably ask what took him so long to learn this lesson).  And, even though Cozzens's description of this society could, at times, give off a distinct stale odor, I also found it an interesting dissection--interesting enough, at least, to keep the pages turning.Was it all captivating?  Not really.  Often I felt I was rolling my eyes at one page, yet drawn in on the next.  Although I don't like comparing authors or their works, I will say that I was reminded of Steinbeck's WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT several times throughout the novel, even though BY LOVE POSSESSED is the superior book--far superior.  I wouldn't say the themes are necessarily what's so similar, even though both deal with ethical and moral problems, but rather that the descriptions and dialogue are often comparable--Steinbeck comes off artificial and melodramatic, and Cozzens, on occasion, reads that way as well.To my mind, I see that as the biggest problem in BY LOVE POSSESSED--the author seems trapped by certain conventions that just don't date well.  That, I think, is also the source for the casual racism, sexism, and homophobia that is shot through the book--in fact, I'd wager that Cozzens thought he was being quite tolerant.  Taken together, these are by no means insignificant flaws.  For me, the interest in the character of Arthur Winner, and challenge of untangling Cozzens's stream-of-conscious interludes makes this one more positive than not, though not by a wide margin.

"I was unaware of C.P. Snow until I ran across an essay taken from his book The Two Cultures, which discussed the divide between scientists and those who study literature.  A bit of cursory research turned up information on his series of eleven novels, loosely grouped together as the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, of which TIME OF HOPE is first in chronological order, though third in published order.  Narrated, as are all of the books, by Lewis Eliot, TIME OF HOPE is an account of his life from a boy to a twenty-eight-year-old man, a boy determined to rise above the social and pecuniary restraints of his origins and move into a strata which would normally be denied him.  It is also the story of his ruinous infatuation for Sheila Knight, a woman born into the class he is striving for, and how he gains both the higher position and the woman, though success may be as elusive as ever.I don't know whether TIME OF HOPE would have a large circle of supporters anymore, even if it was promoted; it is not a 'fast-paced' read, nor is it sensational in any respect.  Instead, it is dense and deliberate, and the emotional toll that its characters suffer mirrors reality rather than any melodramatic posturing.  And, whether or not Snow set out to write 'literature', TIME OF HOPE has none of the self-important odor of so much modern literary fiction I've read, nor does it flippantly and caustically dispose of the absurdity of modern life by smugly asserting its keen sense of observation and distance.  It is straightforward and honest, and its depth arises out of a genuine sympathy for the human condition.It's a shame that so many weaker novels from its time are still celebrated, and yet TIME OF HOPE is relatively obscure.  I would like to recommend it, as I thought that for me, it was one of the best novels I've read this year, but I just don't know how wide its appeal would be.  This doesn't mean I think it is dated--rather that its style is cultured in a manner that I don't see very often.  Still, to my mind, Snow was able to capture abiding elements of life; how it isn't dramatic, how it goes on, messily; how it isn't a stage, and how there is no denouement to our lives.I'm often disappointed by 'literature'--I feel much of it promises what it does not deliver.  TIME OF HOPE, in its methodical, understated way, actually outshines novels which may have clever turns or brilliantly written passages, but fail to put these flourishes to any use other than to demonstrate the author's capability.  In this instance, Snow's deliberate pace--which will not resonate with all readers--infused the narrative with its own sort of tension.  Readers who have felt short-changed by more dramatic works may also find, as I did, that Snow's style is fulfilling as well as enjoyable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12A5FVFSZ8MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VZGVKC#wasThisHelpful","R12A5FVFSZ8MB","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with Leslie Purnell Davies, who, it turns out, was fairly prolific through the sixties and seventies in the mystery and science-fiction field, but was also a bit of a mystery himself.  No matter, interested readers can search him out on the web to find out more as I did, or refer to S. T. Joshi's The Evolution of the Weird Tale and read the chapter devoted to Davies, which is where I first heard of him, if they are curious.  I was surprised that I *hadn't* heard of him before--I've spent a lot of time browsing through stacks of science-fiction paperbacks, and the name never rang a bell.TWILIGHT JOURNEY (1967) may not be Davies's best work (Who is Lewis Pinder? seems to get a lot of print:  AKA Man out of nowhere) but it was an interesting start.  According to Mr. Joshi, the common theme running through all of Davies's work is identity; the main character is usually unsure of who he really is.  TWILIGHT JOURNEY follows that general idea, to a point; the inventor of a device that can script your dreams infiltrates the project he left behind years before, posing as a student undergoing a dream tutorial.  Initially, in his dream, he is lost and confused, and it is only as the book goes on that both the reader and the dreamer discover his real purpose.Davies actually writes well--not a given in the science-fiction field--and his idea in TWILIGHT JOURNEY is pretty good, though it's been revisited many times since.  In fact, the book reminded me of a mash-up of The Matrix and 1984, and I think many readers will also be tempted to compare Davies with Phillip K. Dick as well, though without as much paranoia and schizophrenia.  That's probably a fair comparison (though with only one reading it's hard to be sure), though I don't think Davies spun out his storylines as far as Dick was willing to--sometimes even to the detriment of the point he was trying to make.  As far as TWILIGHT JOURNEY, I kept expecting more twists that never came, and I thought Davies could have really wound the reader up with the premise he set up, but failed to maximize the potential.Still, I give the book reasonably high marks--I really wanted to like it, and I did, so take that into consideration when looking at my rating.  I do look forward to reading him again, to see if he is a little more risky in his plot, but TWILIGHT JOURNEY was still an enjoyable read.  I'm glad I finally found out about him--better late than never--and already have The Artificial Man in my stack of to-be-read-sooner-rather-than-later books.  That's about as good of a recommendation as I can give.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQI9CQ0NPZNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NDXDMA#wasThisHelpful","R3GQI9CQ0NPZNU","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the surface, THE DREAM LIFE OF SUKHANOV is the story of a man whose past--which he thought he had successfully buried and forgotten--is resurrected by chance occurrence and through the social stirrings caused by the early effects of Gorbachev's policies in the former Soviet Union.  That past, which he re-experiences through his 'dream life', suggests that years before, he sold out, trading in his dreams of artistic success for the comfort available to an apparatchik in the Soviet system.Though the particulars may be unique, the idea of picking at the scab of our regrets years later strikes me as a common trait, and is with this universal theme that I thought the book resonated best.  If there were no other subtext, no other deeper themes running through the book, then I'd say Ms. Grushin's story was more favorable than not, though not by an extreme margin.  It took a long time for me to get interested in the story--I was on the verge of not finishing the book several times.  I also had a general idea of where the story was headed after a few chapters, and though Ms. Grushin's writing ability (especially given that English is not her first language) is serviceable and her characters well-crafted, nothing in the telling urged me on to the end.It also seems to me that the story falls into a pattern that I've seen before--a middle-aged man--a father, husband and son--is plagued by mistakes from the past which haunt and influence his present; he loses his wife, his children detach from him and think him a fool, and he is driven by the demands his parents have put on him, either in reality or from the grave.  His job disintegrates, his social standing disappears, and his mental state declines, even as he expends more and more effort to keep things together--almost always efforts in exactly the wrong direction.  The most recent book I've read that also follows that pattern was Richard Russo's THAT OLD CAPE MAGIC, which had the added clich√© of having an academic setting, though, overall, was a much more light-hearted approach.What is so seductive about that set of parameters is that, to a large extent, they are a common reality--satisfying the real or imagined demands of parents is difficult, marriages disintegrate for many reasons, and children often think their parents have made grievous mistakes in their upbringing.  But it has almost become dogmatic to place the failure of these units at the feet of the man.  The crux of DREAM LIFE is that Sukharov 'sold out' when he was a starving artist living off of his wife's meager income.  The situation is contrived so that his alternatives are prison (possibly), starvation (more likely), or get in line.  Thinking about his suffering wife, he gets in line.  Years later, she can no longer bear the apparatchik life that he chose, so she leaves him to go stay in the dacha that that apparatchik life has provided.  My irony meter may be broken, but as far as I can tell, this is played straight up by the author.  Sukhanov's children both hold him in contempt for his past (and present), yet take advantage of every opportunity his life choices has provided them.  And, in the end, Sukhanov embraces his guilt, which nearly reaches religious fervor.  In fact, he ends up interpreting it as the necessary chrysalis from which he can finally emerge as the artist he always had the potential to be.That the last third of the book likely takes place only in his mind makes no difference; nor does the fact that Sukhanov's mental state has become completely unreliable toward the end.  What is significant is Anatoly's newfound confidence in his axiomatic guilt; in the closing pages, as a new artistic consciousness floods his mind, it is Adam he imagines in his mind, holding the apple, as Eve dances nearby with butterflies in her hair.A friend of mine recently voiced the opinion that many men have little interest in contemporary literature.  I had to agree--at least in my case, I have found little to appreciate.  As to why, my short answer is that we are often portrayed as licentious bumbling fools.  While Anatoly Sukhanov is thankfully none of those, by slyly coupling his character to the tottering communist state, we are encouraged to see him as representative of another aspect of the corrupt system in need of deconstruction.  And deconstructed he is--both by the deus ex machina of mental illness, and by the relentless dismantling of his family and his standing in society.THE DREAM LIFE OF SUKHANOV, with it's themes of regret and starting anew will certainly appeal to a great many readers--I'm certainly in the minority in how I evaluated the book, and chances are, if you enjoy literary fiction, you'll like SUKHANOV.  But, right or wrong, it seemed to me as if the book forces a metamorphosis upon Anatoly that is contrived to move him from a politically incorrect stance to a safer, gelded existence.  We count on characters to change in a novel, and expect complexity in their natures, but portraying Anatoly's guilt as inherent--as the starting point--advances a viewpoint I can't agree with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GXA20MM6EZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399152989#wasThisHelpful","R22GXA20MM6EZJ","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My knowledge of Ivo Andri√¶ and Balkan history were almost non-existent when I first picked this book up, and it was with the hope of learning more about this historically important area that I bought it.  While I can't say that THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA actually outlined the history of this area as well as I had hoped, I found the narrative of the village of Visegrad fascinating and compelling in its own right, and far more fulfilling than a simple historical account.The bridge that crosses the eponymous river is a linking symbol for several different concepts; east and west, Christian and Muslim, Europe and the Orient, and, perhaps most important, past and present; and, like Virginia Woolf once said about her lighthouse, is a perfect 'central line...to hold the design together'.  It is the bridge, which the Grand Vizier ordered built in 1566, which provides the platform for Andri√¶'s story, which is comprised of the legends and tales surrounding the building of it all the way until the first years of the first world war.When reading THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA, I couldn't help think about James Michener's style of writing, which, in a rough way, is how this book is constructed - rather than follow any one character or family through the ages, the connecting thread is the bridge, which grows to seem almost as permanent as the river it crosses.  Yet where Michener's writing always seemed to me to be a little too black and white when it came to characterization and themes, Andri√¶ elicits a warm humanism despite the significant flaws of the townspeople and those that come to rule over them.  In fact, one of the strongest themes that the author brings out is just how such disparate groups (Christians, Serbs, Turks, Muslims, Jews, and other settlers throughout the years) were able to function peacefully and prosperously until the dawn of the modern world, which one could do worse than to mark as the 28th of June, 1914.If the reader were only interested in the historical record, I might suggest they return to THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA after they had a grasp of the history, as THE BRIDGE is well suited to fill in the gaps, to give a human face to that history.  But, even if knowledge of events might add to the enjoyment of THE BRIDGE, I thought it was entirely satisfactory with only a rudimentary idea of the larger picture.  More importantly, it is the sort of account that makes me feel closer to people a world away, emphasizing our similarities rather than our exotic differences.  That it does this without apparent contrivance or manipulation is superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NPYZ4XH2UTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NU0LVK#wasThisHelpful","R5NPYZ4XH2UTN","AODKUG6FAKD2Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AODKUG6FAKD2Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was okay. I did not see Edgeworth as sweet as he is towards the heroine like I wanted to. I kept thinking about him from Drew's book and every time he was not with Drew, he was bedding some woman in the nearest room. In this book, he says he tries to steer clear of women but I do not see him like that. I did not like him in Drew's story because he was a waste of a man and I do not feel he had a right or reason to act like he did.

"Nothing was solved for me. He was ashamed of what he made her when in a fit of anger made her his mistress instead of wife. He never took her anywhere because he did not want others to look down on her. He took other women though and the heroine knew of it which destroyed her sense of worth because she thought he was cheating on her. He never did cheat on her but she never learns that, he tells his mom that nothing ever happened with those girls but he just did not want to go alone to the theater so the heroine never knew this and it was a major part of her leaving him. He treated her like crap for over a year and only became a rake in the first place because it was expected of the man whom had the title to behave that way. That was stupid, he never had any joy in it but did bad things anyways. He was full of himself and walked all over the heroine. It would have been a good story if more was added on or if it showed how repentant he was but it ended abruptly. She told him why she kicked him out and he said he was sorry and stuff but he treated her that way for a YEAR because he was upset at her going somewhere with another guy after she turned down his marriage proposal of duty. It really needed MORE. He needed to truly understand the damage done to her and the hurt he caused, though naively done. I know he thought to spare her ridicule from others but he just hurt her again and again with taking other women to events he enjoyed and telling her she could not go when she asked if she could. Then to tell her about those nights because he sought absolution for taking someone else, when he only wanted her, and felt guilty. She was hurt by knowing he was with other women and thought he was telling her to be cruel sometimes, especially since he never took her ANYWHERE and she thought he was bedding all those other women, because they were opera dancers and of that sort. He needed to suffer and grovel to me, it would have made it a really good book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BB1N2RF0IJFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNWOZ9I#wasThisHelpful","R3BB1N2RF0IJFP","AVGYENZU56KBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVGYENZU56KBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, first and foremost, anyone that had anything to do with writing and editing this story needs to go back to school. There is a serious issue with your knowledge of Biology!!! On page 97, the hero and heroine are discussing that there were no children his age where he grew up and the heroine asked ""what about girls?"" and he said ""girls?"" to which the heroine replied ""you know, the humans with the x and y chromosomes.""!!! GIRLS DO NOT HAVE X AND Y CHROMOSOMES, THEY HAVE XX CHROMOSOMES!!! Men have x and y. They are sex chromosomes and distinguish which sex your baby will be. I swear I looked at that statement for 5 minutes wondering at the sheer stupidity of how many people this story had to go through to get published. That is not to mention that the story itself was not good. He stayed faithful to their marriage and she cheated. Then he wanted to stay married and keep their relationship the same but with sex added in. I do not understand some heroes and heroines. You are married!!!! It is okay to have feelings for the one you married. Why do they seem to think that getting close to another would be disastrous?

It seems all her heroes want the love of their lives as their mistresses. I would not care if they were unsuitable to the throne by their birth if you really cared for someone. This hero took the heroine to the harem, which was empty, but also where his mom lived. When he realized that he would be effectively treating her like his mom was treated, he went to correct any assumption that she would not be his bride. He did decide VERY fast to make her his bride and not mistress so he got points there but he even thought he loved her before they separated but then thought it again later like it was the first time he thought that which was weird.

They fell in love that night on first look and you can tell he is doing all this blackmail to get her with him. I do think that him feeling the way he did and seeing her again should have been a clue that she was not the heartless woman that his cousin portrayed.

"Really? First, the author said the heroine's FULL 3 PART name over and over again nonstop through the book. Why could she not be just Beth? Second, the heroine started out bubbly and full of life and completely changed after the hero asked her to be his mistress the first time. Next, the hero was nice at first then became a butthead and was mean and cruel. He kicked her out because she said no to being his mistress 5 seconds after having sex with her and then left for over a year with NO contact. Then he does come back and forces the heroine, with their daughter, back to his country to keep them ""safe"" but he threatens her repeatedly and tells her she can remain with their daughter in another home when he decides to marry a princess. That brings out another terrible point. He still had plans to marry anyone else and LET the heroine be his mistress up to 93% through the book!!!!!! This was after something had almost killed the heroine twice and he thought he loved her but still would marry someone else. Let us not forget how romantic it was for him to drop off the heroine and their daughter at the airport and leave them there without saying goodbye and then to show up AS SOON AS they arrived at their new home in England and tell the heroine that she needs to come back because he will ""submit to her rules on their relationship""! That was his marriage proposal and the heroine MELTED!!!! She was a walking doormat with Stockholm Syndrome or something. After he had treated her like crap and left for over a year and threatened her about their child, she then sleeps with him repeatedly all while he keeps bringing up it is just for that night because he cannot marry her but he will buy her a house separate from the palace so he can visit any time he wants. This is while he says his daughter will stay at the palace and be raised by him and whoever becomes his wife. He was the best example of Prince Charming to me (sarcasm).

"I really liked the young love aspect but there were some things that I really hated. He never went after her again after the initial hospital visit 15 years before. He supposedly loved her and HE was not told various lies, so why not? He said he could not navigate England at that time but he could later on, even a few years later. He had no excuse and should have went after her. I felt terrible for them and am glad they had lasting love for each other and that the love had changed to suite their grown up status. I did not like that he thought he could use her to have a baby even though he knew she lost their other one and was devastated by this. I do like that he was not the only one that moved on to other people. Normally only the male moves on and the female stays chaste. I loved how when he found her again where it all started, he resorted back to how he was when they met and she was still a strong, grown-up version of the young lady she was.

I do think that even if the hero's mistake on their wedding night was misheard, he still should not have went to see his ex-mistress. That was classless and gross, even though he went for a platonic reason. Plus the heroine stayed with him thinking he slept with the other woman!!!! How much of a doormat was she??? I wish she would have played on his jealousy more. He was a 31 year old man and she was 20. I know that he did not want to feel anything but he still should not have fought it so badly. He met her when she was 9 so I can see how he still thought of her as a child but he did love her in a weird way from the time she was 18 and married her.

I also loved how he said he had not slept with another woman since he met the heroine, even though she was engaged at that time to his stepbrother. I thought that was a sweet touch. My main problem was the hero's ex-wife. He never fully explained the scene the heroine saw on the phone.

"It was okay but since it was neither of their faults that they were separated, the story was redundant. They said the same things over and over again. Plus, she says the dress she was wearing at one point was perfect for the summer day it was but it was set at Christmas time. Ms. Darcy needs a better editor. It also bugs me that the hero had been with other women but since he thought he was betrayed, I am not as upset by that then I would be if they were just apart for other reasons. I still like my couples to stay faithful to one another during their separations.

"I really liked this one. The hero was not mean but had an amusement to his comments so it always seemed he was laughing at her innocence. I think he realized he was not in love with his ex-fianc√© and it never was love , before he even married the heroine. I think if he would have explained the photo to the heroine, they would not have had any issues on their honeymoon. I have to say that my favorite line in this book was when he found out that she was planning on escape from the get go and he was upset and said that he was hurt because ""while he was counting the days to their wedding, she was counting the days to running away"". It was just a sweet thing and left her speechless. I liked them together but she was sheltered. I do like that he realized that he was raised with love and she wasn't and that he needed to give that to her.

"Okay, right off the bat I have to say it annoyed me a lot. I mean he knew she was his first love and how he wanted her and he kept putting his daughter and the heroine in the ""us"" category but he did nothing at first. I mean he just stayed with this nasty woman he was engaged to and never once thought of her when he was with the heroine. He kept comparing the heroine with how he wanted his life to be and he knew she felt for him but still did not break things off with the OW. He said he loved the OW and then said he just thought he did because he was trying to move on in life. I do not buy it. He reenlisted and had his own home after 2 years with that woman and still barely saw her and did not live in the same state. I cannot believe he even popped the question to begin with. He was so indecisive and annoying because all he had to do was break up the OW that NO ONE liked in all his friends and just take the heroine and his daughter. It was not even like he had to fight to get the heroine, she was all his. I felt like the heroine was a dirty little secret the whole book because they did not get together until the VERY end and he broke up with his fianc√© the night AFTER. I mean come on!!!

It got old and the fact that Cameron kept pushing her away was annoying.

"It had its up's and down's. The characters talked like high school kids and not 28 year olds. I also did not like that the hero saw his girl with Jace 10 years before and did nothing but run away and sleep with everything that walked. Also, why, knowing it hurts the heroine that he slept around so much, did he make that comment about one woman's down area feeling like a brillo pad? I know he was warning his friend but come on. The heroine was right there and it was crass. I liked him to an extent and I did not really like her. She was weak and who cares that she was with child back then. She had been with the hero for 5 years at the age of 18. Why would she think she would be a burden to him? Shouldn't she know him better than that??? I mean, I know what my husband would do in certain circumstances so why shouldn't she? I know she was young, heck she still acts it, but she should have trusted her man more. I will not be reading anymore of this series because of the high school-like personalities and the fact that after not seeing each other for 10 years, they fell into bed the 2nd day and every chance since. It was so dumb because she felt she could not trust him due to how any women he was with and then she just slept with him. I mean, neither one really went and chased after the other all those years ago and if you love someone as much as they pretended to, then you fight for them from the start, not just because you think fate brought them back 10 years later and you are finally ready to fight for your love. I would have walked into that room even hearing him having sex if I wanted him. I mean, she just ran away and let him continue to act that way for 10 more years. She could have got to him, he was only acting that way to help him forget her for a few minutes. She basically admitted to stalking him saying there were times she was only a foot behind him and all he had to do was turn around to see her. Well, considering they both say that they can sense the other when they are in the room, he did a poor job back then or he would have seen her and went after her 10 years ago, The writing was just not for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIPX7TDD84IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVSF77Y#wasThisHelpful","RXIPX7TDD84IY","AVGYENZU56KBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVGYENZU56KBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was pretty good. I did have an issue. I do not mind that the heroes are womanizers before they officially meet the heroines but he met her and was drawn to her and still started an affair with an opera singer that he slept with one time before letting her go because the of the heroine. I had that in my mind for so long. I did like that he finally realized that he was not the only one to have suffered their choices being taken away and how terrible he realized he had been for his selfishness towards the heroine. He really hated that he earned a reputation as a rake and that it hurt her. He did it to escape his nightmares but it did not make them fully go away and he hated that he hurt the heroine in the process. That did redeem him a bit and he was a generally nice guy but I could not like him as my hero of this book because he did sleep with another woman after he had felt that connection for the heroine and could not stop thinking about her.

"They are SO young it is scary. I do not see a mature woman in her who had to raise her brother for the past 8 years. She is very child-like. The hero is disgusting. The heroine does not say she loves him, even though she told him from the beginning that she had to take it slow because she never had experienced this before and that she would mess up, so he dumps her. Then he dates another girl for a couple of months and holds her hand all over campus while smiling and he even sees the heroine who is not eating and is SUPER depressed. Yep, he loved her alright! (sarcasm) I mean, he did not stand by her or give her time, he just moved on and I do not care that he did not sleep with the new girl, he still kissed her and flaunted her in front of the heroine.

"The first time you are with Derek, he is plowing another woman. He then wants the heroine and pursues her for like 2 seconds before she relents only to see him with another woman.

"I bought this drill press to drill holes in 20 gauge nickel and sterling silver jewelry pieces.  It has exceeded my expectations.  If you follow the directions and let the tool do the work, you will be very pleasantly surprised that you can add such a handy device to your workbench for such low cost.  My husband, an engineer, was pretty surprised at how good it is, too.  However, I had to ask for his help with assembling it, because the assembly directions were not the greatest, and I'd never done anything like this before.  He had no problem with it, though.  The metals department where I've taken classes has a Gesswein setup with footpedals and a Foredom tool for a drillpress, and it is loud, hard to control, vibrates like crazy, and is kind of scary to use, because the setup requires you to work sitting down on a bench. If your workpiece goes flying, there is nowhere for it to go but in your face, because the equipment is set up against a wall, and you are seated about eye to eye with the drill bit. Not fun. With my Dremel Rotary Tool Work Station, I was able to set it up on my large wooden workbench at standing height.  This is a much saner arrangement, and with safety glasses on, I feel entirely confident that I am in control of both the drill and the metal I am drilling into, even very small pieces.  I've noticed no shimmy or wandering of the drill bit.  It goes straight down exactly where I want it to go. I recommend this highly for all jewelers interested in drilling holes for eyelets, rivets, or cold connections of any kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4C0C3MHULN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00068P48O#wasThisHelpful","R2L4C0C3MHULN6","AWXXUOYG8Q8M3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWXXUOYG8Q8M3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you find yourself caught in maybe a lifetime of negative reactions to certain events, people, or addictive behaviors in certain situations?  Do you find it almost impossible to control yourself from reacting negatively to certain relatives, TV shows, or politicians?  Have you ever bought something just because you felt like it was something you should buy, or it was ""you,"" and then gotten it home and felt sick because you didn't need it or shouldn't have spent the money?  Who hasn't?  Pema Chodron's easy to understand discourse can help you get beyond these self-destructive behaviors in no time.  The freedom and peace that lies outside of living in reaction is your reward for listening to this teaching.  There is nothing here that will contradict any religious beliefs you may hold, but if more churches, for example, were teaching what she offers here in this simple and straightforward way, utterly without judgment, I think they would find their Sunday attendance would increase significantly.  Pema Chodron is entirely sympathetic to the human condition, and rather than condemn it, she helps us clearly identify the behaviors that keep us from living in lovingkindness and joy.  I recommend all her books and tapes highly, but if you can only get one to start with, start here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQPD4WI1NS4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590304349#wasThisHelpful","R1WQPD4WI1NS4O","AWXXUOYG8Q8M3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWXXUOYG8Q8M3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The hairdryer never gets too hot to set down, which means I can crank up the cord and put it away as soon as I'm done with it.

Cute, heart cut out metal zippers and pulls. The colors are fun and you'll know it's your bag in a sea of black luggage. I think this is sized for airlines overhead compartments, but I haven't tried to take it on board. Because it's hard-sided, you get a lot more interior space and your stuff is protected from damage. The interior lining is striped blue and white. It also has elastic straps to hold your clothes in place and a zip around flap to separate front from back. It's got a lot of bells and whistles for what it is, but ultimately, if you're choosing this bag it's because you want a hard-sided piece of overnight luggage and let's be honest, you like the colors: PINK!

"This is an item that looks a little fancier in the photos than it is in real life. I have the brown and blue and while it does resemble the picture, the finishes are hand made and you need to know that because it will have some imperfections. It even says, ""Hand made"" on the label. This is a plus to me. No two will be identical, but if you're looking for machine made perfection, this isn't it. It also says, ""Imperfections are natural"" on the label because that's a true statement. The woven cotton used will sometimes be imperfect and the color dyes may show a little bleed here and there - the floral design has been applied to just the top side of the cotton, there is no lining underneath. That's all part of having a hand made item and I think it's a bonus, but some people will not like that. I like hand made and if you do, too, you'll love it.

I used this in the small bedroom I'm sleeping in and within a day, there was a noticeable difference with considerably less fine dust in the air and no smell of the renovations.

"I hate killing, but I find the glues and poisons more inhumane than a good old mouse trap. Sometimes you have no choice but to kill when the little rodents are causing unsanitary and/or dangerous conditions with droppings around your kitchen and chewing on things, like live wires, that can catch fire. I prefer this version way more than the wooden mouse traps. This trap can be reused, if you can stomach having to clean it up. If the husband is home, I let him do this. If I catch one, I scoop it up with the shovel and throw the mouse with attached trap away in one fell swoop. I just can't try to retrieve the trap back. Squeamish! The bait on this works well and we've had no bait thieves escape, so far as we know. With it being plastic, I don't know about the longevity factor. Plastic will eventually crack.

"Usually, I like to have maybe 3-4 glasses of wine per week. As you can imagine, this winds up wasting a lot if I get a full size bottle and wind up having to pour out the wine that has gone bad. Often, I buy the tiny personal size bottles to avoid the waste, but with this pump, I can buy a full size bottle (much cheaper) and over the course of a week or two, I get to use the entire bottle of wine without the taste losing quality. It's very easy to use. You just put one of the stoppers into the bottle and place the pump on top. This works by pulling up, more than pumping downward. You'll know you've got the air out when it gets difficult to pump up or down. The less wine in the bottle, the more pumps it will take. I've not had it take more than 15-18 pumps, but there was not much wine in the bottle. With only one glass poured out, it only takes about 5 pumps or so. Beyond function, it's also a nice looking wine preserver. I was given another brand as a gift last year that wound up in the trash because it did not work and I wondered if any of them really work.

"I have used these for at least 10 years and I absolutely love the large planners, like this one. They are so easy to read and write on.

(I know people will say, ""There's an app for that."") There is something intensely satisfying about writing down a task, accomplishing it, then striking a line through it. I keep everything written down in here. Although, I should point out that I do not travel very much with mine.

"This does remove the humidity and since that is its primary job, it does it well. That being said, after owning 5 different brands of dehumidifiers over the last 8 years or so, I can say unequivocally, this is the LOUDEST one I've ever encountered. I would never dream of using this in the main living areas of the house. On low, it's not horrible, but crank it up to higher settings and you have to shout over it. We moved it to the garage and have had it running out there, but even the husband turns it to low because he doesn't like the racket. Also, I was a bit disappointed to feel heat being produced as a by-product. The air coming out of this was distinctly warmer than the air around it. The best dehumidifier I owned was one from about 2 years ago, which produced no heat and did a phenomenal job, but those were all recalled. Thus far, I haven't found another I like that isn't insanely noisy and produce heat, which is not a desired result.

While I cannot attribute the entire positive outcome to this product, since we've been actively removing sludge and contaminants, manually, I do think it has helped get the lake environment back in balance and we will continue to use it from time to time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8UM149KXROA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3YJ688#wasThisHelpful","R1T8UM149KXROA","A1OA2ZW406NQXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA2ZW406NQXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like that these supplements are in capsule-form. I really don't care for the kind that aren't coated and start dissolving before you swallow. With these capsules, you can swallow with a glass of water and never taste anything. The most desirable reason to choose these over some others is that these are not made in China. Personally, I do not care to ingest goods that are manufactured there, which is my prerogative and many others probably concur. I had no idea there was such a thing as genetically modified supplements, but since these claim to be non-GMO, I guess there must be some out there that are modified, but not these.

With ice and some water in the pitcher (there are measurement lines on the carafe), it comes out almost as dark as a pot of coffee, which is good, I need to stay awake. The flavor is great and this is so easy to operate, it's a cinch. After two pots, I had the process down pat. The carafe is thin and I'm scared to death of breaking it, but it's holding strong.

"Apple Watch adapters make all things possible fashion-wise with my Apple Watch and I appreciate that I can get these separately. These little stainless adapters allow me to buy nearly any watch band my heart desires and use it with my watch. This is just what I've been waiting for!The kit includes two adapters that match my stainless watch finish perfectly, two tiny screw drivers and four extra screws. Using these tools, my recommendation is to periodically check the screws and make sure they are tightened while using these adapters. This will help prevent them from working their way out and the surprise of having one of the adapters separate which could possibly put your watch at risk. I've found this helpful with bands I've bought that come with similar three piece adapters pre-installed.I have not yet had the opportunity to use these adapters, as of the writing of this review. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect watch band, but I will be sure to update my review after finding that band and putting these adapters through their paces.I was given a discount on this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A61SC6XEPMA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152VX9RC#wasThisHelpful","R1A61SC6XEPMA9","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This band is AMAZING! It's heavy, it's very well constructed, feels very luxe and fits my 42mm stainless Apple Watch perfectly.This band came packaged very nicely, with each section wrapped in plastic to assure there were no scratches during shipment. It includes a tool for removing the links at home (rather than at a jeweler) and a small screw driver to tighten the screws on the adapters (if needed). Installation was very easy and smooth with the adapters fitting flush with the watch.This is a very masculine watch band, it's heavy, shiny and perfect for any occasion where you need to dress up your Apple Watch.Something to note, while I was wearing this band, I did not experience any pulling of my arm hair. This is a huge deal to me, as many of the metal watch bands I've worn have resulted in very uncomfortable issues with the pulling of my arm hair.I really like this band and would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice stainless link band without shelling out hundreds of dollars.I was given a discount on this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RWQBPOG455C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017H4B5WS#wasThisHelpful","R4RWQBPOG455C","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this NAS for several months now and I'm amazed at all the negative reviews. I love this NAS and it's worked flawlessly for me. I have it hooked up to our network and use it to store and stream media files to my Plex server (located on a networked computer). I have had zero issues with the machine. The WD software interface works as intended and gives many options for configuration and management. Mounting the drives on both PC and Mac has been flawless. Administration is easy to do, even for someone like me that has no real IT experience.The iOS app makes it very convenient to access my files anywhere (hence the Cloud part of the device). I can upload/download to and manage my device as needed without needing to physically be home. I appreciate this as I‚Äôm often tweaking files and moving things around and now I don‚Äôt have to be tied to a physical location.Because I have two Western Digital storage devices (I also have a MyBook Duo 4tb) I can access and administer both directly from the app, or the website without skipping a beat. This is a feature I find very attractive as I know I‚Äôll be adding more NAS systems in the future and combining the administration in to one interface is much preferable to having to access multiple systems.All in all I‚Äôm very happy with this NAS. It serves its purpose of storing files, it‚Äôs easy to use no matter what your technical skill level is.

"These are some seriously nice headphones. I am not your typical gamer girl who would normally wear such a device, however these headphones provide such a lush experience when playing my games on my Mac computer I may have to wear them more often than not.My games of choice are typically simulation games. Games where I can do without sound as often as I have sound turned on. When I play with sound on I find that I don‚Äôt tend to hear a lot of the nuanced noises in games such as The Sims 4. With these headphones on, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm transported into the world I‚Äôm playing in.The sound is rich, full and very 3D. I now understand why headsets when gaming are so popular. It really pulls you in and helps with the immersion into the game.The controls are on the ear pieces, volume, lights, vibration. The microphone (which I didn‚Äôt use or test) is nestled into the left ear piece and pulls down very easily. I had no experience with the quality of the microphone as I don‚Äôt tend to play multiplayer games where communication is necessary.The ear pieces are nicely padded, they block out a lot of the ambient household noises, but not so much so that you can‚Äôt hear things happening around you. The entire head set is very comfortable and not heavy, so long sessions wearing it should not be uncomfortable.I like the added feature of the lights on the outside of the ear pieces. It‚Äôs a nice soft blue, not distracting, but adds a little flare to the set.This is a corded set. The cord is just over 7ft long, the plug end is USB using USB 2.0 technology.

"We have 10 of these bulbs in our house all controlled via our Smartthings Hub. Each bulb has to be paired and assigned a name, but after that process you can control them, via the hub, individually or as a group. I have many groupings set up for the bulbs with rules such as for all lights to come on at sunset at 50% brightness and turn off X number of hours later. The scenes are set based on how our family lives. For example, bedroom lights come on around the time we head to bed and turn off at the time we normally stop reading and are ready to sleep. My daughter's light in her room is based on her presence in the house. If the Smartthings senses she's in the geofence area it will turn on the light in her bedroom so she doesn't have to come home to a dark house late at night.

"This BRG Milanese Loop Apple Watch band is definitely not of the same caliber as the official band from Apple. However, neither is the price, which makes this band more attainable for folks not willing to shell out a large amount of money for one of the bands from Apple.I'm going to judge this band based on what it is, not based on the corresponding Apple Watch band. That said, this band is nice! It's very light weight, the solid one piece adapters fit nicely into my SS 42mm watch and the magnet is STRONG!When it's not on the wrist, the metal looks a little kinky, but I think that's because it's so thin. Once on it looks solid and feels solid. Because the adapters are one piece I don't feel like it's going to fall apart on me and I'm not worried about losing my watch. Most of my daily wear watch bands are of the sports band variety, with a few leather sprinkled in. This is the first metal band I have that I would wear on a daily basis. It makes a nice change and dresses up my watch when I need something a little fancier.

" 1:10 MinsIf you‚Äôre looking for some party lights, look no further than these Icicle Solar Powered Dragonfly LED lights. This string of lights is a multicolor 16 foot string with 20 dragonflies. It‚Äôs perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. Add a touch of color, some dancing lights‚Ä¶ whatever you choose as there are 8 different light modes you can program these lights for. All you have to do is press the mode button on the back of the solar panel and change to your favorite lighting pattern.The dragonflies are whimsical and fun, they remind me of spring and will make a nice addition to our party decor.The string of lights comes with a nice little plastic garden spike so you can get the solar panel placed securely in a position where it will absorb the daylight. If using inside, you'll want to either place near a window or put the solar box under a bright lamp to charge it up. There's a button on the battery box that allows you to turn off the lights as needed, but is not necessary for use after turning them on, as these lights will turn off when it's bright and on when it's dark. If you want to force them on when it‚Äôs light, you can simply flip the solar panel over so it‚Äôs not absorbing any light and these will then power on.The booklet that comes with the lights states the solar panel is fine in light rain, but may not last long in big storms. It doesn't mention extreme temperatures but I would guess the same would be true. If using these lights outside, I would recommend covering the panel if bad weather is predicted for your area when using this outside.

This is something I look for in headsets because I often will go quite some time between uses and there‚Äôs nothing worse than picking up an uncharged set of headphones and having to either find another pair or wait until they charge up.The sound output from these headphones is phenomenal! They get really loud and the quality is really full and robust. I‚Äôd say they even sound better than my PowerBeats 2.One really special feature of these headphones is the adjustability of the ear hooks. You can extend or retract the height, you can swivel and adjust the angle of the actual ear bud to fit your ears. No two ears are alike and this set addresses that issue really well.I highly recommend this set for anyone looking at wireless headphones.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZ1IPE89JDVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FHAOC8#wasThisHelpful","R1UZ1IPE89JDVQ","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:17 Mins This cute little cube speaker is great for those times you need a bluetooth speaker but don't need it to be loud enough to fill a large area. The cube is roughly the size of a Rubik's Cube toy.  The sound is full and rich from this tiny little package and its size makes it ideal for carrying with you for travel.The design features geometric cutouts that allow the led light show to show through. The lights appear to dance to the music you are listening to and they add a nice little ambiance when you are listening to music in a darkened room. There doesn't appear to be a way to turn the lights off, so if this is something that would bother you, take note.The power switch and buttons are all located on the bottom of  the cube. The buttons are hidden in the feet of the device and respond to both long and short presses to achieve the desired results. There are ports on the back side of the cube to allow for use of a TF (MicroSD) card and audio cable as well as a micro USB slot for charging the device.Out of the box this BestFire cube had enough charge to last me several hours of use. Pairing was very easy. There are voice prompts that let you know you are in bluetooth mode (vs. TF mode if a card is inserted) and my iPhone 6s Plus had no problems finding the device and connecting. The device shows up as Qnoe2 in the pairing menu. Once paired the cube reconnects with no delay when you power it back up.All in all I really like this little speaker. So much so that I'm going to wrap up writing this review and get back to listening to the ""Frozen"" sound track on it.I was given a discount on this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12O4ZIZVL2NZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WVBYL0#wasThisHelpful","R12O4ZIZVL2NZU","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you‚Äôre looking for some party lights, look no further than these Icicle Solar Powered Water Drop LED lights. This string of lights is a multicolor 16 foot string with 20 water drops. It‚Äôs perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. Add a touch of color, some dancing lights‚Ä¶ whatever you choose as there are 8 different light modes you can program these lights for. All you have to do is press the mode button on the back of the solar panel and change to your favorite lighting pattern.I love the detail and the sparkle of these lights. Each water drop has multiple bubbles captured within. They look almost alive and bubbling when light flows through them.The string of lights comes with a nice little plastic garden spike so you can get the solar panel placed securely in a position where it will absorb the daylight. If using inside, you'll want to either place near a window or put the solar box under a bright lamp to charge it up. There's a button on the battery box that allows you to turn off the lights as needed, but is not necessary for use after turning them on, as these lights will turn off when it's bright and on when it's dark. If you want to force them on when it‚Äôs light, you can simply flip the solar panel over so it‚Äôs not absorbing any light and these will then power on.The booklet that comes with the lights states the solar panel is fine in light rain, but may not last long in big storms. It doesn't mention extreme temperatures but I would guess the same would be true. If using these lights outside, I would recommend covering the panel if bad weather is predicted for your area when using this outside.

"This is it! I have finally found the perfect glass screen protector for my iPhone 6s Plus. Mic drop and I'm out...Well, not really. I do have a few things to share with you about this screen protector, but I'm not lying when I say that I am completely satisfied with this and it's the first time I can say this about any of the glass screen protectors I've tried over the last year (I had a professionally installed Zagg on my 6 Plus last year).The main reason I love this is because you can NOT tell you have a screen protector on your phone. Since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released last year, the glass protectors were completely obvious due to the design of the phone. The makers stop the glass just short of the curved edges of the phone to cut down on breakage. There really didn't appear to be any way to get a protector you didn't notice was there... until this one! The only things that give this screen protector away are 1. the home button is slightly recessed (as with any other glass protector) and there's a tiny extra circle cutout at the top to allow for the ambient light sensor (or is it the proximity sensor?)I'm not sure how KYASI does it, but by making a full screen protector that takes advantage of the design of the iPhone and replicates it they've managed to pull off edge to edge and invisible. I was pretty skeptical at first because the glass seemed like it'd have to be bulky and the white seemed a little cheesy, but it works. Once I got it installed (there's a video that gives you tips before you start) I showed it to my husband and he didn't even know what he was looking at. It's that good of a match. I put the phone in my case and the rest is history.I do want to note that I struggled a bit with installation. Getting the screen completely clean and dust free was a challenge. The whole process took me about an hour because I was so OCD with making sure there was no dust under the screen. Thankfully, the dust remover sticker was tabbed and easy to place under the partially installed screen to grab the stray dust particles as I was doing installation. After a bit of a struggle my installation was perfect. I'm not sure why this glass seemed to attract more dust than others I've installed, but in the end it was all good.This was the first glass screen protector I did not buy myself. I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I'm extremely glad that I accepted their offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZ1U9G1A7WOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EFSGDY#wasThisHelpful","RPZ1U9G1A7WOH","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LED desk lamp is pretty slick. It's got a small footprint, but sheds a decent amount of nice white light and has three brightness settings. It has a bendable neck and a swivel head so you can adjust the light direction as needed.What makes this little lamp so cool is that it charges via USB and features a rechargeable battery which ultimately makes it a wireless lamp!Plug it in, charge it up and then take it anywhere. You can use this at home, while camping or even have it handy when you lose power. Because it can be charged via USB you can charge it via backup battery packs, your car or other power sources in a pinch (such as a power outage.)I've actually placed this lamp on a little side table that is nowhere near a power outlet. It's a table that's needed a reading lamp but I was adverse to having a cord trailing across the room to reach that table. I never even thought of finding a rechargeable reading lamp until now. This lamp was a definite problem solver!I'm not sure how long the charge lasts, or what the battery is rated for. The listing really doesn't address the fact that this is a rechargeable lamp so I've got nothing to go on except actual usage. So far I've used the lamp for at least 2-3 hours and have not noticed any decrease in power. I'll make sure to update the review if I get more information on battery life or usage times.My only disappointment with the lamp is that there's no charging indicator. There's no way to know when it's fully charged so I just leave it plugged in for several hours before using it wirelessly and hope that's enough.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ERJ1AM36L7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3X692#wasThisHelpful","R29ERJ1AM36L7X","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found my new favorite iPhone Folio case! This case is adorably cute, slim and adds almost no bulk to my iPhone 6s Plus! It's extremely well made, the stitches are straight and clean. The denim color is even, not blotchy. The finishes are top notch which make this case feel very luxe.The denim material gives the case a nice hand grip, which I appreciate as I find the iPhone 6s Plus to be a bit unwieldy on its own. Because this case is a Folio style case you get the extra benefit of the screen being covered when not in use. One nice feature is the magnetic closure system. It's very unobtrusive and virtually unnoticeable but provides some great function. When the cover is in the closed position it, of course, does it's job to keep the case closed and stop the cover from flopping about. It's when the cover is in the open position and you fold it behind the phone that I really appreciate having the magnet as it holds the cover in the back as well. This causes the case to change form and feel more like your basic snap on case. I find that when I'm hanging out around the house I keep the cover folded back and the magnet keeps it in place. Other similar cases I've used did not include the magnet and it got annoying to me to constantly have the cover flap flopping around when I was using the phone.Another really nice feature of this case is the ability to use it as a stand. You simply pop the left side of the phone out of the holder and bend the back of the case a bit so the phone is resting on the open flap. It takes about a second, but makes it very useful for those times when you need a viewing stand.Beuno really put a lot of thought into the details of this case.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RC8G03ZSMJMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01537C2U0#wasThisHelpful","R2RC8G03ZSMJMF","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very unique Micro USB Cable. I was fascinated with the connections as they don't look like what you'd find on your typical cable. What I didn't expect was how cool the flat cord is. It's very bendable and can be positioned almost any way you can imagine. It doesn't get tangled and because it's flat you can easily hide it in little nooks and crannies that round cords may not slide into as easily.The only thing I would say to anyone buying this is to make sure you plug the USB end in completely. Because it's designed differently than most USB connectors you may think it's in all the way, but you may need to push it in a bit further. I ran into this the first time I used it and couldn't figure out why the device wasn't charging. A quick look at my USB hub and the connector and I realized it actually was not seated properly. After that, this cable worked like a beast and did the job of charging my devices quickly.I would recommend this cable for anyone looking for a fast, unique, and long Micro USB cable.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0BEDAXH1N3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ68L0E#wasThisHelpful","R3N0BEDAXH1N3E","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After ordering my Apple Watch last spring I had dreams of quickly amassing an amazing watch band collection. However, since then I've only purchased one additional Apple Sports Band (pink, in case you were wondering). I've been hesitant for a couple of reasons. The main one being cost. Most of the official Apple bands are bit pricey for me. The second reason I've held out is the lack of nice feminine looking bands in the 42mm size. I like big watches and I know I'm not alone in this, yet I feel like people making the bands think girls only buy the 38mm size. Well, I'm here to tell you they are WRONG! Make it and they will come... or at least I will.Enter this adorable Wearlizer 42mm leather watch band in turquoise! It is as cute as they come! The band is your basic leather strap but the color is what really makes it shine. It's unique for Apple Watch bands. The color is rich and vibrant. The leather is soft and feels very comfortable.That said, let me also share that the adapters on this band are pretty impressive. The stainless matches my Apple Watch nearly perfectly, the connections feel tight and sturdy, there's no wiggle in the adapter connection and very little gap between the band and the edges of the adapter.The sizing of this band is roomy. The individual pieces are just a little shorter than the large Apple Watch sport band pieces, yet the way the holes are cut it feels longer and seems to fit better.I also like the fact that there was a screen protector included in the box, along with a tiny screw driver to tighten the adapters if needed. Both are nice extra touches. The benefit of the screw driver is two-fold because you can also use it to dismantle the adapters and use them with any 24mm non-Apple Watch watch band of your chosing (22mm for the 38mm version). This opens up a whole world of watch band opportunity.Ultimately the sign of a good band for me is one that makes me happy while wearing it.  This band does just that. The price was right, the color was right, the feel is right. Not to mention, I can't even tell you the compliments I've received since I started wearing this band. It makes my watch stand out and people definitely take notice.Update 9/26: While I still love the color and feel of this band I must revise my review and drop my star rating from 5 to 3. Why? Well, after just a week, one of the adapters has already lost a screw and separated into two pieces. Thankfully I found this out before I lost my watch off my wrist. I'm terribly sad because this was quickly becoming my favorite watch band.Update 9/28: I recieved a very nice email from the seller of this band offering to send me a replacement. I will be sure to use the replacement and update this review in a few weeks. I'm definitely impressed with their customer service.Update 10/8: I recieved my replacement band and I've just started wearing it again. The first thing I did was tighten the screws with the included screw driver. I then placed a drop of super glue on each screw indentation. My hope is by taking these steps the screws on this new band will not come loose and fall out again. I will update my review in a few weeks after I see how this band holds up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174RWNK86ZC5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT93T8C#wasThisHelpful","R174RWNK86ZC5O","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Go big or go home! That's how I feel about this little Haweel 4 port car charger. I've already had a 2 port and thought that was enough, but after recieving this to test I realize I was limiting myself. With this car charger I can charge two phones and two tablets at the same time and not skip a beat. The top 2 ports are 1A which is sufficient to charge most phones including my iPhone 6 Plus. The bottom 2 ports are 2.4A which is perfect for charging an iPad (or two). The best thing about the 2.4A ports is that if you do have an iPhone 6 Plus and you plug it into one of those ports you'll get a faster charge which really comes in handy if you're like me and often leave the house a little low on the juice.Now, I will admit, on most days I don't NEED 4 ports of charging power in my car. However, there are times when I have a car full of passengers and we're all fighting over the charger. That's when this little gem really shines.  All you need is the right cable and four people can happily charge up. The rest of the time I'll probably use 2 ports (iPhone/iPad) and occassionally a third as I sometimes need to charge one of my other devices while on the road. It's really nice knowing I have the ability to do so.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXX5CYSL583X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z65KBVM#wasThisHelpful","RXX5CYSL583X5","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This micro USB cable is fast and cute. What more could a girl ask for? I really love the color. I've not gotten into buying cables in various shades, but since my collection of cables currently consists of black or white this little green gem stands out and makes me want more! The cable itself seems to be of a pretty sturdy build. I don't feel like it will kink easily which is a good thing because I hate replacing cables damaged by kinking.

"There's really never been a time when I said to myself ""Self, you need a selfie stick."" so when I recieved an offer to test one and then review it I was hesitant, but decided ""What the heck."" and accepted the offer. I am so glad I did! I never had any idea how much fun these little sticks could be. This selfie stick by Karnotech is a mini selfie stick so it fits nicely in my purse and can go everywhere with me without any issue. I don't use it to take selfies of myself, because I'm not really a selfie kind of girl, but I have been using it to take pictures and videos from perspectives I don't usally utalize and it's been giving me some really neat shots.One thing I loved about this selfie stick is that it's small and light enough for a four-year-old to use. I know this because I handed it to my four-year-old nephew with my iPhone 6 Plus firmly attached, showed him how to start and stop video by pushing the button on the handle and let him loose. He had a ball recording himself talking and even took a few shots making selfie faces (how'd he know to do that?). The videos he made we will cherish and be able to use to torture him with when he's older.This is a no-frills selfie stick. No worries about bluetooth connectivity. You just plug the cable into your headphone jack on your phone and use the button at the end of the handle to snap shots or activate/deactivate video recording. The stick can extend from roughly 5"" to a little more than 2'. It weighs barely nothing so if you do carry it with you it won't add much weight. This makes it the perfect accessory for anyone looking to use a selfie stick while out and about.The only issue I have with the Karnotech selfie stick is with using it with an iPhone 6 Plus. It's a pretty tight fit and at first I wasn't even sure it would work. I have my phone in just a clear snap-on case that doesn't add much to the size and it's a challenge to get it in and out of the clamp. Be prepared that If you use a bulky case it may not work.In the end, I'm very glad I tested this product. It's opened my eyes to why these devices have gained so much popularity these days. It's not just about taking the perfect selfie.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9744L3CK8ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012T4JBDQ#wasThisHelpful","R2A9744L3CK8ZP","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my Netgear Arlo 4 camera system for about six weeks at the writing of this post and I couldn't be more pleased. Prior to purchasing the $500 system I read many reviews, spent some time on the Netgear Arlo forums and almost talked myself out of trying these cameras. Thankfully I decided to go ahead and give them a shot.Over the past few years I have tried many different wifi cameras around my home. Until this summer my favorite was my DropCam Pro. It had a few drawbacks, the biggest being having to pay for cloud storage or not having any way to record or store footage taken by the cameras. The cloud cost was pretty large at $10 per month for the first camera and $5 per month for any additional cameras. This can add up fast and I wanted more than one camera in my house so this was a consideration when looking to purchase more DropCam Pros. After purchasing my DropCam Pro, Google acquired DropCam and then put the company under the Nest umbrella and a few months ago released the Nest Cam. The Nest Cam was to be the ""upgrade"" to the DropCam so I was all over it and ready to take the plunge. Unfortunately, after purchasing it I realized it was a downgrade from the DropCam Pro and wasn't the right camera for me. So I started looking at other options. That's when I found the Netgear Arlo system.Netgear Arlo is a completely wireless security camera solution. Each camera runs on 4 CR123 batteries which are rated with a lifespan of about 4-6 months. The cameras are indoor/outdoor and weatherproof.The batteries, and the ability to place these cameras virtually anywhere, were the main selling point for me. I love that I can have the cameras monitoring the front of my home, my back yard, rooms in my home or even the inside of my refrigerator should I so choose. This gives me flexibility to have the system grow and change with my needs. The Arlo system I purchased comes with 6 magnetic mounts which can be affixed to walls with the included screws and anchors. It also included one adjustable indoor/outdoor mount which we used to affix one of the cameras to the roof of our front porch. Inside I got creative with my mounting and am actually using 3M Command picture hanging strips to hold the magnetic mounts in place. This makes it easy to move the cameras and not destroy the walls. I eventually plan to pick up one of the Arlo table/ceiling/wall mounts to use as a table mount for one of the cameras.Since this system is completely wireless it includes a base station. The base station attaches to your router via Ethernet and it acts as the wireless network for up to 10 Arlo cameras.1GB of cloud storage is included with the cameras at no additional cost. This includes storage for 7 days and up to 5 cameras. Other packages are available if you need longer storage times and/or more cameras. The prices for the additional packages start at $99 a year. I have found the free package to be more than sufficient. If you need to save a recording longer than 7 days the option to download clips is available on the Arlo web portal and in the mobile apps.The Netgear Arlo system is not one where video will be constantly streaming. To save battery life the system is set to activate on motion detection and record for a determinate amount of time set by the user. You can also activate live video by choosing a camera feed, in the app, to view. Up to 4 cameras can be actively viewed at any one time. While viewing you can activate recording or snap a still photo.Motion detection levels and recording time can be individually set for each camera and can be controlled by various modes and rules set by the user. These can be as basic as ""All Motion On"" or ""All Motion Off"" to more complex configurations such as a rule I have that if my front door camera starts recording motion it also triggers my living room camera to record so we can see who might be entering the house from the front. The flexibility to control these different scenarios makes these cameras even more useful to me than I would have imagined.As I mentioned earlier, battery life is determined by use. I believe the 4-6 month life is based on recording of up to 4 minutes per day. I have one camera we set to 100% motion and within 2 days the battery level was depleted by a third as the camera went off if dust floated by. Changing the motion detection to a level of 75% extended the life of those batteries by 6 weeks and I have just now gotten the notice that they need to be replaced. At six weeks in I still have 2 cameras with full batteries and another that is down by a third. I keep tweaking the motion settings and recording lengths to get the best results from each camera as I see what is, or isn't, being captured.As of now there are no ""Smart Home"" features built into the Arlo system outside of the rules and modes provided by the Arlo's locked down apps. IFTTT integration and support is highly sought after on the Arlo forums as is the ability for other smart home applications. I found this lack of smart home features confusing as much of the reading I did on these cameras prior to purchase referred to it as Arlo Smart Home. Even their Twitter presence is @arlosmarthome. I can only hope this means that smart home features will be introduced in the future, though none are announced as of the writing of this review.The other feature this camera system lacks is the ability to record sound or communicate via 2-way audio. The other systems I've used have included this feature and while it's not something I use often, there are times I find myself wishing it was available.Regardless of the few shortcomings this system has, I am extremely pleased with how it works and the flexibility it brings to using cameras in the home. I look forward to seeing what changes Netgear has for this system down the road, but as it stands now it's doing the job I need it to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a camera system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86TU7GX0WSG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU7S4LG#wasThisHelpful","R86TU7GX0WSG4","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kiloline 2-in-1 Professional Hair Straightener And Curler seems like a great idea on the surface. Unfortunately it does not quite stand up to being a great straightener or a great curler. It does both things ""Ok"" but not spectacularly.First, I must say that I adore the color of this straightener. It's girly and yet not gaudy. I also love the temperature display on the top of the device. It's fun to watch the temperature change as it heats up and I appreciate being able to see exactly what the temperature is. I've never had a straightener that does this and I think this is a feature I will look for going forward.Now my thoughts on actual usage of the straightener/curler. As a straightener it gets nice and hot (up to 450Àö) and does a decent job straightening the hair. I use a straightener several times a week and I am quite picky. I have naturally thick, wavy and coarse hair and as a consequence I need a straightener that can hold its own against my locks. This one straightened my hair decently, but did not do a very nice job when it came to smoothing. I think it's because the plates don't get close enough together and grab on to the hair the way they should. If you don't hold the end of the straightener tightly it will quickly pop open and release the hair. I was trying to manipulate the way my hair was in the device and ended up just getting it pulled by the curling ridges. I've never ended up with so much hair left on my straightener as I did the first time I used this one.Speaking of the curling... those issues with the plates, not getting close enough together and wanting to pop open too easily, lent themselves to a tricky experience when trying to curl my hair. I was trying to use the straightener as a curling iron rather than as a curling wand. My hair was between the plates and as I would try to wrap it the plates would pop right open. I managed to get a few nice curls by contorting myself and carefully flipping the iron while using one hand to keep it clamped shut. However, it was such a pain to accomplish I gave up the fight and grabbed my standby curling iron to do the rest.There is a little lock on the end of straightener so you can lock the plates together and use it as a curling wand. If using this as a curling wand, I highly recommend using the heat glove included with the retail version of this device. (Disclaimer: mine was open box and did not include the glove,  I used my own.) It's very hot and it's easy to get your fingers singed by either your hair or the straightener when wrapping your hair in the ridges. Even with the glove, using this as a wand was not ideal. I had a hard time getting my hair tight enough to get a decent curl.My daughter also took a turn with the Kiloline Hair Straightener And Curler and had a very similar experience. She's in the market for a new straightener and was not impressed enough with this one to want to purchase one for herself. Her biggest complaint was that the ridges on the outside prevented the straightener from getting close enough to her scalp and didn't allow her to get the top of her head as straight as she likes it.Disclaimer... I was sent an open box item to test and review so that may be affecting the way my straightener worked and may be the reason it doesn't grip the hair tightly. It looks like it was never used, but there's always the chance that it was defective and that's why it was open box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVOGRX9PIK89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FOJA56#wasThisHelpful","R2JVOGRX9PIK89","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these vinyl chalkboard labels. They add a nice look to containers and dress them up a bit. This set comes with a chalk pen which dries nicely and resists smudges (if you let it dry all the way before applying to your container) and then can be wiped away with a moist towel. Because the labels are vinyl, and the chalk pen is erasable, you can reuse these labels over an over again.There were a few issues I encountered. The first issue is that the labels are a bit difficult to remove from the paper backing. When trying to remove them the backing tried to come up with the label so this caused a few smudged labels as I kept trying to get different parts of the edge to lift from the paper and allow me to peel it off. It's easier to write on the labels when flat, so I just had to be patient and let the chalk dry completely before trying to peel it off.The second issue I found was the container you use these labels on must have a flat spot larger than the label or you will end up with bubbles and wrinkles. This limits the size of the jar or container you can apply these to. You can see what happened when I applied the labels to various size jars in my images.All in all I'd buy these, but I would prefer a set that had various sized labels so that I could pretty up all of my containers, not just the large ones.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYVO4P6G3ENM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HN0FN6#wasThisHelpful","RQYVO4P6G3ENM","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this Crucial ram sitting in my cart for ages just waiting for the price to drop. I didn't think I really needed it at this point, but when the price dropped nearly half of what it was when I originally put it in my cart I decided I needed to jump on it. I'm so glad I did! I am using this ram in my 2013 27"" iMac and man does that machine fly now that it's running on 24gb. I mainly use my iMac for video encoding and Sims gaming. I felt that running on 8gb of ram my iMac was doing the job I needed it to do. I had no idea that adding the additional 16gb would make such a difference and be like giving my iMac a turbo boost. Processes complete faster, I notice less instantances of Finder crashing on me as I move between network connected drives and playing the Sims 4 and Sim City is nearly flawless.

"This little car charger does the job and does it quickly. On a recent road trip I had three of us in the car and we all had our iPhones with us. Great! I figured this would be the perfect time to put this little guy to the test. I already have a dual USB car charger that I use on a day to day basis. It has both a 1A and 2.4A slot. Since I use an iPhone 6 Plus I tend to keep it in the 2.4A slot because it's tedius charging with the 1A. This Mokos charger has TWO 2.4A slots. This means I don't have to worry about where I plug my phone in and also allows me to charge my iPad Air at the same time. What I didn't count on was how quickly this charger would charge regular sized iPhones. Both of my car-mates had iPhone 5s phones with them and this charger didn't miss a beat. The phones charged up quickly and retained that charge throughout the trip.While performance is the most important part of devices like this, at least for me, I also appreciate the whole package and only use devices that I find attractive. This definitely falls into that category. It's really pretty sleek and when in the charging port of my car it's snug and doesn't stand out or draw attention to itself. It's nice looking yet understated.Needless to say, I have retired my original car charger and will be using this one for now on.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RLBU8J0OX5FK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGVGACK#wasThisHelpful","R3RLBU8J0OX5FK","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am obsessed with this cable. Why? I mean, it's just a lightning cable. I have many of them and while I like some more than others I don't tend to obsess over any of them. Well, this one is different in how it's made and that's what makes the difference for me. Instead of using a plastic casing for the wires these cables are wrapped in braided nylon. This is a nice change because it means there is less likelyhood of the cable getting kinked and damaged which causes the traditional cables to stop working. The ends feel, and look, very well made and sturdy. The cable is also MFi certified which means it has been made to Apple's specifications so you can be assured that the technology in the cable will not damage your device if you use it. I always tend to prefer using MFi certified products with my Apple devices. So my obsession with this cable is for the whole package.

"WD Mybook Live DuoI have been running a WD My Book Live Duo 4tb Cloud Storage system for almost 2 years and I've been nothing but pleased with it. This NAS (network attached storage) hooks right into our network via Ethernet and we are able to access it via our computers and mobile devices wirelessly.The device has a decent web browser based dashboard for configuration but is limited in some of what you can do compared to more modern models, for example options are limited on how you are able to configure the hard drives. It's all pretty basic and designed for users at all technological levels. If you follow instructions it can be up and running with very little input on the users end.We don't use our My Book Live Duo set up in a RAID configuration, instead we use it strictly as a 4tb drive. The only option we had with this system was to configure both drives as one hard drive using span (instead of seeing each hard drive as an individual 2tb drive, the system sees both combined as one larger 4tb drive). I prefer the option to see each drive individually on the network so I can micro-manage what goes where, but this configuration has worked fine since the drive size is relatively small at only 4tb.The WD My Book Live Duo works with both Mac and Windows systems and comes already configured to run as a Time Machine backup drive for any Mac computers in your house. We use this and it works flawlessly. There's also another backup system in place called SmartWare that we have not tried but is designed to backup Windows systems.Local access across our home network works flawlessly in a mixed Mac/Windows operating system home. Mobile access to the My Book Live Duo is available via both Android and iOS devices using apps found in their respective app stores. The app also allows you to add access to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive and Mycloud.com which will give you more ways to expand your cloud storage and easily access it all in one place.Our system is used mostly for media storage and is configured so our PLEX server can pull media files from it as part of our whole home media solution. This works flawlessly. If you're not using PLEX or another media server you can still use this drive to serve media files, and allow streaming by enabling the DLNA media streaming or using the built in iTunes server, across your network.One feature the WD My Book Live Duo has is the ability to expand its storage by plugging in an additional USB hard drive. This makes it easy to add more space at any time. The only downside to this expansion is the speed is only USB 2 so it's not quite as fast as most newer USB hard drives are configured for today (USB 3). The speed will definitely play a factor when streaming media and will not mimic the speeds attained when accessingI originally bought this NAS on a whim because I found it on deep discount at Best Buy but it turned out to be a great addition to our network and made me take a second look at adding NAS drives to our home rather than throwing more hard drives into our media computer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TO2QRR8KLNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064XAJ5I#wasThisHelpful","R16TO2QRR8KLNN","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this Kash Technology lightning cable for a while now and I am quite pleased with it. It looks much like every other lightning cable with the exception of the Kash Techology logo printed on the USB end and the company's intials printed on the lightning end. I appreciate the fact that Kash Technology has not tried to just mimic the original Apple cables, but make their cable stand out. No confusion of which I'm using and it shows they're not pretending to be something they're not. The cable itself feels pretty substantial, the neck connections seem a bit firmer than the OEM which may help the inevitable kinking that happens with these cables over time.I've used this cable to charge both my iPhone and my iPad Air 2. It's worked flawlessly. Since it's MFi certified it uses Apple's technology and specs and should not throw any of the ""This Accessory May Not Be Supported"" errors you can see with non-MFi certified cables or charging devices.

"Soundpeats Q800I am usually not a fan of the necklace style bluetooth headsets that are quite the rage these days. I think I've seen too many people wandering around wearing them as a fashion accessory and it turned me off. My bias against them has kept me from buying any, or even investigating what they have to offer. Until the last few months. In that time I have been sent two pairs to try out and review and these Soundpeats Q800 headphones are one of the two. I am warming up to this style quite a bit.The Soundpeats Q800 feel well made, the plastic does not feel cheap or easily breakable. The buttons are placed very thoughtfully and lend themselves to easy memorization of function and the charging port is designed to be out of the way, yet very accessible. All of that said, none of this matters if the sound stinks. That's the most important part of a good pair of headphones. Thankfully, I can assure you that the sound on this headset is very good. I am not an audiophile so I can't give you specifics, but I can tell you that the sound eminating from this system is very pleasing to my ears and can get loud enough to make me happy even if I'm in a crowd. That final feature is one of my biggest complaints from other bluetooth headsets I own. If it can't get loud enough to be heard in a crowd I stop using them.Bluetooth pairing was simple and I easily paired these headphones with both my Macbook Pro, my Apple Watch and my iPhone. One thing to note, you will need to turn off the bluetooth of the first device these are paired with before pairing with a second device if the first device is within bluetooth range of the headset, otherwise they'll ignore your attempts to place into pairing mode. Once paired, they will re-connect with the last device they were connected to. You'll have to manually disconnect to switch devices. Not a huge thing, but something to note if you run into issues.Some of the other bluetooth headsets I've used have had issues with disconnecting from my devices. At this point I have not experienced a full disconnect, but I have noticed at times the connection feels as if it's breaking up. When this happens the connection issues tend to clear up fairly quickly on its own with no user input. I appreciate this as there's nothing worse than being on a walk and in the grove with your music when your bluetooth headphones disconnect and you have to get them up and running again.The battery life on these headphones is stellar so far. I've only charged once since recieving them and I have easily listened to about 8 hours of music. They are rated for 1o hours of music play and I have no doubt I will reach that time frame before having to charge again.All-in-all I really like these Soundpeats Q800 headphones, enough that they've now become my companion and are always nearby and ready to go when I need to grab a headset.I was sent this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27I1UNEAQ3YKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R27I1UNEAQ3YKG","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me it started with a miniseries on the Fox network. It ended up with my exploration of the Wayward Pines trilogy of books.

"Pines is not the kind of book I typically read. I'm more of a lighthearted romance modern Fiction reader. However, this summer I watched the 10 episode series of Wayward Pines on Fox network, swooned for Matt Dillon as Ethan Burke, was intrigued by the storyline and I wanted to know more about the people living in that idyllic town. Thankfully the Wayward Pines series is part of the Kindle Unlimited program and I was able to both get the audiobook and Kindle versions so that I could read and listen to the entire series using Whispersync. My family started with Pines (in audio format) on a cross country trip this summer and it was a little slow to get into, especially since we've been watching the first several episodes of the series, so we put it away thinking maybe the audiobook version wasn't a great choice for in-car listening. After our trip and and a few more episodes of the series I brought out my Kindle and started reading more of the first book. I am so glad that I did! The difference is between the book and the TV series are vast. I find, of course, the book to be more in depth and able to take the story farther. The nature of the Wayward Pines trilogy is that of many secrets, many layers and many questions that don't get answered until later times or as told through flashbacks. All of these things make a story such as this hard to translate to a 10 episode series on the small screen. If you watched Wayward Pines on TV, and enjoyed it, I encourage you to read these books. I think you'll like them even more than the series and an added benefit comes from having a vision of the characters as played by the actors in the series. Though I must wan you, there are some discrepancies in age and descriptions of characters from what we saw on the small screen. I won't go into detail of the differences, I don't want to spoil it for you, but I can assure you some of the differences had me asking ""What were the writers thinking?""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT48PDOQSBTOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FG9LIE#wasThisHelpful","RT48PDOQSBTOS","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second book in the Wayward Pines trilogy, is a continuation where the first book of the series leaves off. When reading the ending of the first Wayward Pines book it felt unfinished. This book picks up where the first book left off without missing a beat. It almost feels as if the two books should have just been one, not two separate books. If you've just finished reading the first book don't hesitate to continue on with the second and third as the characters become more developed, the story even more gripping, many questions answered and the twist and turns never seem to stop. I started with Wayward Pines thanks to the Fox network 10 episodes series that aired this summer. I was so intrigued with the story line, that I sought out the books and I'm glad that I did. Watching this series introduces you to the characters and the basic plot line, however this story is so twisty and turny that there's no way a 10 episode TV series could do this book series justice, so the storyline diverges a lot from the books to make it fit for network TV. I won't talk much about the plot of this book in this review, because I don't want to give anything away. However, if you're intrigued by the TV series I encourage you to read these books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORL3E3MITU5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1IPQZ8#wasThisHelpful","RORL3E3MITU5W","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this Petseer Bitter Apple spray to test and review and it could not have come at a better time. I have a cat that has decided she'd like to chew on my many cables and wires around the house. She does it just to be playful, everything is a toy for her, but all I can envision are the dollar signs that pop up as she chomps away. Decent cords are not cheap! Anyway, this spray is just what I needed! A little spritz on the cables and she won't go anywhere near them!

"The Logitech FabricSkin Keyboard Folio for iPad Air works with the iPad Air 2 after a little finagling.I was lucky enough to find the Logitech FabricSkin Keyboard Folio on deep discount at a local retailer last year. It was just about the time the iPad Air 2 came out ,and I had just upgraded, so I grabbed it. I then came home and read reviews and almost took it back because many reviewers stated the plastic connector near the power button had been breaking after light use. Thankfully I decided to hold on to it because it's been a fantastic case! After nine months the FabricSkin still looks like new. None of the plastic has broken, everything still works perfectly.There was one little bump in the road using this case with the iPad Air 2 which I had no yet read about... it did not work with the newest iPad. The magnet placement in the iPad Air 2 had changed from the original iPad Air causing the keyboard to not turn on automatically when the iPad is attached to the case's magnetic strip (this also eliminated the case being able to sleep/wake the iPad). With the iPad Air you just stand it up and attach to the case's magnetic strip (at the top of the keyboard) and the bluetooth turns on when the iPad's magnet connects with the auto-on magnet of the case. There's no on/off switch on this case so it's really dependent on the magnet connection working properly and telling the case to turn on the bluetooth connection. After doing some research, and discussing the issue with others having the same problems, it was discovered that an external magnet placed on the iPad could allow the iPad and the Logitech FabricSkin folio to  connect via bluetooth and communicate with each other. Now I just keep a tiny magnet Velcro-ed to my case and attach it to my iPad when I need to use the keyboard.I have the yellow/grey version of the Logitech FabricSkin folio and I absolutely love the color. It never fails to garner comments from those seeing it for the first time because it's not your usual black or grey keyboard case. The FabricSkin keyboard has me spoiled for any future keyboards. The keys have a great feel to them, soft and very smooth. The finger feel is something that's hard to explain, but I really enjoy using the keyboard because of it. The battery life is amazing. I do not use my keyboard all the time so I go about 4 or 5 months between charges.I'm just glad I figured out a solution to the magnet problem and was able to get my Logitech FabricSkin folio to work with my iPad Air 2. The little inconvenience is worth it to be able to use this as my daily iPad case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TH5UIE4M1PFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ9XHNE#wasThisHelpful","R3TH5UIE4M1PFQ","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Neewer Photo Studio light cube is just the thing I was looking for to help me take better photos of small items. This cube is 24""x24"" when opened yet folds up into a small little package for storage. When set up the light cube resembles one of the many foldable laundry baskets that are on the market. It's made out of a material that reminds me of a parachute and has rounded support edges. The front panel is open but has a lip which is about an inch wide. This lip is necessary to provide a space for various strips of velcro needed to hold the removable screen you put on the front to complete the cube when needing that diffused light. The removable screen has a slit built in so that when attached you can still put a camera lens inside and continue taking pictures. Included in the package are a storage bag and four different backdrops (red, white, black and blue).The material this light cube is made out of makes easy work of getting decent lighting on the items I'm trying to photograph. There is nearly no glare even in natural lighting. I bought the kit without included lights and have set mine up to use some LED lights I already had. I use three that can shine in from either side and/or the top/back depending on what kind of lighting I need. The material does a terrific job of diffusing the light.There are a few things to note about this light cube and the backdrops. When you first open it the entire cube is a wrinkled mess. I took a small iron to all 5 sides to smooth them out. Two of the panels have velcro on the interior so you can attach the backdrops. Smoothing those panels out actually seemed to help the backdrops lay a bit better, though they are not perfect and still show wrinkles depending on what I'm photographing. Speaking of the backdrops... these come folded into little squares. First thing out of the package they'll need to be ironed. Some people have commented that they washed and then ironed, but I just ironed and they smoothed out nicely.I have not tried to fold this up and put it away since I first started using it. I feel like this will be a challenge as it was a bit of a puzzle opening it up. My advice is to pay attention to how it's folded when you are opening it and try to recreate the folds when putting it away. Or you could do what I plan to do and that is NEVER fold it up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29V4TED587HHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKGGICC#wasThisHelpful","R29V4TED587HHL","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm going green... well at least more green than I've been when it comes to packing my lunch for work. Along with this lunch bag, I've also ordered a set of the LunchBlox and I'm ditching the ziplock bags I normally pack my lunch in. This bag is designed specifically for the LunchBlox system, but I think it could work for anyone. It's a nice compact bag, yet very roomy. I was able to fit lunch, a snack, an ice block and a 20oz bottle of soda inside and still had room to fill. My lunch is cold and ready for me when I'm ready for it. I like that the bag opens in the front and folds down so the food is easily accessible at lunch time. The fold down front flap has mesh storage compartments so I can keep a granola bar and protein bar tucked away for emergency hunger situations. They really thought things out well with this bag.Bottom line... nice and roomy and should work for pretty much anyone that needs to pack a lunch regardless of whether they use the Lunchblox system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17U1RUSMI6FHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078K40OC#wasThisHelpful","R17U1RUSMI6FHA","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the perfect combination of containers for someone who packs their lunch for school or work. I typically use whatever I have around the house, including ziplock baggies, but have decided to be a bit more green and start using reusable containers when I pack my lunch for work. These work perfectly! I can do a sandwich, snacks, a salad, pasta... whatever I decide to take I can create a combination with these containers that works and at the same time keep everything cold and fresh until it's time to eat.

"This is tiny, battery powered device designed to add bluetooth to other devices that do not have it built in. I was sent this device to review and give my honest feedback on it. This is that feedback... I like this device, it's tiny and delivers big punch. Recently I've purchased a new Roku TV for my office and as it's wall mounted, I've been using the built in speakers (they're not great). I liked the idea of being able to plug this device into my TV and output the sound to my bluetooth speaker (in this case a UEBoom). Installation was a cinch, I have a USB port and headphone out jack on the TV so the BrightPlay just plugs right into those ports. Note: If you plug into the USB port with the included cable you do not have to worry about the battery dying. You can also use this without USB cable but only get about 8 hours of use out of the built in battery before needing to charge.Pairing was easy, the BrightPlay goes into pairing mode as soon as you power it on, I just put my speaker into pairing mode and they found each other easily. Entire setup time was about 5 minutes from opening the box to hearing sound on my speaker.The sound quality is good. The volume levels are good, unlike the Brightech Double Play HD I also reviewed, this device did not require me to turn the volume up on my television just to get good volume levels.The only issue I had with the BrightPlay Live is that using this for TV sound there is a noticeable lag. The lag is slight, but enough to notice that the lips are not in sync. Since I view the TV so close to my desk it's distracting. I found this same issue with the Double Play HD. This is the only reason for my 4 star rating.Overall, I would still recommend purchasing this if you are going to use it for audio transmission only. I don't recommend it for transmitting from a television.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJYEJED714C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP9MYFM#wasThisHelpful","R3HJYEJED714C7","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ambient lighting at its best! First thing you'll notice when you order these lights is how nicely they come packed. Care is taken to assure that none of the bulbs break in transit. Once removed from their box this string is LONG and the bulbs are nicely spaced so that when hung the lighting is spread evenly. The distance between each bulb is about a foot (the entire string is 26' long) and each bulb base has a little hook built in so you can attach the bulbs to each other, or to other thin wires etc. if needed, when hanging or designing with them. The hooks make using this string of lights, in a more creative way, easier. The bulbs are very bright, but not blindingly so. They can be used inside or outside and daisy chained with other sets if you need a longer run. In my opinion these are great year round party lights, perfect for a deck or patio but just a perfect to string up inside when you need that extra little bit of festivity.I was provided these lights to test and leave my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1BEXA1LJEW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK4Z2M8#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1BEXA1LJEW0","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brightech has quickly become my favorite provider of lighting products. This is one of the latest lights I've been sent to test and give my honest review and they have done it again. This lamp is sleek, extremely easy to assemble and very sturdy. While the lamp is taller than I am, I was able to put it together and get it working in less than 5 minutes. That's always a huge bonus. I hate putting things together so the faster I can I do it, the more I appreciate it. That said, once I plugged this in and fired it up I was impressed with the flood of light. This lamp puts of enough light to fill my entire dining room with a nice natural color. It's not yellow or blue hued like many bulbs, it's a nice white light. The on/off and dimmer button is located on the middle section of the stem making it easily accessible. The button responds more to a light touch than to pushing pressure. A light feather of your finger on the button causes the light level to change or to cycle the lamp off. There are 4 levels of light so you can use it for ambient lighting if you're not looking for a full room light. I like this feature as I would tend to leave this on at a lower light level as just a way to keep the dark out of a room we're not really using. I would like to note, after leaving this on for hours there is no heat emitting from it. That's a major plus for me!If you're looking for a new floor lamp, I would definitely rate this as one to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17R0ZT7E0JD48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW2BMSA#wasThisHelpful","R17R0ZT7E0JD48","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most frustrating camera I have ever owned! The frustration comes in because this is such a nice unit. The form factor is attractive, the camera records very nice video, the air quality sensor and added features like the lullabies and night light make this a potentially great home camera/baby monitor. Yet despite all of this, this camera CAN NOT STAY ONLINE for more than 24 hours at a time. What good is it, if I have to unplug it every day and replug it in just to get it going again? When we went on vacation this camera was useless. It went offline and unplugging/replugging couldn't get it back. It needed to be re-set up with my iPhone which was across the country (set up is done via bluetooth). So my house sitter could do nothing and the camera was offline for the duration of our trip. Add to these issues the fact that Withings is now charging for their cloud recording (it was free beta when I bought the unit)  and my disappointment grows.If this camera worked reliably, the only complaint I would have would be that it's impossible to turn the camera off (ironic, I know) when you do not want it recording. Instead, your only option is to rotate the tan sleeve to cover the lens. I would also like to see IFTTT integration and the ability to do location based recording via Geofencing (like you used to be able to do with Dropcam).As it stands, this is a non-functioning camera and I can not recommend anyone purchase it based my own experience with it. I am giving it 2 stars (instead of 1) because of the good features of this unit.I will revise my review if things change in the future.Edit 7/17/15: I have been in contact with Withings customer support via email and after trying a few things we may have figured out the issue. First I tried moving it from one router to another to see if it'd stay online. No luck. Next we tried a new firmware. No luck. Lastly we've tried unplugging it from the included wall power brick and using an iPad power brick with a USB cable for power. So far I've managed to keep my unit online for over 24 hours. That's the longest I've gone in 2 months with this device. If the power is the issue, I have to wonder why Withings hasn't addressed these issues with all the negative reviews saying the same thing.Edit 7/20/15: Camera is still up. I've requested a replacement power source from Withings and will see if that exhibits the same issues.Edit 7/27/15: I received my new power supply and it was DOA. Back to using my own USB cable and power brick. Customer service had me order another power supply and send both bad ones back. I do have to comment on Withings customer service. The person I've been working with is fantastic and is always prompt to respond and have a solution to try.I have also adjusted my star rating to 3 because my camera is working and has stayed up since I stopped using the included power supply. I do not want to go higher than this due to the fact that the included power supply and replacement were both duds. I think this is a common issue with these cameras and should be addressed by Withings. I did suggest they consider going to the more common USB cable/Power Brick combo that other camera makers use these days (ie: Nest Cam)Edit 9/6/15: Third time's the charm. After an issue with Withings ordering of my replacement power supply I finally received a third one and after a week my camera is still up and running. Yay!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0BB7ODOPTH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNM0T4A#wasThisHelpful","R1R0BB7ODOPTH2","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the most gorgeous bulbs I've owned! I feel like I've stepped back in time when looking at these pieces of art. The filaments are so fine and delicate, the color of the glass is just ever so slightly amber, the glow these bulbs give off when lit is soft and flattering. I can't say enough nice things about them. Over the past few years we've transitioned our home to mostly LED bulbs, so had I not been offered these bulbs to review I would never have gotten to experience them. I'm so glad I have. These are the types of bulbs you want to use in a light fixture that will show them off, not one that will hide them. I like these bulbs so much, I'm actually looking for a new lamp or fixture that I can purchase to use them in.

"This lamp is sleek and very modern. It comes in 3 pieces and assembles in less than 5 minutes. Each of the three ""bulbs"" are adjustable which makes this lamp a great one to have for both lighting a bedroom or as accent lighting in a larger area. The lamp is less than 5' tall but takes up minimal space as it's very compact. The power cord includes a foot pedal that you use to turn this lamp on and off so keep that in mind when thinking of room placement as you'll need to be able to access it.

"This is a GORGEOUS lamp... once you get it all put together. I timed myself assembling it and it took exactly 1-hour! So be prepared for a project. The box this lamp ships in is relatively small compared to the finished project size. I've included a photo to show just how many pieces this lamp arrives in. The installation is tedious, but not difficult. I do recommend having a 2nd person help you assemble the tripod portion as it can be a bit tricky getting the legs screwed in. That said, this lamp is so pretty it is worth the time to assemble it. It does not come with a bulb, so be prepared with one upon completion. The cord is long and bright red. It's a nice fabric wrapped cord so it should never get tangled. There's a foot pedal to turn the light on and off so you'll want to make sure you take that into consideration when placing the lamp in your home.All-in-all I love this lamp and am glad I was asked to try it out and give my honest review of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUU489JTHON7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXJ4EXY#wasThisHelpful","R2XUU489JTHON7","A368Q44U8LKWNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A368Q44U8LKWNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although a very short work, the story does manage to flesh out the characters and interest readers.The only problem is the actual writing style.  For lack of a better way to describe it, it is very cold and flat.  It almost seems like what would happen if you took a foreign language novel and ran it through a canned translation program.

"If you read any my reviews of piano solo books, you know I am difficult to please.  This one is a winner from cover to cover.  James Koerts earned himself a place in my repertoire right next to Mark Hayes.  These are just beautiful.  The arrangement of ""Because He Lives"" in particular is worth the price of the book alone.  It is just.....wondrous.  Literally, it brought tears to my eyes as I played it the first time through.  And not just because there is one particularly difficult passage....This book is rated at Early Advanced and I would say that is perfectly correct.

"It is so difficult to find a good Lenten collection for an advanced pianist!I had high hopes for this collection, but was rather disappointed when I first played through.  The arrangements just are not at all to my tastes.  I much prefer the style of Mark Hayes or Mary McDonald.  For an advanced collection, this one just falls far short.  Most of the arrangements are way too loud and bangy for this quiet and reflective season.  ""Were You There"" was one I'd hoped to play for a large community Good Friday service, but it sounds so amateurish that there's no way I'd consider it.

"I had just finished the author's full length novel JUST A KISS AWAY when I saw this one available in the Kindle Lending Library.  Whenever I need a pick-me-up, from now on I will reach for a Jill Barnett novel.  Not only is the author an eloquent and masterful writer, she has a knack for writing delightfully funny stories packed with witty dialogue and downright comical characters.  But don't worry---there is still more than enough romance to make your Kindle screen fog up.This novella was funny from page 1 until the very end.  Trying to help her starving clan, Grace McNish plans to ambush a wagon caravan stuffed with supplies for the dastardly clann McNabb's Michaelmas celebration.  There will be enough food from that one heist to feed her people for months.  Leaping out of her hiding place from a tree---well, to be more accurate, I should say ""falling out of the tree""--Grace managed to knock out the biggest, most handsome McNabb she's ever seen.  The only trouble?  She doesn't know it, but he's no McNabb.Colin Campbell, the Earl of Argyll and Lord of the Isles, is one of the most powerful men in Scotland and has come to try to mediate between warring clans.  When a screaming banshee fell from above and knocked him off his horse, curiosity got the better of him.  Playing along with her game, he figures he can learn more about the McNish and McNabb fued by pretending to be her captive than by listening to clan leaders.  Something about the barefoot, mud-covered, beauty wrapped in a threadbare tartan tells him there's more to the McNish side of the story than he's been told.Grace's rag-tag band of reivers, accompanied by a piper so awful that she makes people cover their ears and just surrender, provide some absolutely side-splitting comic relief.  It was absolutely, positively entertaining all the way through.  My only disappointment---it ended.

"After mucking through several dreary, misery-laden historical romances in the last few weeks, this fun and quirky love story by Jill Barnett was just what I needed.  This author never disappoints me.  Her stories are always full of love, laughter, and passion, while never dark or dreary.  This one is no exception and is what I would classify as an endearingly romantic comedy and one that I could read over and over again.JUST A KIS AWAY‚Äôs heroine, Eulalie Grace LaRue, known as ‚ÄúLollie‚Äù by her friends, is probably one of the most hilarious and unforgettable characters I‚Äôve ever come across.  So naÔve and helpless that it‚Äôs funny, she gets into scrape after scrape because she honestly doesn‚Äôt know how to function outside of her protected Victorian world.  Throwing a woman like that into the thick of a jungle with murderous men on her heels is an unusual premise, for sure.  But instead of getting aggravated by her seemingly endless ditzi-ness, readers will come to love the pampered society lady that makes up for her real-world knowledge by ‚Äúspitting in the eye‚Äù of her situation and finding her inner courage and spunk.  I smiled and giggled the entire way through this book.  Well, I take that back; there were a few times I grinned and blushed instead.ÔÅäAnd the hero?  Sam Forester could‚Äôve stepped right from an Indiana Jones or Steven Segal movie script.  A rugged, muscular, one-eyed, mercenary soldier with a thirst for danger and a knack for escaping sticky situations, Sam is as opposite as one could get from the fluffly pink chiffon-encased Lollie.  To say they are worlds apart is an understatement.  But that‚Äôs what makes this book such a fun read.  It seems they both are in need of someone to rescue them after all.Following Sam and Lollie through the jungle on one harrowing adventure and Lollie-induced-disaster after another will keep you turning pages late into the night.  Add in a talking bird with a bad attitude and knack for saying awkward things and a few hairy tarantulas into the mix and you‚Äôll be wiping the tears of laughter out of your eyes.  I loved this book from the very first pages until the last.  Five stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7I5WSLOWK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QTP3KI#wasThisHelpful","R2J7I5WSLOWK5","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure this will gain me ""unhelpful"" votes, but I give honest reviews, regardless of the cost.  If ever there were a novella deserving of a below-3-star rating, this is it.Just save yourself the trouble and avoid the entire series.  It's poorly written, features a horribly spoiled heroine that is impossible to root for, and a confusing side-story that is left completely unresolved.I spent 90% of the book convinced that the ""hero"" was going to end up with Diana, the other woman.  All I can figure is that the laundraum the childish Vesta dosed him with left him with permanent brain damage.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPX91V1MH8CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXVX3NS#wasThisHelpful","R3JPX91V1MH8CW","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I downloaded this novel through the ""Kindle First"" offer.  Normally, I prefer historical romances but I like to read a contemporary one once in a while.  This one sort of reminded my why I only do that once in a while.A great deal of the time I spent reading this book I was confused.  I realize it is not the first in the series, but normally authors give more backstories for previously introduced categories.  It seemed like there was an awful lot that I was already expected to know.My other problem with this book?  Sometimes the heroine speaks in full Southern ""slang""---then suddenly she doesn't anymore for very long periods.  Is she a Southern gal or not?I agree with some of the other reviews posted here.  The book would've been better served to just deal with one bad guy.  Having a violently crazy soon-to-be ex-husband after the heroine and a sociopathic murderer after the hero was just too much for one book.Overall it was ok, but I won't search out the rest of this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFK3NWZ3EJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1Q55OK#wasThisHelpful","RFFK3NWZ3EJU","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading this novella, the first thing I did was go back to the Amazon listing and see exactly how it was classified.  It's not marked as such and not mentioned in the description, but this is what I would call a Christian Romance.  I neither seek those out nor avoid them---to each his own--I just want readers to be expecting that it is heavily laden with comments regarding this or that being God's will, with characters stopping to pray at slightly odd moments, etc.  It almost felt like the author took a ""regular"" romance novella and was asked to insert religious references after the fact.  They didn't really fit at times.The story is definately also of the ""sweet"" category, which is fine with me.  There's nothing more than a chaste kiss (well after they are married, even) and the veiled references to marital bliss in the epilogue.  So, if you don't like the graphic love scenes, this one is for you.A promising story line just never quite gets the chance to develop in this short novella.  Things happened outside of the story that really should have been explained (there's a hostage late in the story that made me think ""what?????"" and apparently something happens to the heroine's home, but we don't know what, why, or who did it)  There are plenty of kilts, however, so I'll forgive the author for the other lapses.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYWOP11D65KK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFDTJTY#wasThisHelpful","R2RYWOP11D65KK","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story has a great deal of promise.  Suspected of taking improper liberties with his childhood friend, Lindsey, Charles is tricked by her father and impressed into four (or other places in the book it says three....and others five) years in the Royal Navy.  Bent on revenge, he plots to marry Lindsey on his return and collect her dowry.Or at least at times that says that is the plan.  Other times, the reader is told that Charles only survives his time in brutal naval service by thinking of his true love, Lindsey, and trying to get back to her.Lindsey has always loved Charles.  But she hates him.  No, wait, scratch that--she loves him.Confused?  So was I while trying to make sense of this book.  There are leaps forward and backwards in the timeline that only add to the confusion.  At one point, the hero's middle name is even different.  It's just a jumble, that is for sure.Besides the confused story line (which seems like it was partially changed, but not completely), there are grammar and usage mistakes aplenty--furniture being covered with clothes instead of cloths, for example.As a free selection, this wasn't bad.  I would be hard pressed, however, to recommend it though.  There is much better fare out there.  However, with a good editing touch, this could be a very enjoyable story.  Let's hope a revision is available soon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW9A8KM01PWGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XDW9GE#wasThisHelpful","RW9A8KM01PWGI","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella was an enjoyable quick read--just what I needed to recover from the last book I read, which was quite depressing.  I found myself grinning at my Kindle while reading because I LOVED the hero's sarcastic, caustic humor.  When the handsome young physician opens his mouth, you never know if he will spout dry, gloomy medical advice or let loose a hilarious zinger.I hadn't read anything by this author before, at least not that I can remember.

"Everything I‚Äôve read by Cheryl Bolen has been a ‚Äúkeeper‚Äù and this latest in ‚ÄúThe Brides of Bath‚Äù series, LOVE IN THE LIBRARY is no different.  Readers of the previous four books in the series will love the glimpses of familiar characters, but each can be read and enjoyed as a stand-alone story as well.  If you wish to read them in order, they are:  1-THE BRIDE WORE BLUE, 2-WITH HIS RING, 3-THE BRIDE‚ÄôS SECRET, 4-TO TAKE THIS LORD, and finally 5- LOVE IN THE LIBRARY.Catherine Bexley finds herself enjoying her newly widowed status.  Although she never wished him to pass away, she does not find herself particularly devastated by the loss.  If only he had left behind enough money to maintain her home and keep food on her table, she would be perfectly happy to never marry again.  Unfortunately, the only thing of value he owned was a rare 400-year-old edition of ‚ÄúThe Canterbury Tales‚Äù‚Äîwhich has now mysteriously been stolen right out of her home.  As her eviction date approaches, she has two choices:  find the stolen manuscript and sell it, or marry the insufferable Mr. Longford, described in the book as a ‚Äúwalking soliloquy‚Äù because of his tendency to prattle on and on about his distant connection to royalty.  Catherine would do anything to avoid that!But who could help her track down the manuscript?  She would need to hire someone that not only had expertise in the area, but would be willing to keep the matter quiet, out of respect for her late husband‚Äôs reputation.  Hiring a Bow Street Runner was out of the question.  The last thing she wished to do was shout from the rooftops that he‚Äôd left her destitute and she desperately needed money.  That would only make Mr. Longmouth‚Ä¶.I mean Longford‚Ä¶.press his suit even more.Catherine finds the perfect partner in Melvin Steffington, who unlike his notoriously rakish twin brother is a quiet scholar studying classical literature.  As much as his wild twin is  a fixture in Bath society, Melvin tries to avoid the social whirl and is more content in a library than in an assembly room.  Besides his expertise, he would have the connections to gain access to private libraries and the ability to make inquiries amongst collectors without causing too much notice.  All in all he seems perfect for the job.  But first she must convince a man she‚Äôd never really met to drop everything and help her‚Ä¶Summoned to Widow Bexley‚Äôs home, Melvin Steffington didn‚Äôt have the faintest idea why he was there.  Not one to normally notice such things, he‚Äôs instantly aware of her beauty and thinks that if he WERE such a man to be interested in things‚Ä¶.well, in Mrs. Bexley‚Äôs case at least, he just might think she were interesting.  Never one to be able to resist tears, Melvin agrees to help the desperate lady recover the priceless book, even though he doesn‚Äôt have the faintest idea how to go about such a thing.  What has he got himself into?  He is no dashing hero, riding in on his white charger.  His twin brother is the baronet who sweeps women off their feet and saves the day.  He‚Äôs just Melvin, the second son trying to make his way in the world;  a man who up until this time had never even found himself alone with a woman.  How deucedly uncomfortable this might turn out to be!The two make a hilarious team‚Äîan Odd Couple of sorts‚Äîas they track down leads and race against time to find the Chaucer.  They meet many eccentric and enjoyable characters on their quest and are put in situations that range from drop-dead hilarious to ones in which they might JUST drop dead.  Their adventures will keep you turning the pages all night.  And when their relationship starts to change?  Then the beautiful love story will make you smile and fill your heart.  After all, sometimes the ‚Äúquiet‚Äù ones make the most tender lovers.I highly recommend it!  Start the series today!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLDQDVTY56HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G66K1YC#wasThisHelpful","R2BLDQDVTY56HU","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After hearing my friends talk about this for months and after seeing previews of the series to be released on Starz this summer, I finally gave in and read OUTLANDER.  I liked it at times, but didn't love it and would rate it a 3 1/2 star read (although I am rounding up to 4).  There was just too much emphasis on less than savory elements of the era, which in some scenes felt over-the top and unnecessary.I can see how it will make a wonderful television series, though.  It is truly epic and full of colorful characters.  And Jamie, when he's not being a sadistic creep, is quite dreamy.  There are several scenes though, that I will probably fast-foward through when the time comes.I'm still trying to decide whether to go on to book 2 or not.  This first in the series was very, very (I should say ""verra verra"") long and drawn out.  I think I will go read half a dozen more pleasant stories--you know, maybe about the Black Plague or the large-scale slaughter at Culloden--to help me recover first and THEN I'll decide.There are so many more Scottish romances out there that manage to capture the feel of the times as well as still present a pleasant story.  I much prefer those.  This book was well-written and packed full of history, but it had scenes I just didn't care for.  Some of them seemed just like unnecessary violence that didn't really further the story.  I won't detail some of them because I don't like to include spoilers in my reviews, but the one in particular where the heroine is punished by being ""beat within an inch of her life"" by Jamie was just more than I cared to read.  She could've been punished, but it didn't change the plot by having her beat senseless vs receiving 10 or so lashes.  To me, it seemed more for shock value than anything else.  If you can look past sadism, rape, and unnecessary violence, then yes, this is a good book.  I know many, many people have enjoyed it.  For me it was just a little unpleasant to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTRGW5WK3RJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2L1O#wasThisHelpful","R1HTRGW5WK3RJE","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cynthia Wright is one of my most favorite historical romance writers, so when I saw she was writing a new series with a connection to the Raveneaus I was excited and have been eagerly anticipating its debut ever since.  The main thing that sets this author's novels apart is her careful attention to historical detail and the enormous amount of research she does to be able to write in such a manner.  Besides being an avid romance reader, I am also a history buff.  I enjoy reading her novels that much more because of the meticulously crafted and vividly detailed settings, characters, and dialogue that she creates.  It adds a whole other layer of realism and depth to her tales.  Every time I read one I learn something new that fascinates me and I want to research further.  These are most definately not your grandma's dime store novels.But don't misunderstand me.  Smuggler's Moon is not a dry history book like you had to read for your freshman world history class.  It is a beautiful romance full of adventure, intrigue, humor, and a very healthy dose of steam.The story opens in Bath as a retired bookseller's family is enjoying life on their newly inherited country estate.  After years of pinching pennies and taking care of her eccentric family, Julia Faircloth is finally enjoying life.  The only shadow over her days is her father's growing addiction to gambling.  Stumbling upon his latest marker, Julia storms off to visit the odious man that would seem to be next in line to prey on her father's condition.Instead of finding a slimy card sharp well past his prime, Julia stumbles in the front door of Sebastian Trevarre's home to be greeted by a dangerous yet devastatingly handsome young lord.  She wants (and needs) to think of him as the revolting Lord Satan, the evil man who would take yet another slice of her father's quickly dwindling fortune, but to her dismay he brings about rather the opposite reaction from her traitorous body instead.Lord Sebastian, recently an officer in the Royal Navy, returned home to find his brother had lost most of the family fortune at the gaming tables in Bath.  In hopes of recovering some of the losses, he frequents the clubs to find those who took advantage of his brother.  When the beautiful yet bossy Julia stormed into his house demanding release from the marker clutched in her delicate hand he refused because after all, no one had afforded his brother that courtesy.  If he has any hope of recovering his property and retiring to the estate to breed horses, he needs every pound he can get--regardless of the cost to others.As circumstances change, Julia's mother sees Lord Sebastian as the key to solving their financial problems and betroths the youngest Faircloth daughter to the rogue.  More and more Julia is convinced that Sebastian is indeed very much Lord Satan, she is determined to save her naÔve sister from a fate worse than death (having to consummate a marriage with that beast of a man).  The only answer is to switches places and sacrifice herself to him instead.As the story progresses and the deception is revealed, you can just imagine Sebastian's fury.  They tricked him!  But maybe marrying the fiesty, meddling Julia instead of her quiet, obedient sister is what he really longed for in the first place.  If he can just keep the keen young woman that was now living with him at his Cornwall estate from figuring out his secret plans to recover his fortunate through reckless and illegal means, things just might be ok.The secondary characters in this book are just as wonderful as the hero and heroine.  You'll not come across many families more eccentric than Julia's and Sebastian has an estate full of useless servants that provide perpetual comic relief.  I also fell in love with Sebastian's friend and neighbor, Tristan,  a hero himself and likely to be featured later in the series.Of course, the best part for me was the appearance of Andre and Devon Raveneau (the couple from SILVER STORM) in this novel.  Andre Raveneau is dangerously delicious and my all-time favorite romance heros.  This extra glimpse into his life as he is comfortably settled with his true love Devon is just icing on the cake.  And to make things more interesting, there's a deep connection between Sebastian and his childhood idol Raveneau.  Add in a mysterious eye ring and a dash of intrigue and you have another great read that will keep readers up late at night turning pages.1798 Cornwall is almost a character itself given the depth of the author's descriptions.  A reader feels completely immersed in the days where smuggling was a necessary means of survival for entire towns and finishes the book feeling as if they've traveled there without ever leaving the couch.  I can't recommend this new novel---as well as all of the others written by Cynthia Wright--enough.  It is definitely a 5-star read that will stay on the keeper shelf!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BEKZSB222SG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHH7F84#wasThisHelpful","R3BEKZSB222SG9","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Hayes is THE go-to arranger for advanced piano sacred solos.  Everything he puts together is pure keyboard magic and will earn the performer rave reviews time and time again.  I love that his books truly are advanced and let you ""be all you can be.""When I saw the song list for this book I was a little worried that I might already have these arrangements from other books.  Guess what?  These are all NEW arrangements, completely 100% different than any prior ones done by Hayes.  Each one is so different than anything else I already have.In Hayes' comments on the inside cover he says:  ""Back in the '70s, I remember the music of the ""Jesus movement,"" which was a rebellion of sorts against the status  quo of church music.  This movement featured folk and rock music with amplifiers, guitars, and drums and had a big impact on contemporary Christian music.  It was the beginning of what we now call praise and worship music.""  ""Enough time has passed that a compilation of praise and worship music is apropos.  I have arranged these songs before, so this time around I've tried to give each melody a new ""set of clothes"" musically.  People born in the '90s or later may not know these songs, so this is a perfect opportunity to introduce these pieces to a new audience.""And that is exactly what he's done.  He has taken ""old"" worship songs and made them sound new again.Songs in this book include:GREAT IS THE LORD - I love this arrangement.  Until this one, I have never been able to find one that really sounds advanced.  Most of the time this song is arranged rather ""bangy and clangy"" as my piano teacher used to call it.  This is energetic but not overpowering.  Love it, love it, love it.  I would rate this particular song at early advanced.  4 or 5 times through will have it ready for performance.(Approx time 2:15)HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME - Another winner.  I have an earlier arrangement by Hayes of this same song but love this new ""freshened up"" version.  My teenage daughter said it sounds much more modern and she loves it.  The piece starts in a syncopated fashion that's really different---but in a good way.(Approx time 2:30)THY WORD - moderately slow, rather peaceful and flows nicely. I think I will use this for an offering piece.  I also have an earlier arrangement by Hayes of this tune, but again think I prefer this new one.  There are a few more arpeggios in this one, but it is still easily brought to performance level in less than one week of casual practice.  (Approx time 3:15)ISN'T HE - I wasn't familiar with this song but really like it.  It is nicely arranged and very melodic.  There are more of the signature Hayes runs in this one, but they fall nicely under the hands.  (Approx time 3:15)AS THE DEER - a really wonderful arrangement.  It begins with an introduction in a minor key that flows beautifully into the body of the tune.  Very well done and very original.  The transition passages that Hayes inserts between verses are just beautiful and original.  It gets a little ""hairy"" when it modulates into 5 flats, but still flows well. (Approx time 3:15)HOLY GROUND - This one will get them tapping their toes out in the pews.  There's a one page introduction, that in true Hayes fashion could almost stand alone as a separate piece.  When it hits the actual first verse it kicks it up a notch and gets a little more peppy.  Then the second verse is a stately, octaved one that will really drive it home.  (Approx time 3:15)SPIRIT SONG - Very pretty.  Another winner.  More difficult at times, but still nothing that can't be learned quickly by an advanced pianist.  I didn't have any arrangement that I liked of this worship tune, so I was glad to find this one.  (Approx time 3:45)I LOVE YOU, LORD - Oh this one is beautiful!  This is another song that has been arranged ""to death"" by everyone under the sun, but this one by Hayes manages to sound like a brand new song.  I love it and I know the congregation will to.  (Approx time 3:00)THERE IS A REDEEMER - Nice arrangement with a verse in chorded octaves.  I wasn't familiar with this one but do like it.  (Approx time 3:30)SHINE, JESUS, SHINE - One of the best in the book for me, simply because there are so few good takes on this song that were previously available.  This is a great arrangement that actually sounds advanced and manages to work in the rhythm sound that you miss when you don't have the luxury of playing with a percussionist.  I can't wait to pull this one out for a prelude on a day that I need to wake people up....or as a postlude to get them out there door with a song in their heart.  (Approx time 3:45)MAJESTY - A song you probably already have 3 or 4 different arrangements of in your library.  This one really is wonderful, however.  Once again, Hayes manages to take a song that I was almost tired of and make it feel all new again.  (Approx time 3:45)BIND US TOGETHER - This is a great arrangement.  It starts in 3/4 time and has a flowing, almost waltzy feel to it.  It will have people humming along for sure.  This is another one that would be great for an offering piece.  Of all of the arrangements in the book this one is probably the least difficult, but it doesn't need to be complicated.  It is perfection just as it is.  (Approx time 3:00)Several of the pieces end with optional ""transitions"" that enable you to flow directly into the next song in the book without skipping a beat.  That's great for services where you need to provide 15-20 minutes of gathering music, etc.All in all, I am thrilled with this book.  There isn't a single dud in the entire collection.  Every single one will immediately go into my service rotation, starting with this Sunday!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39I46KG1EAK9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739064207#wasThisHelpful","R39I46KG1EAK9M","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This entire book is arranged by Matt Hyzer and is in more of an Intermediate to Late Intermediate range although classified as Advanced.  Mark Hayes it is not, but it is full of pleasing arrangement that are fun and relatively easy to play.  I've added a few images that should help give an idea of the difficulty level.Contents IncludeBridge Over Troubled Water  (3 flats) - This is actually one of the better arrangements I've come across of this song.  It's not overly cluttered and captures the spirit of the Paul Simon classic.If You Don't Know Me By Now - (Key of C, 6/8 time) - I wasn't as impressed with this one, simply because at times the rhythms seemed akward and out of place.How Deep Is Your Love (3 flats)- Considering the arranger had a Bee Gees song to work with, it's not half bad.  :)Killing Me Softly With HIs Song (Key of C) - This one killed me with boredom, but it's not really the arranger's fault.Moondance (Key of C - with a little swing) - This Van Morrison tune is one my all-time favorites and I was anxious to see how it would be arranged.  It's really not too bad.  It's simpler than I'd have liked, but captures the song well.Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head  (1 sharp) - Ok, I admit it.  I didn't even try this one.  I have a Mark Hayes arrangement of this that I love and I am positive all others would pale in comparison.  It looks very simple, though and probably just fine.Sunshine On My Shoulders (2 flats) - This one is the whole reason I purchased the book, so I am glad that the arrangement did not disappoint.  At times the harmonies are just a little bit off, but I just modified them a little to sound more like the original John Denver classic.Weekend in New England (Key of C  with a modulation into 5 flats that doesn't quite make sense) - Ok arrangement, not very difficult at all except for the sudden key change.Time In a Bottle (1 flat then goes to 2 sharps---then one flat, then 3 flats.  Yes, constant key changes for no apparent reason) - Music to fall asleep by.What a Fool Believe (2 sharps) - Eh, ok.Very few books are full of winners from cover to cover.  This one has at least 2 or 3 that are worth the price of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKDR47XPGGJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EB71NM#wasThisHelpful","RWKDR47XPGGJJ","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it.  The first few chapters of this book had me slightly confused and thinking ""OH THIS IS DEPRESSING!""  I am not a fan of misery-laden book.  Life is that way enough--I don't want to spend my free time READING about it.  I almost gave up on this book.  I'm so glad I didn't.True, it is full of heartbreak, violence, and a whole lot of bad things happening to a whole lot of good people.  But out of that heartbreak comes a beautiful story of true love, forgiveness, and new beginnings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ED9D5KUMA78S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NN2C4E#wasThisHelpful","R3ED9D5KUMA78S","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel was almost two separate stories.  It begins full of political intrigue, murder, and danger.....then it suddenly mellows into a luke-warm love story......then the last few pages wrap up the initial conflicts.  Kind of odd, really---but still enjoyable.  I give it more a 3 1/2 star rating than a 4, but I'm rounding up.Yvette is a very wealthy young woman fleeing for her life.  Ewan is Highland laird (who also is in service to the crown as an intelligence officer) that is tasked with protecting her and uncovering a dastardly plot full of spies, murder, and treason.  Caught in a compromising postiion, the two pretend to be betrothed as they travel to a safer place.Then they pretend to be married.  One problem--if you say you are wed in front of witness in Scotland, ye be wed.Ewan is thinking it's not such a bad thing---now he has to convince Yvette.  And keep her safe.  Yvette wants no marriage without a declaration of love.  Otherwise, how does she know the man loves her and not her inheritance?I did like this story, but I was confused now and then.  First Ewan is a proper peer of the realm....then he is a brogue-spouting Highland laird with massive relatives in plaids.  Which is he?  He's almost like two separate characters mashed awkwardly into one.  Not that I have a problem with Highlanders.....I much prefer Ewan the Scot.  Yvette is hard to root for at times, but ultimately she grows on you.  Over all, this is an enjoyable read, however perplexing at times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZW9L73VAMU3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CW1TTIO#wasThisHelpful","RZW9L73VAMU3B","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cheryl Bolen has a talent for making even the most tortured and broken man an irresistible hero.  George, the Earl of Sedgewick, is no exception.  We get to know George in the earlier books in this series and see him happily married.  But then the unthinkable happens:  his beloved wife dies in childbirth.Blaming the newborn for killing his beloved, George separates himself from his young son and wants nothing to do with him.  He focuses on his daughter, who is the splitting image of her mother and a source of comfort.  But not much comfort is to be had for the devastated lord, and he leaves his country manor and heads to Bath to drink and debauch himself into oblivion.Worried about her brother, George's meddling sister suggests it is time for him to take another wife.  If not for him, he should at least think of the children.  And she just so happens to have the perfect suggestion:  Sally Spencer, a life-long friend, and someone who is already attached to his adorable little offspring.  Rather plain and lanky, Miss Spencer doesn't have any other real prospects except for an odious old man that her brother wished to shackle her to for money.  What would she have to lose?  After all, it could be a marriage in name only.  More like an acquisition of a step mother for his children than the addition of a wife.Sally is floored by George's offer.  Since the first moment Sally laid eyes on him years ago she had been in love with the handsome brother of her friend.  But he never noticed her---and married another.  She felt bad begrudging him his happiness when he started a family and moved on---without her.  Then she lamented seeing him destroy himself after his wife's death.  Never one to mince words, Sally told George exactly what she thought about the way he was wasting his life.  But the moment he offered to ""sacrifice"" himself in order to gain someone to care for his children, she thought he might be actually open to the idea of welcoming his young son into his life.  If she could just try.....it would be worth living with and loving a man that didn't love her back.But as she takes control of his household and his children, George begins to see there may be more to ""Sensible Sally"" than he first though.  Even her tall, thin frame and straight-as-straw hair begins to grow on him....This is a wonderful book and a great addition to the series.  Yes, bad things happen.  Characters must overcome much to finally find their way to true love.  But isn't love worth it?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BCT9W6LSKPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005R3LZ90#wasThisHelpful","R8BCT9W6LSKPY","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BRIDE'S SECRET is yet another truly captivating, beautiful tale from Cheryl Bolen, one of my favorite historical romance writers.  Although it is the third book in the Brides of Bath series, it could stand nicely on its own--but reading the preceeding books first will greatly enhance the overall story.I have thoroughly enjoyed the series so far and could not wait to read the story that gave the beautiful and scandelous widow Carlotta her long-overdue chance at finding true love.Her love for her husband barely had had time to grow when he was killed in the Pennisula because of another's negligence.  Then years later, true love was exactly what Mrs. Carlotta Ennis had thought she found in the handsome and rakish Gregory Blankenship.  But time passed with no offer of marriage and it became clear to everyone in the ton that she was simply his mistress and nothing more.  When he left her to wed another, Carlotta was devestated.  With her widow's settlement long gone and the loss of Gregory's protection, she soon found herself in dire financial straights.Then, just as the storm clouds were darkest, a rainbow appeared (as the author so beautifully puts it) in the form of James Moore, who served with her late husband and had recently become an earl and gained the title of Lord Rutledge.Compelled by guilt and duty, James had traveled to Bath to do what he could to see that Captain Ennis' widow and young son were properly taken care of.  After all, it was the least he could do for the woman he had deprived of a husband, and for the young boy that would now grow up fatherless.  For you see, it was his mistake that had caused the brave soldier his life.Carlotta knows exactly who James Moore is and wants nothing to do with him.  Had he not disobeyed an order, her Stephen would still be alive and her life would be very different than the bleak one she now faced, alone.  The last thing she wants is help from him, no matter how sincere and heartfelt his intentions.But Carlotta's situation is quickly becoming desperate and she realizes that the earl may be the key to having the means to be reuinited with her young son, and she did need money, after all.  And it WAS his fault her husband was dead.  So why not take him up on his offer?But feelings never seem to work the way one plans, and Carlotta finds herself drawn to the man she should despise.  But if he ever learned her dark secret, he would want nothing to do with her.This is a beautiful story, full of lovely lines from poetry of the times.  At times it is sad (I'd give it a 3-tissue rating), at other times joyful, but always wonderful.  I think this is my favorite of the series so far.  Most definately this book is recommended for anyone who believes in the healing power of forgiveness and love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB5RLAQEYJ1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00538EDLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XB5RLAQEYJ1Q","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I would put some confusing looking slang in my review title since half of this book is in some sort of odd ""cant"" dialogue that doesn't make any sense to me and seems out of place in the setting.That's my first problem with the book.  The second is the crude love scenes that don't really add to the storyline.  There didn't seem to be any emotional journey with the two characters.  They met.  They argued.  They ended up in bed.  Then suddenly they are madly in love.I expect more than that from a historical romance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABPRJTP7Y97E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FKBCOM#wasThisHelpful","R3ABPRJTP7Y97E","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE THEFT BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a wonderful ""special"" addition to Cheryl Bolen's The Regent Mysteries Series.  I love when authors write in a Christmas novella into an established series.  It gives a chance for readers to see existing, familiar couples experience the joy and love of their first holiday together as well as a naturally romantic setting to help a secondary couple find true love.  That's just the case in this wonderfully written little treasure from one of the Jewels of Historical Romance.In the last few days before Christmas, Lady Daphne and her husband Captain Jack Dryden, are making preparations to head to her family's estate in the company of two very good friends, Miss Charlotte Huntington and Colonel Hugh Bond.  At the very last minute, the pair of super spies are summoned once again by the Prince Regent to handle a matter of utmost importance and secrecy.  Unable to explain to Miss Huntington their temporary diversion, Daphne and Jack send Charlotte away on an errand and then quickly slip away to meet with the monarch.The invitation to join Lady Daphne's family for Christmas arrived via a most unusual messenger---an unfamiliar yet lovely young woman Colonel Bond quickly noticed was not accompanied by a chaperone.  When he was able to recover from the shock of the unexpected visitor, he quickly returned to the decorum expected of an officer and once packed for the trip, escorted the young lady back to the Dryden's home.  When they find it still empty, they sit to uncomfortably wait for their friends' return.  When the hour becomes late they decide to go and look for the pair, despite the fact that it is ""most improper"" to be in a carriage together without a chaperone.One of my favorite passages in the novella is when, faced with this situation, Charlotte says ""If Captain Dryden vouches for you, I know you're a worthy man.""  To which Colonel Bond replies ""I vow to protect your person--as well as your virtue--with my life.""Ahhhhh.  No one talks like that anymore.  Men rarely vocalize vows to protect anything anymore--person or virtue.  That is what makes reading historical romances so magical.Of course, as the two spend time with each other while Jack and Daphne are off trying to locate a stolen statue that threatens to jeopardize England's fragile relationship and alliance with Spain, they begin to have feelings for one another.  When the time comes to take actions of their own to protect their country and monarch, the eagerly join together into the fray.As with all of the books in The Regent Mysteries, the romance is very sweet---not graphic or gratuitous.  These books are about half mystery and half romance, which combines to a book wholly worth reading.  Having read the previous two books in the series will give readers greater understanding of relationships and the dastardly yet unnamed villain in this book, but THE THEFT BEFORE CHRISTMAS is also capable of standing on its own as a delightful holiday read.Give yourself a little early holiday gift and download today!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P66VQ8ONVPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F86N1WA#wasThisHelpful","R9P66VQ8ONVPF","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE LADY AND THE COWBOY has a very promising story line, a likeable heroine, a heart throb hero, and interesting secondary characters as well.  It just needs a lot of polish to be a truly great read.At times the dialogue and story are short and choppy--almost like it was an outline or just thoughts thrown down on paper that were intended to be fleshed out more lately.  There are no transitional words, not much descriptive text, and it is very strange to read.  Then other times, the dialogue and story flows very well.  It was perplexing.The worst for me, however, are the love scenes.  Ewwwwww.  Very poorly done.  You might has well have been reading from one of those old health department pamphlets on the mechanics of the body, because it actually might have been less painful to wade through.  I'm not talking about them being graphic---I'm talking about them sounding clinical and very, very unromantic.  Love scenes should be about the emotions, the feelings, and the character's thoughts more than the mechanics of this goes here, that goes there.  It was almost like ""step 1, step 2, step 3.""After the first one or two of these love scenes, I was ready to toss the book aside, but thankfully the story line was just engaging enough that I had to continue so I could find out the answer to they mystery.So my suggestion?  Skip over the love scenes and you'll be relatively pleased with an original storyline.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NURASYYS4SAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEZL1QC#wasThisHelpful","R2NURASYYS4SAX","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The locket itself is very nice, and is exactly as described.  Our problem was with the chain.  It arrived just in time for my daughter's Sweet Sixteen birthday party, but when we went to put it around her neck, the chain snapped in two--and not even at the clasp, it was halfway down the chain.  Very odd!Amazon has a great return policy, however, so I immediately went on line and requested a replacement.  The new one arrived a few days later.  Too late for the party unfortunately, but at least she has it.  She still hasn't tried to wear it, though, because she's so scared the chain will break again.

"After I downloaded this book, I realized it was a ""first by author.""  Those can sometimes be bad news--especially when offered as a free selection.  It's sometimes akin to having a label attached, saying, ""WARNING, maybe be a waste of time.""  I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case with SEDUCING THE LAIRD.Cairn, newly named laird of the McPherson clan, is still struggling to gain acceptance from his people when he is taken captive by the evil English Lord Gundy.  A brave escape from Gundy's dungeons by the laird is actually a carefully orchestrated plot to plant a spy in his midst--a beautiful spy that ""saved"" Cairn and therefore became trusted enough to earn a place in the laird's life and castle.  Once within the fortress walls, Verena was to search for a hidden treasure and to dispatch the young laird once it had been found.But, of course, as a reader should be able to see coming a mile away--they fall in love, resulting in Verena being torn between completing her mission and her feelings for Cairn.The plot was interesting and fresh enough that it kept me turning pages long into the evening.  A female spy in the 1500s?  Fascinating.  A lethal one?  Even more intriguing and definately not standard historical romance fare.My first problem was that I couldn't help but giggle over a Scottish hero named Cairn.  A cairn is a man-made pile or monument of stones, often used as a burial markers.  Cairn is described as massive, so maybe he was so named because of his resemblance to said rock pile?  Or maybe his head was full of rocks?  HA!The characters were sufficiently developed, although a little more effort on the secondary characters could've added another layer of depth to the story.  I hope that a second book would focus on Cairn's French brother, who was developed just enough to be interesting, but not well enough to satisfy a reader's curiosity.  What sort of woman will finally be HIS match?  And keeping track of the various villans was at times tedious, but not so bad that it distracted from the storyline.Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It was a good, quick trip into 1500s Scotland.  The only thing missing was a good kilt....","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L74CE16BFGYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WCL87A#wasThisHelpful","R1L74CE16BFGYU","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my goodness--what a book!  I have been eagerly awaiting this book's release more than any other, ever.  I have other books that are my stand-alone favorites, but The Mackenzies Series is positively, hands down, my all-time favorite series from Ian's story in Book 1 to this concluding one.  Each one has been just.....wow.  There are no words.  The Wicked Deeds of Daniel Mackenzie wraps up the series in a most wickedly fabulous way.Well, what would we expect but for Daniel, the son of Cameron Mackenzie to be a wicked, wicked man?  How could he not be, considering his unconventional upbringing in a family full of scandalous men?  Each of the Mackenzies played a role in turning Daniel into the man in this novel.  Fortunately, not only did he learn rake-like behavior from his family, he also inherited the best qualities of each of the Mackenzie men.  He is keenly intelligent like his Uncle Ian, gifted in the art of love like his Uncle Mac, and confident and ruthless (if need be) like his Uncle Hart.  Daniel is all of them rolled into a young, delictible morsel of a man wrapped in plaid.And oh, the plaid.  As in all of the Mackenzies Series books, the kilt almost become a character.  I love kilts.  I love manly men wearing kilts.  <Sigh>When Daniel meets spiritualist Violet Bastien, he immediately sees through her tricks and props but is intrigued.  Not only is she beautiful, but she is clever.  Her talent with building machinery and use of complicated engineering principles to enhance her mother's seances make her nearly irrisistible to him.  No calculating society miss is Violet and Daniel can't wait to see her again.  But she vanishes!Violet has spent her life moving from place to place, taking care of her clarvoyant mother.  Her past is tragic and horrible and best, and has made her wary of men and reluctant to let anyone know the real Violet.  But there is something about the handsome Scotsman that shows up in the middle of the night for a reading.  He seems to see through her eyes into her very soul.This is a wonderful, wonderful story of two damaged souls learning to trust and to love for the first time.  In true Jennifer Ashley form, there is some serious steam between the characters.  Her love scenes always are.......heartstopping.....to put it mildly.  Her heroes have a way with women and know it.  If only they were real!!!!!!Highly recommended----start with The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie and prepare to be glued to your Kindle through the entire series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMMFL44U5P84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDQ3BIS#wasThisHelpful","RXMMFL44U5P84","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never have I seen a more appropriately titled novel.I enjoy campy, silly books, but this one really wore at my patience.  First of all, the premise is....well, ridiculous.Millicent Boarder takes on the persona of her deceased, miserly uncle, Mr. North in order to keep her mother and sisters from having to return to the work house.  Mr. first question--besides the obvious age difference that's never addressed, were there absolutely no acquaintences of the dearly departed Mr. North that might notice that he suddenly was younger and much more feminine looking?Then there's the personality change.  The true Mr. North was a mean, miserly, old man.  Suddenly the tenants are visited by a young, pleasant landlord that is willing to work with them????  Had NONE of his tenants ever met him before?The worst, though is the friendship that is struck up with a duke and his sister.  We are to believe that the duke spends and entire year (YES AN ENTIRE YEAR THIS STORY DRAGS ON) in close personal contact with his best friend ""Mr. North"" and never suspects?AND THEN....they fall in love?Oh goodness.

"I had already read 4 of the 5 stories in this collection yet still felt compelled to purchase it because they are so....unforgettable.This collection is filled with 5-star, full-length novels that are each completely different--yet carry the theme of having a hero that is truly an ""unforgettable"" knight.  These are men most swoon-worthy, to be sure.Getting 5 in one collection is a true bargain!  Warning, though---don't begin to read this collection until you have several days to read uninterrupted as they are all impossible to put down!THE MACKINNON'S BRIDEIan Mackinnon is not a man to be crossed. When his young son is captured and used by the English as a political pawn by the evil FitzSimon, , the fierce Scottish chieftain will not rest until he is safely returned. He has already borne so much, having a wife who chose to throw herself to her death out the tower window shortly after birthing their young son, rather than to ever suffer his touch again. Young Malcolm is all he has and he will get him back at all costs.The perfect means to that end presents itself when he and his men happen upon FitzSimon's daughter alone and unprotected. Surely her father will barter one for the other, because what man would not do everything in his power to protect his kin? The MacKinnon did not know that the English lord to not care whether his daughter lived or died. ""Good riddance,"" was his response in a nutshell.Page FitzSimon is furious that the savage Scots that now hold her captive appear to have gone back on their word to her father and do not trade her as planned. Although she is pleased that the quiet young boy that she had befriended in her father's castle seems to be happy for the reunion with his clan, she wants her opportunity to go home as well. The Scots are barbarians and their leader is the worst of the worst!She resorts to all sorts of crazy plans to attempt to escape, but to no avail. The MacKinnon, reluctant to tell the lass of her father's treachery finds himself drawn to protect Page, infuriating as she might be. But at the same time, he needs to focus on finding the traitor within his clan that handed his son over to the enemy. Along the way Page too begins to wonder if she isn't better off with the dangerous-looking chieftain. After all, he showed her more kindness in a few days than she had ever received in a lifetime with her uncaring sire.This story is a beautiful one, bittersweet at times, passionate at others. It draws you into the action, makes you laugh at times at the witty dialogue, fully vests you into the characters , and keeps you on the edge of your couch. You couldn't ask for a better start to a wonderful seriesTHE BEAUTY BRIDEI can't find the review I wrote for this one initially so I can't paste it in here--but I do remember that I LOVED the story.  Auctioned by her brother to help keep their family's estate, Lady Madeline is thrust into an unwanted marriage to an outlaw.  But there is much to discover beneath his scarred surface.A WHISPER OF ROSEMARYColeen Gleason's A WHISPER OF ROSEMARY is an enjoyable read for fans of medieval romances. True to the period, historical romances set in medieval times are often dark and full of extreme hardships and bleak circumstances. This is no exception. It is not for the faint of heart. There is tragedy, there is loss, there are serial murders most gruesome. But in the midst of all of that grows a beautiful love story.Lady Maris is the heir to her father's estate but to protect her holdings she ""needs"" a husband and her father thinks she is long overdue in choosing one. Because of her wealthy holdings, she is desired by many--unscrupulous and otherwise. Her father has chosen her betrothed (who's rotten), another equally vile man desires her and will stop at nothing to have her, and then there is the unknown humble knight that nearly runs her over outside the gates. That's three too many interested parties to suit the lady's taste.On a mission for the king to find a serial killer, Dirik has to hide his true identity as he travels to Maris' father's holdings. He needs to stay focused on his mission and cannot be distracted by the beautiful lady healer.  So much evil surrounds the lovers---will they be able to overcome it and find true happiness together?MY WARRIORThe Knights of de Ware series is absolutely wonderful and this 2nd book is my favorite of the three. MY WARRIOR is the story of the middle brother, Holden, renowned for his skill in battle. No one has ever defeated the mighty knight. As part of King Edwards contingent in Scotland, Holden finds himself the lord of a castle. When he sends some of his knights to ensure the safety of the laird of Gavin, a neighboring holding, things go terribly wrong and the laird ends up slain. Instead of peace, Holden receives the wrath of the new laird...the beautiful and fierce Cambria.daughter and heir of the Gavin.Cambira vows to avenge her death and can't wait to slay the Englishman whose treachery is responsible. Sir Holden de Ware, the Wolfe, is not the noble savior of her clan as her father had expected. He was a liar and man of no honor. She goes to challenge him and ends up his prisoner. Of course, she escapes. Then he ends up her prisoner. Then she is once again his....it almost is comical to watch them fight with each other, ignoring their growing passion.To forge peace and to save her clan and their lands, Cambria ends up entering into an arrangement with the Englishman that changes everything. Will they ever be able to work together or will they kill each other trying?I loved this book. The author creates characters that are unforgettable. The men are chivalrous and full of honor and the women are fearless and strong. You'll find no sniveling debutantes or prancing dandies in one of her stories. But you will find a bride that wears chain mail to her own wedding. :)THE DEVIL OF KILMARTINI cannot say enough good things about this book.There is romance and steam enough to fog up your reading glasses, for sure, but there is intrigue, mystery, and magical mysteries that will keep you turning pages or clicking the ""next"" button your Kindles as fast as you can.Named ""The Devil"" because of a madness that overtakes him, Symon finds a mystical healer named Elena in the forest as she is desperately trying to escape a brute of a warrior that has been chasing her. Taking her under his protection, he brings her back to his clan with the hopes that she can heal his madness and help him lift a curse. Elena has other ideas, however. She has just fled one warrior who wished to use her gift for his own goals and has no desire to now do the same for another. Even if he is kind. Even if he is compassionate. Even if he makes her feel safe and protected for the first time in her life.As are all of Lauren Wittig's stories, this is a great read, rich in imagery and a true sense of the era.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9S3NGMJD52A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUHQ2Y2#wasThisHelpful","RM9S3NGMJD52A","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First in a series, SEEKING PERSEPHONE is a sort of Beauty and the Beast tale.  It's a very enjoyable read, although it could use little tweaks here and there to make it an even better one.  Don't give up on it, though---the second in the series is FANTASTIC and you really need to read this one first to lay the groundwork.The dangerous and powerful Duke of Kielder is feared and respected by all.  Not even the prince gets a bow from the man---he gets the prince to bow to HIM.  Duke since the age of 8, Adam has put fear in the hearts of those around him in an effort to keep them distant, and thereby keep him safe from their pity and stares at his scarred and disfigured face.  Reminded that without an heir his vast holdings will pass to an idiotic cousin, Adam follows the advice of his solicitor and contracts to marry the oldest daughter of a nearly destitute nobleman.  Once he gets an heir, he can put her out of sight and out of mind.  The last thing he wants is a wife who is afraid to look at him or even worse, repulsed by what she sees.Persephone is puzzled why a powerful duke would seek her hand in marriage without even meeting her first.  Even more puzzling is the fact that he won't even look at her or even attempt to exercise any husbandly rights.  She wants a real marriage--not one in name only--and tries to break down the barriers to her husband's heart.  Can she heal him?  Can they ever find true love?Here's where my problems with this book begin.  His sole purpose for the marriage is to quickly get an heir.  Well, how do you get an heir?  You and your wife have to at least ATTEMPT to consumate the marriage.  He is focused on getting an heir, but doesn't even kiss her until halfway through the book??  And they never, ever...well, you know.  She is thrilled that by the end of the story he finally looks at her with love in his eyes.  But still---no heir.  Heck, even in book two of the series there is STILL no heir but at least they seem to be making progress.Also, the character of the duke just seems cruel and unloveable for most of this story.  I LOVE him in the second novel.  If only we saw more of his good side in this first one it would be easier to root for the couple.My other problem?  My goodness--I paid $10.49 for this book and didn't even realize it.  That is WAY too much for a short historical novel.  I had downloaded the second as a free selection and read it first, but then felt I needed to go get this one to better understand Adam and Persephone's relationship.  I downloaded it straight from my Kindle and didn't even see the price when I bought it at the end of the sample passage.  Oops.  Oh well--but buyer beware.  This book (nor the second one, despite how much I loved it) is not worth $10.49.  Not by a long shot.  It would be more appropriately priced in the $2.99 range.  I would wait until it goes free or on sale again.  Most definately do not pay full price!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZUF4SYQ4UV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JU5SQM#wasThisHelpful","R22ZUF4SYQ4UV8","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"COURTING MISS LANCASTER is one hilarious historical romance.I loved this book from the opening sentence to the very last page.  Although I enjoyed the supporting best-friend character of Harry Windover in the first novel, SEEKING PERSEPHONE, he truly makes an even better hero.The only friend of the fabulously wealthy and powerful ""Dangerous Duke""of Kielder, Harry jokingly suggests that he act as the duke's ""suitor sorter"" to relieve the man of the hated task of helping his sister-in-law and ward find a husband on the marriage mart.  Little does the duke know that Harry is already in love with the lovely Athena himself.  Knowing that the duke hates fortune hunters, though, the penniless Harry understands that his own suit would never be welcome.  How can he sit back and watch the love of his life be courted by others?Athena doesn't know what she wants in a husband and Harry works to help her ""eliminate"" characteristics one by one by introducing her to less-than-desirable examples of each.  One gentleman has a fascination with trees.  Another is more concerned with the cut of his coat than the kindness of his words.  One ridiculous encounter after another quickly helps Athena know exactly what type of many she DOESN'T want to marry, but puts her no closer to finding a match.All the while, she relies on her friend Harry to comfort her, be there for her, to cheer her, and to brighten her days.  She is so thankful he is her friend.  Or maybe there's more to their relationship?Readers get more of the delightfully rude and powerful Duke of Kielder in this novel.  He's much more fun in this book than in the first.  I love how potential suitors scatter when he approaches and how he makes them quake in their boots just with a glance.  In fact, this entire novel is better because there are no dark clouds over any of the characters---it's just a delightful romp through the ton as a young lady you doesn't even realize she is being courted by a friend finds true love.I wish there were more in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V00FKR53M12K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EOCET2#wasThisHelpful","R3V00FKR53M12K","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mackenzies Series is one of my top 5 all-time favorites.  Each and every book is so wonderful, so exciting, so......Mackenzie.  If you love kilts and the Highland men that wear them, this is definately a must-read series for you.Although this novella could stand alone, it would be best to start at the beginning of the series, with The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie.  Each book builds on the last, which I love because once you fall in love with a Mackenzie man, you don't want  him to ever go away!  Each plays a part in every single installment.The Untamed Mackenzie focuses on the half-brother of the Mackenzie men and previously unrecognized bastard son of the old duke.  Older than Hart, Lloyd Fellows would've been the heir had he only been born on the right side of the blanket.  Instead, he grew up in poverty raised my his tavern-maid mother.  Not one to wallow in his circumstances, he became a constable and quickly raised through the ranks to Chief Inspector.  He is thorough and becomes obsessed with each case until it is solved and the bad guys are behind bars.  That would be HIS madness (every one of the Mackenzies has an obsession/madness).Lady Louisa Scranton has always been a little fascinated by Inspector Fellows.  In fact, they'd shared two unforgettable kisses during their acquaintence.  Even though he is well below her station, she can't seem to get the handsome man out of her mind.  But she knows she should be looking for a respected, noble husband to repair her family name so she tries to ignore the pull towards the working class Lloyd.  When she finds herself accused of murdering a would-be suitor, she and Inspector Fellows are once again thrown together as he tries to prove her innocence and keep her from the hangman's noose.But can Lloyd focus on the evidence and solve the crime?  Or will he be constantly distracted by the lovely Louisa--the woman he loves with all his heart but knows he can never have?  Can Louisa resist the man whose touch burns her like fire and settle for a future with another man that leaves her cold?This is another fantastic read.  I've read the entire series several times through over the last few years because I enjoy them so much!!  Download them today!  And read them quickly so you are ready for the next one, The Wicked Deeds of Daniel Mackenzie, that comes out in October!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWCU2YHNI4FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEDDSMA#wasThisHelpful","R1SWCU2YHNI4FC","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A MOST DISCRETE INQUIRY continues the story of the newly engaged and soon-to-be wed beloved couple of the bespeckled Lady Daphne and the ""sublime"" Captain Jack Dryden from the author's first book in this series, WITH HIS LADY'S ASSISTANCE.  Readers are treated to the rare opportunity to continue to follow a hero and heroine through their first days of married life, which of course never go according to plan.Lady Daphne is far from ordinary, so why should her married life be?  On their way to the wedding breakfast, the new bride and groom are stopped by members of the Regent's guard and Captain Jack Dryden is whisked away to another top secret mission in the service of the Crown.  Wellington himself has requested his help tracking down a list of traitors to the crown before it falls into French hands.  There is never a day's rest for England's Greatest Spy.  Does his sleuthing wife pine away awaiting his return?  Hardly.  She begins investigating a mystery of her own.Daphne's duchess sister had been receiving blackmail demands from someone who threatened to expose her clandestine affair and secret love letters to a major recently killed in the Peninsula.  Desperate to end the matter before her husband the duke found out, she runs to enlist the help of her clever older sister.  Soon, however, the clever Daphne and her super spy husband begin to suspect that they are both looking for the same villain.  When they team up, traitors should beware!This story is a delight to read and is different from your typical novel of this genre.  I would classify this one as 75% mystery and intrigue, 25% romance.  It also has wonderful moments full of humor--a cook that can't cook, and a wedding night that is delayed more times than my Southwest Airlines flight home.I can't wait for another installment in this series!Cheryl Bolen writes exceptional stories full of carefully researched details and is just as adept at crafting a mystery as she is a beautiful, sweeping epic romance.  She truly has written just about something for everyone and has a permanent spot on my keeper shelf.  Once you read one of her novels, you will find you won't stop until you have downloaded her entire list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y6NHIV9BTPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00927UQGK#wasThisHelpful","R10Y6NHIV9BTPW","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WITH HIS LADY'S ASSISTANCE is yet another enjoyable read by author Cheryl Bolen.  First in The Regent Mysteries series this novel will leave you quickly clicking on the download for book 2 as soon as you hit the end.Captain Jack Dryden is puzzled to be called from duty in the Peninsula for an important audience with the Prince Regent himself.  What could the powerful man want with a lowly captain, a poor 2nd son of a country squire?  Well the humble captain just happened to be one of Britain's most valuable spies--and the Regent has a mission for him of the upmost importance and secrecy.  There had been two assassination attempts on the monarch and the Life Guard had been unable to discover who was behind them.  Jack had been recommended by his commanding officer as just the man for the job.  The only problem?  The Captain was not a member of the ton, so how could he manage to move unobtrusively through the London set and conduct a proper investigation?The answer was named Lady Daphne Chalmers.  No one was more connected or knew more about the members of the ton than the plain yet favorite daughter of the earl of Sidworth.  Although a skinny, nearsighted, bushy-haired fashion disaster past her prime, Daphne was friend and confidant to most of the London elite because of her kind heart and warm personality.  She was never short on conversation or dance partners, but was decidedly lacking in suitors.  But that was ok, because the bright bluestocking much preferred books to men.  Her keen intelligence and social standing combined to make her the perfect partner for Captain Dryden.But as Daphne poses as the fianc√© of the captain (given the humorously fictitious identity of a wealthy South African diamond miner named ""Mr. Rich""), she comes to see him as more than a tall, muscular display of magnificent manhood.  Underneath his stodgy, serious, duty-driven exterior lies a man more noble than any aristocrat.  At the same time, Jack begins to see the inner beauty that lies behind Daphne's spectacles and underneath her bird nest hair.  If only he held a title and would be considered worthy of her by her snob of a father.  A mere 2nd son of a farmer, no matter how distinguished his service in the Dragoons, would never be good enough for the precious daughter of an earl.  As their feelings grow, the impossibility of the situation becomes painfully obvious...but can it keep them from falling in love along the way?  And will it distract them from their mission at hand?  The Regent and all of England are counting on them to catch the would-be assassin!This book is delightfully laced with humor and suspense--with a good, healthy dose of romance along the way.  It's lighthearted, a little ornery at times, and honestly has some laugh out loud moments.  Not every historical romance has to be steeped in seriousness and tragedy--tearing the lovers apart and throwing the reader into fits of tears.  Sometimes you want to read something fun.  Something entertaining.  Something that makes you smile.  This series by Cheryl Bolen perfectly fits that bill.  The best indication of how much I enjoyed this book?  That would be the fact that I immediately picked up the 2nd in the series and kept right on reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLKLCLXSAVC03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006301DS4#wasThisHelpful","RLKLCLXSAVC03","A2RVSTOLBNDR5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVSTOLBNDR5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great book.  I'm not much for Western Romances, but I found this one to be so sweetly done that it will be added to my favorite list.Thrown onto the auction block to settle her cousin's debts, Maggie Monroe is pretty certain things could not be more bleak.  Just when it looks like she will be sold to a horrible looking drunkard, a dangerous looking mountain man steps in and bids an outlandisly high price.

"This is a great novella, just right to read while sitting waiting on soccer practice or on your lunch hour.  The author manages to pack a lot of fun and romance into such a short little piece.Luring the man she has loved since childhood to her family's home for Christmas seems like a good idea.

"Tags: FBI, Heroine: 33/34, Hero: 35-39, Ex-Military, Hero is Divorced, Heroine is DivorcedThis series just keeps getting better with each book. Clay wasn‚Äôt as outgoing or approachable as Jake and Tuck. He was jaded, had serious trust issues with women and thought most women were manipulative. A little background in the previous book revealed that Clay had once been married then divorced, but it had left scars. He was jaded and thought most women were manipulative. With good reason.Zoe was‚Ä¶wow. I loved her. After her own failed divorce, she really took life by the horns and made it bend to her will. I couldn‚Äôt always picture the 30-something, former lawyer turned romantic horror author as a Goth girl, but her personality was just so positive all the time. She wasn‚Äôt one of those heroines who closed herself off from future relationships because of one disaster. I couldn‚Äôt help but be drawn in by her.The romance was a notch above the first two books. Zoe was incredibly intuitive in regards to Clay. She was bold about what she wanted. I think her frankness stunned him a little, but it also made him feel more at ease and gave him the chance to realize she was nothing like his ex-wife. Her profession and preferred genre gave her a wicked hot sensuality that Clay could match. Their sex scenes were so hot! And I definitely shared her fantasy of ‚Äúsuit porn‚Äù.The suspense was chilling. Zoe faced the situation with so much bravery; I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to muster the same testicular fortitude as she did. And considering Clay used to be a Navy SEAL, I LOVED that the water rescue scene. There‚Äôs nothing hotter than the image of a warrior in full gear rising silently out of the water to save his woman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZ0J5WP3RQJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTRD9T4#wasThisHelpful","RAZ0J5WP3RQJ3","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tags: Romantic Suspense, FBI, Heroine: 29, Hero: 31, Interracial/Multicultural, Friends to LoversThis was a great follow-up to the first book with yet another interracial couple, something I‚Äôm enjoying immensely. A bit of Celida (29) and Tucker‚Äôs (31) history was already touched upon in Marked, but even if you read these books out of order, you wouldn‚Äôt feel lost (however, past couples make cameos. If you don‚Äôt want the surprise to be ruined of who ends up with who, then read these in order).I liked Celida‚Äôs confidence and tough chick persona when she was introduced in Marked and assigned to guard Rachel. She had a sweet side that no one got to see aside from her best friend, Zoe, Tuck‚Äôs cousin. Her near brush with death didn‚Äôt stop her from wanting to do her job, however nightmares, insomnia and self doubt plagued her off the clock. And then there was the matter with Tuck. Celida didn‚Äôt think she knew how to do long-term, but she was willing to try, for him.Tuck was the perfect partner for Celida. I think the fact that they‚Äôd once been partners professionally and made a great team helped with their current predicament. They were already attracted, and they knew they could trust and rely on one another if they only managed to cross the last remaining hurdle. I loved that he wasn‚Äôt willing to compromise his wants and goals just to sleep with Celida. Nearly losing her twice made him decide it was worth risking rejection for a relationship rather than just sex, and he only hoped the fiercely independent woman would want him enough to give them a chance at love.I loved them as a couple because they were both strong characters, respected among their peers, dedicated to their jobs, and yet they still had vulnerabilities to show they didn‚Äôt have everything figured out and planed to a T. Naturally, Celida was embarrassed about showing weaknesses, however she surprised me by letting Tuck in once he found out. I loved seeing the support, the tenderness and nonjudgmental side of him. When she pushed, he stayed strong, letting her know she could rely on him. I teared up a lot during the moments with Tuck‚Äôs father.The suspense was great, especially seeing the HRT in action once again. Even though there are no surprises as to who the villains are or what their endgame is in this series, it didn‚Äôt lessen the excitement of seeing the story through till the end. I was more vested in how the main characters would deal with their worst fears coming true rather than mulling over the execution of evil plots. Next up, Zoe and Clay!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342QLNMASNIQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N36ZMFQ#wasThisHelpful","R342QLNMASNIQG","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tags: Romantic Suspense, Friends to Lovers, Heroine: 27, Hero: 32, Interracial/Multicultural, FBI, Ex-MilitaryAt the time of posting, I read all five books currently available in this series. This new to me author is going on my auto buy list. I‚Äôm not usually taken with the first book in any series, but I was hooked from the first page. I had purchased the box set which had the first three books in the series, and I read all three until I couldn‚Äôt stay awake any longer‚Ä¶back-to-back page flipping. And as soon as I finished all three, I purchased the next two so I wouldn‚Äôt have to stop. Two days later and I finished all five plus Ignited, the first book in the Titanium Security series (actually, I read Ignited first and loved it. Since I had this box set on my Kindle already, I just kept reading).What I really enjoyed about this story was the fact that it featured an interracial couple, specifically a Chinese American heroine. In addition, the characters spoke and acted mature, something I often find lacking in the books I read. Throughout the budding relationship, the hero and heroine spoke openly and honestly about what they wanted and acted to make it happen. I‚Äôm thankful that the author didn‚Äôt find it necessary to throw in misunderstandings (in their present) and hem-hawing as a source of conflict. That‚Äôs not to say that everything was smooth sailing for the main characters. The suspense plot involving both supplied more than enough tension.The story was paced well, not too slow to tempt me to skip pages and not too fast that I felt issues were being glossed over. There was a great balance of suspense and action to romance. I didn‚Äôt feel that one area suffered at the expense of another. The romance was believable based on Rachel (27) and Jake‚Äôs (32) history of mutual attraction. Now that they were both grounded in their careers, more mature and they were both at a place in their lives where they knew what they wanted, I didn‚Äôt feel that were rushing into a relationship too quickly. They‚Äôd already been friends and only lost contact for two years. The danger to Rachel and the nature of Jake‚Äôs profession was a convenient catalyst to make them realize that life was too short for regrets. Besides, there were enough tells to make it clear that they both wanted the same thing.The suspense plot wasn‚Äôt over the top, but it wasn‚Äôt dumbed down either. The best part about it was seeing Jake and his team in action while rescuing Rachel and her gullible brother. Rachel handled the grittier parts rather well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCFRVFEFS8NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCAKAOS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCFRVFEFS8NQ","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Salvation picked up around two years after book three.I really liked John. Even with the prior knowledge of who and what he once was, the gentler side of him made me root for him especially during the times he was still being met with wariness. Everyone at Haven knew who he‚Äôd been, but meeting Eve was like a fresh start, a light to the dark and loneliness. Her compassion scared him because he didn‚Äôt think the new him could make up for his past sins or that he was deserving of happiness and forgiveness.Eve was pretty amazing‚Äîtough, sexy, compassionate, bold. She had run away from home at fourteen and learned to fend for herself. She refused to see herself as a victim; she wanted to make her own choices and do what she wanted.They had great sexual chemistry, and the sex scenes were scorching hot, primal, tinged with raw intensity. Although their closeness seemed a little rushed, it was believable because of Eve‚Äôs strong convictions about second chances being a clean slate, and she‚Äôd seen both sides of John‚Äîthe terrifying one borne of flashbacks and nightmares, and the gentle one who tried to earn acceptance and forgiveness every day by doing good. When she learned about his full past, she was strong enough to make the distinction between past and present. It was very fitting to meld the meaning of her rose tattoos with John‚Äôs proclivity for gardening which brought the series to a very touching and satisfying ending.My Kindle book ended at 78% followed by a preview of At Star‚Äôs EndFinal Thoughts:I started with book two by accident, but it still had me hooked, and while one or two things may not have been crystal clear to me, I wasn‚Äôt lost. I think you could read the first two books out of order, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that. While each story closes with a HEA for each couple, the main plot runs through all four books, and an important part of the overall story happens at the end of book three.I really enjoyed the heck out of this series and the author‚Äôs voice. However, I think the series could have benefitted from a little more polishing up or an explanation of a few things.The villain: I didn‚Äôt quite understand how a human was able to make these powerful beings do his bidding. He was quite vulnerable several times and could have easily been taken out. But more on that later.Defenses: The defense against a mind raider was to avoid direct eye contact. The defense against a soul stealer was to avoid touch. The defense against a time thief was ‚Ä¶ nothing. How time thieves on both sides of good and evil didn‚Äôt milk that for all it was worth was beyond me.To kill or not to kill: Leven and his scientists (aka team of Frankensteins) were replicating Nazi experiments, i.e. using humans and anomalies as guinea pigs. Considering he kept coming after Team Haven, it wasn‚Äôt explained why they didn‚Äôt take him out when they had the chance. Bay and Mara each had a chance to end him, yet they didn‚Äôt. The reason given was that they didn‚Äôt want to stoop to his level or be a killer. That made no sense to me at all.Having said that about Leven, I let it go to read the full series, to see where it would go, and there was a good reason why he wasn‚Äôt dealt with sooner. With the last book in mind, it would have made more sense to have Leven escape each time rather than have the good guys look like they valued their own morals over the good of the masses.I know this is science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction, and I‚Äôm not challenging the author‚Äôs prerogative to create the rules for her fictitious world. But for me personally, the questions/issues I had should have made sense in that world, and they just didn‚Äôt.I will still continue to read more of this author‚Äôs work because at the time of posting this, I‚Äôm currently on book two of the Hell Squad series and loving the hell out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTQFSFZO82GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXWWSA0#wasThisHelpful","R2GTQFSFZO82GD","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3.5 out of 5 StarsFull Series Review w/Final Thoughts of all four books on MsRomanticReads.com.The suspense and the advancement of the plot was raised several notches in Soul Stealer. This heroine was different from Bay and Mara in that her parents hadn‚Äôt kicked her to the curb, nor had she been fighting to stay one step ahead of Leven for years. The once genteel school teacher had been turned into a killer, and to her horror, she‚Äôd enjoyed the feeling. Thanks to the group at Haven, she was beginning to heal with Dr. Gage Walker leading the effort. I liked Cate. She was a nice balance of vulnerable and tough, and she was willing to subject herself to tests and experiments to help Gage figure out what made her so special to Leven. The results were actually astonishing.Gage and Cal‚Äôs history were closely entwined, so it was no wonder he didn‚Äôt see himself as a do-gooder. He blamed himself for his brother‚Äôs death, and in the beginning he may have seen it as a small effort at redemption by helping Cate. Until he fell in love. He was sweet in a nerdy way, and it was sweet to see him struggle with his feelings‚Äîthinking that as a doctor he would be taking advantage of her if he reciprocated her tentative advances. Their love scenes seemed to have more tenderness and more feeling to them, but Gage managed to go from nerdy scientist to sexy nerd with a good reserve of stamina; so hot! They were just really sweet together and a perfect match.My biggest complaint with the Leven situation over the course of the first two books was finally dealt with in a manner that made sense, and it was immensely satisfying. Also, the preview of the next book had a twist I didn‚Äôt see coming.My Kindle book ended at 84% followed by a preview of the last book, Salvation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8WVPVESKOLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BANOYD0#wasThisHelpful","RR8WVPVESKOLK","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Series Review w/Final Thoughts of all four books on MsRomanticReads.com.The second book opened with Mara, Bay‚Äôs former roommate and friend, hot on the heels of Leven and trying to rescue a soul stealer named Cate. When the rescue mission turned out to be a trap, Haven‚Äôs fearless leader, Callahan, ended up saving her. But he also inadvertently revealed just one of his many secrets he never wanted her to know.In terms of suspense, this packed a bit more of a punch than the first book. And we learned some interesting things about Callahan, anomaly abilities and some dark history. Even though he wanted Mara badly, Cal believed it would be safer for her if he stayed away. But we know how well those types of plans usually work out.I loved Cal. There‚Äôs something about tortured heroes that is very hard to resist. The burden of his past led to dedicating himself to making up for his past mistakes. He was very protective of the group of anomalies he had under his care and protection, and though he denied it, he deserved happiness for a change. It took courage to bare his soul to Mara at the risk he could lose her forever. It was nice to see a hero who didn‚Äôt try to wring out all the pleasure he could from a heroine to stave off a rejection.While I love tough heroines, Mara was always impatient, preferring to act now rather than plan or strategize. She saw the error of that trait when it nearly killed Cal. Together they really did make a good team, both personally and professionally. The sexy times were sizzling, but not the hottest ones of the four books.I had the same issue with the ending here that I had with the previous book: How could they NOT kill Leven? More than anyone, Mara was the most gung-ho about rescuing anomalies and saving them from what she‚Äôd been through. I wondered if she didn‚Äôt let Cal kill Leven because she now knew that torturing and killing had broken Cal, and therefore she didn‚Äôt want him to go through with it. But on the other hand, they had learned more about Leven‚Äôs plans and knew he‚Äôd never stop. That alone, in addition to all of his other crimes against humanity would have been reason enough to end him. I‚Äôm just not sure how I feel about that. It would have made more sense to have Leven escape each time rather than have the good guys look like they valued their own morals over the good of the masses.My Kindle book ended at 86% followed by a preview of Soul Stealer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D25285KJEJ6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OYZM74#wasThisHelpful","R1D25285KJEJ6N","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Series Review w/Final Thoughts of all four books on MsRomanticReads.com.I don‚Äôt usually gravitate towards Sci-Fi Romances, but three things came together that made me pick this up and read it: 1) the gorgeous cover 2) the blurb 3) it was free and therefore a great way to try a new author and series.Bay had been on the run from Gabriel Leven since her teens, after his wife had tortured and killed her family right in front of her. For someone who‚Äôd been dealt such a blow, I was expecting a hardened woman with little to no compassion left for others except her own kind, but she was the exact opposite. Hearing about Sean‚Äôs own plight and realizing his grief had been taken advantage of, she opened herself up to him and gave as much as she took.For a little while, she‚Äôd hoped they could find a way to be together. But Leven had reminded her why she‚Äôd never have that. She couldn‚Äôt bear to ever see Sean hurt. At someone‚Äôs mercy the way he had been in that desert.Even though Sean started off as one of the bad guys, he still had more humanity in him than could be said for any of Leven‚Äôs other goons. His torment but also his protective side were what made him a worthy hero.The chemistry between Bay and Sean wasn‚Äôt explosive, but more of a simmer. The shower sex was pretty steamy, but their second time was full of tenderness. If you‚Äôre not a fan of sex without protection‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs your warning.The climax baffled me a little because not only did she not take Leven out when she had the chance, her excuse was that she didn‚Äôt want to be like him, and she wondered what her little sister would have thought of her taking a life. And yet she went on to say that Leven would never stop hunting her for her power because his end goal was to build an army of anomalies. If that isn‚Äôt reason enough to get rid of the man, I don‚Äôt know what is. As ridiculous as that sounds, and if you can overlook that to read the next two books, it will make more sense in the end. I just think in order to make the story more plausible, Leven should have escaped on his own rather than have received a reprieve. And at the very end, it‚Äôs not clear how Sean, a human, made it to the island that housed Haven. How or why did Cal allow him to be there?My Kindle book ended at the 87% followed by a preview of the next story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0HXX0QZJ3TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XDGQ2W#wasThisHelpful","RE0HXX0QZJ3TA","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing about sets, it allows you to read the books in order, as well as back-to-back. That's when you notice things like patterns if there are any. I liked was seeing some multicultural/interracial couples, the heroes were all former military, and out of the six heroines, I liked five of them for being tough and bold.What didn‚Äôt work well for me was the almost formulaic execution of each story.

"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 2Iris and Wyatt grew up together‚Äîhe was the son of the town drunk, her mother was one of the few Native Americans who lived in the small town in Georgia. They‚Äôd been looked down upon because of their families and bullied often. They formed a solid friendship and became best friends. That friendship held strong into adulthood. On Iris‚Äô most recent vacation, she‚Äôd married him. When her vacation time was up, she snuck away hoping to get a divorce and let things go back to the way things were. Too bad for her, Wyatt had entirely different plans.I really adored these two together. Not only did they have a foundation of friendship for at least two decades to build upon, they were both stubborn, passionate, and whether they wanted to admit it or not, they truly cared for one another. It seemed their pride was the barrier that kept them from communicating. Iris was a tough as nails woman, not surprisingly since she was a former Marine, however underneath she had insecurities. She liked control, and she had no problem facing down the dangers of her job. Wyatt was her equal, but he didn‚Äôt know how to get her to stay and give them a chance.I loved seeing a woman be in charge of protecting a man, her man. The attempts on his life seemed to be the nudge she needed to realize she didn‚Äôt want to live without him if he really wanted her. Likewise, Wyatt had already a scare of his own where she was concerned. Unlike some of the other couples, I felt their chemistry. The suspense here was more interesting than in the previous book.Wyatt‚Äôs best friend and bodyguard, Jay, and Wyatt‚Äôs assistant Ellie had an interesting relationship, one I‚Äôd like to hear more about. Both couples made an appearance in First Surrender, the first book in the Serafina: Sin City series.

"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 2Charlotte and her husband of five years had grown apart and were on the brink of a divorce. Then she found out he‚Äôd been cheating on her when one of his mistresses showed up on their doorstep. Angry and hurt, she turned to her husband‚Äôs best friend, Kell. She thought Kell was a safe bet since he was a player and wouldn‚Äôt get the wrong idea. What she didn‚Äôt know was that he‚Äôd been in love with her for a long time, and hearing those three little words made her push him away. Then her husband died and she was pregnant.Charlotte obviously and understandably had some hangups about fidelity, but while she felt that familiar pull towards Kell, she kept trying to talk herself out of addressing the elephant in the room. She was timid, always cutting him off whenever she thought he‚Äôd say something that might hurt her feelings, instead of talking to each other, she held on to her assumptions about him being a player and didn‚Äôt believe anything remotely nice he had to say. While I admired Kell for immediately stepping up and wanting to be there for his three month old child, I‚Äôm not sure how I felt about him guilting her into living under his roof temporarily so he could see his son anytime he wanted. To his credit, he always spoke what was on his mind and made his intentions towards her very clear. I wasn‚Äôt convinced of them as a couple just because of their past and now that a child was in the picture, their coming together seemed almost forced because of the child rather than through actual communication.Considering Charlotte‚Äôs greatest fear or hang-up about a man who cheats and the way she found out about her husband, it was too obvious there was going to be some drama when Kell‚Äôs psychotic ex-fling showed up.The ending was okay. At least the near brush with death made Charlotte realize a few things and she was more open to giving love another shot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RGRXHCOE74N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUYHX6U#wasThisHelpful","R10RGRXHCOE74N","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 2Rating: 4.5 out of 5 StarsOut of the first six books, this was my favorite. Travis was introduced in Belle and Grant‚Äôs story, Danger Next Door. Belle had called her pierced and tattooed rescuer Mr. Mohawk. In this story, he‚Äôd since cleaned up, trading his mohawk for a buzz cut. What I loved the most about him was that underneath the reserved but tough, colorful and intimidating exterior lurked such a lovable and somewhat shy man. Cue the swoon.I thought it was sweet that they'd fooled around a lot while getting used to being a couple. It made their first time that much steamier. Noel had a few insecurities, but she pretty much smacked them down every time they surfaced. Aside from that, she was bold, confident and open.I loved that both of them were always able to muster up enough courage to say what they were thinking or voice their wants, rejection or disappointment be damned. In that, they were incredibly sweet and mature.The suspense portion of the story was over before anything really happened. Honestly, it didn‚Äôt really serve a purpose. These two were on the verge of getting to know each other a little better anyway, but the potential danger was a good excuse to stay close together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKY95T6VIMOF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZNM7ZY#wasThisHelpful","RKY95T6VIMOF8","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 1Fatal Deception picked up the same day where Danger Next Door ended. Throughout the first two books, hints had been dropped that something was wrong in Harrison and Mara‚Äôs marriage. While predictable that she was in some sort of trouble, the nature of it was a nice surprise.I really liked Mara for her toughness, self-sufficiency, and her big secret that made her one kick-ass heroine. While she wasn‚Äôt a woman who needed to be saved from danger and violence, she did need to be saved on an emotional level. That struggle was what drew me in to her story.I understood her reasons for her behavior, however, I was disappointed that she was depicted like those heroes who make unilateral decisions without talking to their partners into consideration. What she thought was a selfless act was something I found utterly selfish. She knew he was a former CIA agent and could take care of himself (heck he made a living out of protecting others). I felt sorry for Harrison and couldn‚Äôt fault him for thinking their entire marriage had been a lie. The only place that seemed secret and deception free was in the bedroom. The sex was hot (the hottest of the three books), and for a woman with her background, the fact she had no problem giving up control to him spoke volumes of her love for him.Again, the suspense was decent but rather rushed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR3XKXU539OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KWCWY6#wasThisHelpful","R1RR3XKXU539OK","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 1I‚Äôm glad I decided to continue on to the next story in the set because it was so much better than the first book. The plot was more exciting, the heroine (24) was not a whiny, annoying character, and the hero was both vulnerable and alpha.We met Detective Grant Caldwell briefly in the first book. Danger Next Door opened with a life changing moment for Grant‚Äîhe was caught in an explosion during a raid which left him scarred and a blown out knee. While closing himself off from the world, he notices his new next door neighbor, Belle. Even though he felt unworthy because of his extensive scars, when Belle needed help, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to protect her.I loved Belle. She craved normalcy and some peace from her huge, loud and annoyingly overprotective family. She was exerting her independence, she was sweet, compassionate and bold. For once it was nice to see a heroine take the initiative to make a move on the hero.Unlike Lizzy, she appreciated Grant's overprotective streak within reason. She never went off half-cocked but rather wanted to be talked to and consulted. I enjoyed their dynamic of her setting boundaries, and Grant didn‚Äôt steamroll her. Their chemistry was believable and felt natural. The sex was hot, but I was mostly touched by the tenderness they shared over their mutual scars.The suspense was predictable, and once again, the hero happened to be close enough to rescue her from a serial killer, but since I expected as much, I was more drawn to the progression of their relationship and the feels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYC5LOQA6FLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00882GFR4#wasThisHelpful","R3SYC5LOQA6FLW","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased and read as part of the Red Stone Security Series Box Set: Volume 1If I had purchased this book individually instead of the box set, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bothered with the rest after reading about Elizabeth and Porter.To be blunt, the heroine (25) was an imbecile. Here was an intelligent woman with a PhD in computer science and the security manager for Red Stone Security. And yet when she‚Äôd captured the interest of the head of a drug cartel, no thanks to her junkie brother, she insisted she could handle the problem herself instead of asking her very nice employer for help. For years, she‚Äôd been bailing her brother Benny out of trouble at the risk of her own life (one time she was nearly gang raped because Benny happened to be in a seedy part of town).She constantly bucked against Porter telling her what to do for her safety; but when that man is a security specialist, a lover who cared deeply and there had been one incident after another escalating from intimidation to near murder, she should have listened. Sadly, her character didn‚Äôt seem to know the difference between stubbornness and stupidity. I wanted to shake her and tell her that family loyalty wouldn't do her any good if she was dead.There were extenuating circumstances that explained the strong bond between Benny and Lizzy and why she repeatedly put herself in jeopardy for him, but that came to light at the end of the story. By that time I'd already written her off. Perhaps it was a cultural thing to stand by the family no matter how badly they f*ed up, but I couldn‚Äôt believe she willingly stayed with her parents just to get some space from Porter.I liked that they'd dated for a month in the past but didn't go all the way of having sex. Nor did they fall into bed during all the opportunities once he began protecting her again. They held back and built more trust between them before taking that last step. However, I didn‚Äôt feel their chemistry. Perhaps that‚Äôs why my feelings about them are at opposite ends of the spectrum‚Äîreally disliked the heroine, and I can‚Äôt think of anything to say about Porter other than I liked him for not giving up on her and for trying to talk some sense into her.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UY2OEUAAY4YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ED610Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UY2OEUAAY4YR","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Victorian era/Contemporary time travel romance was very enjoyable. Dear Author featured it in their Daily Deals; the short summary made me pick it up, and I finished it the same day.Victoria was feisty, and even though she found herself in a crazy new world, she never conformed to the new place and time. I pretty much loved everything about her and that she approached her feelings towards Nicholas with equal amounts of trepidation and boldness.When Nicholas let his guard down, he was deliciously wicked, sexy and cheeky. He had good reason to be broody and ticked off with Victoria considering all of the things his wife had done to him. He struggled with the growing feelings for Victoria just as much as she did, and while wary of her, he had enough presence of mind to note the differences and tried to set aside his misgivings to see where they would go.Two of the most frequent complaints amongst reviews were 1) how often the F-bomb was dropped, and 2) the graphic sex scenes. I wasn't bothered and this was definitely more erotic than the typical historical romance. Also, the heroine was a modern American woman in Victorian England. She never attempted to mask her ""strange"" colloquialisms, so I forgave those particulars that bothered others.The story was told from alternating POVs and from both times, although the past was more prevalent than the present. While this was a very sexy and sensual soul-mate story, it wasn't all hearts and flowers. The suspense and intrigue was predictable but not bad. Despite the HEA ending, I wasn't particularly happy with the climax which was rather depressing especially regarding Andrew. However the journal entries from Nicholas at the end made up for that.I loved the feisty heroine and the sexy but jaded Nicholas, and I definitely enjoyed their time in the past more than the present. There were three noticeable tense errors and one spelling error, but nothing that detracted from the story. I‚Äôd pick this up again for a re-read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJQK3JTYT4I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZ3IURM#wasThisHelpful","R3KJQK3JTYT4I5","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley for the purpose of an honest review.Man down!When the Crazy Eight lost one of their own, it changed everything.An oath swornWith his dying breath, Rusty Lawrence made his band of brothers promise him they would leave the Navy and live life to the fullest.After reading the prequel to this new series in the Way of the Warrior anthology (which was fantastic, and author and publisher proceeds go to the Wounded Warrior Project), I knew I'd want to read the first, full-length novel. If Navy SEALs are your thing, you need this book! Julie Ann Walker did an amazing job of transporting me to the Florida Keys, and she kept me on the edge of my seat with the brilliantly described scenes of deep sea diving and tactical (underwater) SEAL action. The biggest bonus of all was the humor interlaced throughout, courtesy of Bran, the suspense and tough female characters.Leo ‚ÄúThe Lion‚Äù Anderson and his former SEAL team had honored their friend‚Äôs dying wish and embarked on a new adventure: the quest for high-seas adventure and treasure hunting. Even after ‚Äúretirement‚Äù, Leo still felt a responsibility towards his men; to make sure their venture would be profitable since they‚Äôd thrown their lot in with him. On the personal front, he couldn‚Äôt get CIA agent Olivia Mortier out of his head since a mission in Syria. What I really liked about him was that he put others before himself, and he always deferred to the others before making big decisions. As Bran put it, that made him an excellent and trustworthy leader. Once in mission mode, he was calm, focused and deadly.Olivia (30) was a kicka** heroine. I loved her confidence and courage. Despite having grown up in an orphanage and excelling in a job that didn't allow much room for romantic stability, I loved that she didn‚Äôt shy away from her growing feelings for Leo. She embraced them and took what she could. I understood the guilt she carried over Rusty‚Äôs death, misplaced as it was.Bran wasn‚Äôt off the mark with his jokes about their combustible chemistry. I enjoyed all the times Bran coc‚Ä¶interrupted their sexy time because duty called. The push and pull between them developed at a good, steady pace, so that when they finally came together, it made the wait well worth while. There were several sexy scenes and one very steamy (pun intended) sex scene. I didn't really like that she didn't dare confess to Leo what had happened in Syria, especially when it became predictable that the truth would come out in a way she couldn't control.The story was paced well, and above all else, a page turner. The romance didn't overshadow the great suspense. Along with the retrieval of chemical weapons plot, there was also the matter of flushing out a CIA mole, and the setup of Bran's story with the feisty Madison Powers. From the interaction between Bran and Madison, I can't wait for their story as they seemed to make quite a good match. Bran really stood out in this story. I loved how protective he was of Leo, and his team mates in general.The story was told from multiple POVs (Leo, Olivia, Bran, Mason, and the CIA mole). I deducted half a star for the many pop culture references, mostly movies. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they were funny, and I got all of them, especially the Lethal Weapon reference (one of my favorite Murtaugh moments, by the way). It was cute the first few times, but eventually the cuteness wore off. There was also a brief case of head hopping between Mason and Bran that threw me off a little. But aside from that, this book had EVERYTHING I love in romantic suspense‚Äîmen of honor, strong female characters, good action and humor. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who shares my taste in books in that genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R521BDIJMS8P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q571YD4#wasThisHelpful","R521BDIJMS8P4","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 out of 5 Stars*Complimentary ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley for the purpose of an honest review.For an author to be able to make me like and grow to love a 23 year old heroine is nigh impossible, but Ms. Smith pulled off that miracle. And if that wasn't enough, the sizzling, sensual and erotic assault from the chemistry between Fenn and Hayden was a delicious torture. And finally, the author wasn't afraid to include suspense tinged with a darkness that was somewhat chilling and could be a trigger.I loved Hayden's (23) firecracker personality. She was sassy without being childish, unlike most heroines her age. A great combination of beauty and brains. She was bold, outgoing, compassionate and empathetic. As a submissive, she had a reputation for being mouthy, aggressive, and trying to top from the bottom. Hayden secretly longed for a dom to control her in the bedroom, but she‚Äôd never been able to trust one. Thanks to oppressive, elitist snobs as parents, she yearned to be be free. That yearning automatically suppressed her natural submissive nature.Fenn (33) was a wonderful hero. His tragic childhood and the man he grew up to be against all odds, as well as his love and protective streak for his adopted family showed a deeply compassionate and honorable side of him. He was also a dominant like his twin, without the BDSM background. Another thing I loved was the contrast in lifestyles between the two twins. Where Emery was a CEO type, Fenn grew up to be a cowboy and bull rider. A dominant cowboy? Hell yes, please!There were six sex scenes in total, and each one of them was a sensual assault on the libido. I loved Hayden and Fenn together because they each gave the other what they wanted or needed. I'd say this was a BDSM-lite story because it was mostly bondage and spanking without the other lifestyle nuances. No condoms were used (he was clean and she had an IUD). Just in case that bothers anyone.The identity of the true villain pulling the strings wasn't really a secret, but that didn't dampen my enjoyment of the unfolding events. I felt there was a nice trade-off between suspense and romance that built up gradually towards the climax. The villain's reason may have seemed lame, but he was a nutjob. The assassin surprised me. Despite some of Greyson's despicable actions in this story, there appeared to be room for redemption. While I admired Hayden's courage in the end, she still managed to get herself into trouble (twice) which made things more difficult for the guys.The epilogue set up Wes and Callie's story, and call me cruel, but I enjoyed the moment when Wes gave Callie a wake-up call that Fenn was irrevocably off the market. I can not wait for that story (the heroine is twenty but she wasn't annoying in this book, so I have high hopes).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28X45AI74WWYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRVAG8A#wasThisHelpful","R28X45AI74WWYE","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary ARC provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.BIND was probably the best book I‚Äôve read by Sierra Cartwright to date! The beginning was reminiscent of Fifty Shades, but where Fifty seemed reliant on ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù, BIND was more pleasing in all aspects. The smattering of humor throughout did a great job of diffusing the intensity of the developing relationship.Lana Bertrand, CFO of Bertrand Holdings Inc., had learned all about the family business from her father. She was a daddy‚Äôs girl through and through, until she completed graduate school and began to challenge his outdated business decisions and practices. The fact that she had contemplated giving up two years of her life to save the company spoke a lot about her dedication, determination, loyalty. She was a workaholic with no time for relationships, and she‚Äôd been repeatedly disappointed by past lovers and the way they handled her kinkier desires. She was confident, bold, and generally unafraid to express herself sexually. Dealing with developing romantic feelings did not come easy to her at all.Connor Donovan (27) had been appointed president of his family‚Äôs company, Donovan Worldwide, at the age of 23, after his father had died tragically in a car accident. His parent‚Äôs marriage wasn‚Äôt perfect, but what he knew was enough to turn him off of pursuing any serious relationships. I loved his relationship with his siblings both in and out of the business. When he was first introduced, from Lara‚Äôs perspective, he seemed aloof, a bit cold, and he definitely commanded the space in which he moved. Since the story was told from alternating POVs, it turned out he was anything but cold and reserved. I just loved the way he talked‚Äîeverything he said was measured, considered, charming and intelligent. For someone his age and in his position, he was very down to earth.Probably the most intriguing aspect of this story was Lara‚Äôs proposal and Connor‚Äôs conditions and whether or not a reader would see him as taking unfair advantage of her predicament. Her position coupled with his promises of giving her a taste of what she'd only fantasized about was definitely a catalyst for the fast pace of their sexual relationship. Also, the way he treated her as an equal outside of the bedroom and his unwavering support in business showed her that being able to rely on him was a core element of his personality and not just a selfish means to get laid. Personally, I enjoyed the set-up and the execution. It was anything but trite because the characters were so compelling. The BDSM parts were kept to introduction to the lifestyle and spanking, but the seduction and the sex were incredibly hot.The side characters enhanced and complimented the couple, and I adored Lara‚Äôs mother and her ‚ÄúESP‚Äù abilities, as Lara liked to call it. And for fans of the BONDS series, Julien was his usual awesome self and returned for a bit of meddling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3950F0WJDBFGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZJESSO#wasThisHelpful","R3950F0WJDBFGA","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley for the purpose of an honest review.I really liked the first book in the series, but...I loved the second book so much more! I could say it was book one on steroids. The heartache was gut-wrenching, the chemistry and passion made me drool all over my e-reader screen, and it had some of the most tender, impressionable moments that sent me into swoon overload. There may have been a brief crying jag or two involved.Sofie's anger and hurt was understandable, even though I thought seven years was a long time to hold on to that. But then, the more I learned about the kind of person Sofie was, the more I understood why she'd never gotten over that night that changed their lives. What I loved the most about her was how caring and intuitive she was. At the end, her father has some very good advice for her in the form of an anecdote. That moment pretty much summed her up perfectly. At first glance, it might seem as if she caved too quickly and too easily to Donovan and his seduction. It may have seemed impulsive, reckless and had heartbreak written all over it, but I think reading the book cover to cover made it clear why she didn't or couldn't walk away.Donovan. I understood why Sofie had zero defenses where he was concerned. The details of his childhood were so heart-breaking, even I would have been determined to be that woman who could save him. Was he a little callous with her feelings both in the past and the present as their pseudo relationship took off again? Yes, however he had made no promises and even if he wasn't one hundred percent clear with her about his plans post charity event, the signs were hard for even her to miss completely. What surprised and delighted me were those few vulnerable moments where he actually acted like he wanted to be saved, wanted to be good enough for her, wanted to love her.  He even gave her a clear out at one point; he gave her a chance to walk away.My favorite thing about this story was, for all the uncertainty that clouded several of their ridiculously hot moments, they did open up about quite a lot of things, laying cards on the table, so to speak. When they weren't overthinking what they were to each other, their playfulness and some of the cute dialogues just endeared them to me that much more. The ending made me tear up, but in both good and bad ways. I loved how they found the courage to go after what they wanted and the story was wrapped up with a fabulous epilogue set another seven years later.This story that ebbed and flowed, never got boring, pushed and pulled the characters in ways that made them grow and had love scenes to make the hearts of any romance junkie soar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZARTNUWUWJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NERQR5I#wasThisHelpful","RRZARTNUWUWJ3","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary ARC provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review.Out of all the couples in the series thus far, Sean and Melody were my favorite, and not just because the heroine was a dancer. I had no idea that the love Sean felt for Sidney went THAT deep. He called it pathetic, but I found it heartbreaking. As if his love life wasn't enough of a problem, he was tired of being the invisible band member. Of all the guys, he seemed the most...normal. But he did have a few moments that made him come across as a jerk, but I blamed that on his tunnel vision where Sidney was concerned.I was stunned and disappointed by Sidney and Mason's obliviousness to Sean's distress, or perhaps they just hoped it would go away with time and they wouldn't have to talk about it. The irony wasn't lost on me that Sean wanted more fame, and he eventually fell for a woman who couldn't get away from fame fast enough.I was a little torn about Melody. She was very perceptive early on about being only a ""distraction"", and aside from telling him about her scars, she was open and honest with him. Her inner monologues indicated that she'd been a completely different person before her accident that left her badly scarred. She used to be flirtatious, confident, outgoing, large and in charge, and at the top of her game. I couldn't blame her for not wanting to expose her scars or bare herself emotionally too soon. After all, I imagine how it would feel to Google the man you're falling in love with only to find a video of a sex scandal. It was one thing to know he was hung up on another woman and another to see or hear him having sex with her. However, I did tire of her pity party even past the 89% mark. Her sister gave her good advice; even Leah gave her a talking to, but instead of listening to them, she turned to her former boss for the confidence boost that never came.When they were together and forgot the rest of the world, they were amazing. Sean was capable of such kindness and (com)passion, and he was amazing in bed. Their first time was off the charts hot! It was rough and dirty with a hint of dominance. Sean apparently liked a bit of pain with his pleasure and she matched him. The way he tried to help her in the end was a tear-jerker. The author also did a great job of describing the choreography of their dance. Despite some of my grumblings about the heroine, I really did like the story as a whole. It was also less angsty than its predecessors. Of the four books, this is the one I'd read again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B7TRK78DCDN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US8A64E#wasThisHelpful","R2B7TRK78DCDN3","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary copy provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review. Pre-ordered a personal copy afterwards.This was a fantastic set of novellas either from existing series, or prequels of new, upcoming series like Julie Ann Walker's Deep Six series and Lea Griffith's Endgame Ops series.Julie Ann Walker's HOT AS HELL  featured Harper Searcy who didn't want to fall for a soldier, but she couldn‚Äôt forget her hot Navy SEAL friend or their one night stand. When the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan where she worked came under attack by terrorists, there was only one man she knew would move heaven and earth to rescue her, Michael ‚ÄúMad Dog‚Äù Wainwright.In Catherine Mann's IN PLAIN SIGHT, Stacy Currie believed her ex-husband was her stalker. A frantic 911 call not only brought the cavalry but also a very welcome blast from her past. Could she convince her childhood sweetheart that, despite his scars and blindness, they deserved their second chance at love?Kate SeRine's TORN was a lovely friends to lovers story. Best friends since childhood, Sadie Keaton and Joe Dawson never crossed the line, afraid it could ruin years of friendship. Finally home from deployment, Joe and Sadie began to see each other in a completely different light. As friendship and passion collided, Sadie's stalker threatened to tear them apart.Lea Griffith's WAR GAMES with it's conspiracy theory and unexpected twists had a slightly darker edge. Anthony ‚ÄúRook‚Äù Granger was serving time for the deaths of his entire Delta Force unit on a mission gone south. CIA cyber spook, Olivia Bentwood was convinced Rook had been set up. Together they embarked on a dangerous mission for answers while getting personal.Tina Wainscott's BEAUTY AND THE MARINE had a Beauty and the Beast theme. Model Kristy Marsden enlisted the help of Chase Justiss and his team to help flush out her stalker. Ex-Marine Griff Tate, badly burned and scarred preferred seclusion over the pitying looks from strangers. Would he leave the safety of his parent's land to rescue be with the woman who'd captured his heart?M. L. Buchman's NSDQ had a military heroine! Lois Lang, former Army combat pilot, had to adjust to the new reality of never being able to fly again and deal with the prospect of romance. Kendall Clark vowed never to date a soldier. Well...never say never. It was her determination and Kendall being the steady rock willing to lose her in order to win her heart that made this story a joy to read.Anne Elizabeth's SEALed WITH A PASSION was a reunited lovers story. Five years had passed since interior decorator Alisha Winters last saw Navy SEAL Jonah Melo. A one night stand, a misunderstanding and an unexpected reunion put this couple to the test.Suzanne Brockmann's HOME FIRE INFERNO was very different from the rest. Whacky and fun. While her Navy SEAL husband was mission ready overseas, Jennilyn Gillman went into labor on the side of the road, in the desert. Between her sister-law, various friends and family, a race against time to launch a rescue was humorously executed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLW5R74C6ARQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492608998#wasThisHelpful","RLW5R74C6ARQI","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased and read as part of the Supernatural anthology.The vampire Uriel had always wanted a mate, but ever since he‚Äôd been marked by a Jinn and his powers grew exponentially, he gave up on that dream for fear he could potentially harm anyone close to him. He got tasked with rescuing the mother of a halfbreed Jinn because it was deemed a danger that she could be used as leverage to hand over a child that was the key to the resurrection of the Dark Lord. With Uriel‚Äôs hatred of Jinns or anything involving them, he was less than enthused with his mission.The gypsies Kata, and her twin sister, Marika had always been inseparable. Then Marika was kidnapped and turned into a vampire. Any trace of Kata‚Äôs sister was gone forever, and in her place was a power-hungry, evil [blank] who‚Äôd teamed up with a wizard with plans on resurrecting the Dark Lord. Marika had captured Kata and forced a Jinn upon her, and the result was Laylah.Fast forward to the rescue, instal-attraction sparks between Kata and Uriel, and they momentarily forgot their hatred of Jinns and vampires. Before they could escape, they got sucked into the underworld. Marika somehow returned from the dead to fight them, Kata and Uriel succumbed to their lust, more battling, then the mystery behind Uriel‚Äôs mark was solved. End of story.The sex was hot, and the suspense was good. I also liked these two as a couple. Kata was a feisty heroine, not at all whiny, demanding or spineless. Uriel started out as a broody hero but he quickly warmed with his rising interest in Kata. They got intimate very quickly, but for a novella in the middle of a series, I suspect this was a treat for fans of the series. I thought it was fitting but still very well-written and executed.Alexandra Ivy was a new to me author, so this anthology was a great opportunity to get acquainted with her writing. I must say, I really enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IH6MZ84NZA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR6QU#wasThisHelpful","R3IH6MZ84NZA8","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Grim Reaper is through playing Heaven‚Äôs stud for hire and wants a mate. The angel Lilliana has a choice to make: agree to become Azagoth‚Äôs mate and steal his chronoglass or refuse and be punished. A lose/lose situation. And then she met Tall, Dark and Deadly.For a novella, there was a lot of back story on Azagoth, enough to make him feel like a complete and well-rounded character. Like many other characters in the Lords of Deliverance series, he was a pawn in the games between Heaven and Sheoul, but he was also cunning, resourceful and a great strategist to ensure he could play his hand and win when necessary. Probably the most surprising trait of his was how he‚Äôd taken to fatherhood. Even though his offspring were all by design, he cared for his children and was hurt when they sided against him. That he actually wanted a mate instead of accidentally stumbling onto one (the theme of most stories) was a nice change. And I loved that the chosen heroine had an ability that was connected to Azagoth, thus making her a perfect match. I loved his cheeky, playful side. Especially when he tried to keep her off balance in the beginning.I really liked Lilliana. One moment she appeared shy and intimidated and the next she showed backbone and a bit of fire. She managed to flip the switch on and off depending on the situation. A planned betrayal of Azagoth may have been the reason for her being in Sheoul-gra in the beginning, but seeing that plan and her perception of the sexy Grim Reaper slowly crumble made this read an incredibly satisfying journey. The playfulness laced with sexual tension between these two characters made me root for them in every way.The sex between them was all-consuming, passionate and so hot. Call me a pervert, but the fact that she fondled Azagoth in his beast form was ridiculously sexy! There‚Äôs nothing sexier in PNR than when a heroine easily accepts the beast half, shows just how accepting she can be, and when said acceptance and tenderness fells the beast.Of course it wasn‚Äôt all hearts and flowers, but Lilliana‚Äôs eyes were finally opened to what she wanted, and Azagoth learned that he wasn‚Äôt as alone as he thought. What Lilliana, Idess, and Reaver did for him in the end was really touching.I‚Äôm excited for HADES and have already pre-ordered my print copy. If you haven‚Äôt read any of the books in the Demonica or Lords of Deliverance series, you are missing out on one amazing world and countless hours of exciting entertainment filled with fantastic writing, dialogue and characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FN6EWD1BDTUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4JG5PO#wasThisHelpful","R3FN6EWD1BDTUT","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary copy provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review.I‚Äôm hard to please when it comes to heroines. There were times I found myself just waiting for Sabrina to act a certain way, do or say something that I‚Äôve come to expect from other characters in similar situations. I was pleasantly surprised that she didn‚Äôt disappoint me. She had a good heart, she was compassionate, sweet, confident and seemed mature.As a child of the foster care system, Sabrina didn‚Äôt have a happy childhood. She‚Äôd always dreamt of having someone she could share her life with along with all of its ups and downs. Therefore, finding out that she‚Äôd been reckless and deceived by her most recent love was not only a blow but a revelation. It was nice to see her be aware of her quickly evolving feelings, and she took the time to examine them closely.In contrast, Malcolm had the happy childhood, and we got some background from his thoughts as well as from Sabrina‚Äôs recollections of their conversations. The sacrifice and death of his twin brother and former Army Ranger hit him hard and filled him with misplaced guilt. His meltdown in front of Sabrina said a lot about the kind of person he was. Malcolm didn‚Äôt have a huge ego. That much seemed evident on their ‚Äúdate‚Äù nights‚Äîpreferring to take her to a local eatery rather than a fancy restaurant. I also liked his blunt honesty right from the very beginning, thereby letting Sabrina know what she would be getting into.For me, the character background and development was sufficient, considering the length of the story and the story's timeframe. They did take the time to open up about themselves before sleeping with each other (not much, but they did make themselves a little more vulnerable, and I got the feeling that they could communicate quite well if they‚Äôd wanted to). I enjoyed the build-up of sexual tension. That they both retained control over their lust made Mal appear honorable and Sabrina not appear as an easy lay. The conflict was surprisingly enjoyable. Sabrina overheard something that would have sent most heroines into a crying fit and playing off the sex as if it had been one huge mistake. She handled the situation with grace. The ending was predictable, but what a lovely ending it was! The little speech her gave her when was putting herself down was awesome. The back to back sex scenes, though smoking hot (outdoor sex, truck sex, shower sex) were a little numbing all in one go.Out of Bounds was the perfect short, sexy, and hot read to get lost in for a few hours on this rainy afternoon. I found Sabrina and Malcolm very likable, and their chemistry, as the blurb already pointed out, was indeed combustible and impossible to deny. Even though their ages were never brought up, both of them were mature in their words and actions. If you‚Äôre looking for fast-paced, angst-free, insta-lust story, then this is definitely for you. I'd definitely whip this out and read it again when I need a quick, sexy, feel good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5QLHKK8GQWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNOPNXC#wasThisHelpful","R1H5QLHKK8GQWS","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Complimentary copy received via Inkslinger PR for an honest review. But I enjoyed it so much that I pre-ordered a print.Rating: 4.5 out of 5When detective and Dom Atticus Ware meets southern belle Virginia Cunningham during a BDSM camp weekend, sparks fly. Will their budding relationship survive her abandonment issues, his aversion to shrinks, a prison break and a kidnapping? As far as I'm concerned, this was expectedly another excellent read in this series.Gin was a delightful heroine with her southern charm. She was born and raised in the Bible Belt and learned that courtesy and appearance were placed higher than competence and aptitude. Her ex-fianc√©, Preston, had expected passiveness and obedience, something she was willing to do if it kept him from walking out on her. That‚Äôs not to say she didn‚Äôt have a backbone. It was delightful to have a heroine like her (with her hangups) step out of her shell and see that she was more than the sum of what she‚Äôd been taught‚Äîhow to behave, how to live. She was well aware of her emotional pattern and actively tried to put herself first.Atticus (34+), ex-Marine and current detective was near perfect. His only flaw, if you can call it one, was that he jumped to conclusions quickly, allowing his feelings to override his head. With his brother Sawyer (ex-Navy SEAL) in jail serving time for DUI manslaughter, Atticus left the family ranch in Idaho for California to be closer to him, bless his heart. I loved the strong connection between him and Sawyer. I‚Äôll say it right now, I hope Sawyer gets a story as well because the poor guy deserves some love.Their first meeting was both amusing and sexy. Amusing because Atticus didn't know that Gin was an honest to goodness novice in the BDSM world. The more time they spent together, the more complicated things became--from the conflict of interest with being Sawyer's counselor to the crumbling of her self-imposed rule of no relationships. She knew she had to learn to differentiate between an unhealthy need to please (i.e. to keep a man by her side by waiting on him hand and foot) and doing something nice for a man out of love or general concern. The inevitable heartbreak on both sides was hard to read. As much as I disliked what Gin had said to Atticus and his reaction, she needed that wake-up call and the distance to look deep inside herself. I especially loved that the author had Atticus step up to help her instead of having her struggle on her own or ask her friends for help.The story delivered the feels and the danger. The climax of the story was action packed with lots of heroics all around. Just a warning though, if graphic threats of rape are a trigger, you may want to skip that part.‚Äî QUOTE ‚ÄîHow could she tell the teacher no? Her reluctant feet carried her to the Dom.

While she wasn't ready for a real relationship again, she began dating Xavier, an ex-MMA fighter turned business billionaire and Ryder's best friend. The last thing she wanted was to find out that they were going to fight for her, literally.What I liked about Tessa was her independent spirit. Even though Xavier could and would have provided anything she needed, she was determined to keep working as a waitress to support herself and her son. I understood why she split up with the man she loved, and I didn't get the feeling that she was pushy or selfish for wanting to know about his demons. After all, some of the behavior he displayed was both concerning and heartbreaking.Once on Eden, in a fit of frustration with the men, she called their bluff by suggesting she needed to compare them to figure out who she should choose. Her idea backfired as they agreed to share her. They'd each get to spend a whole day with her alone, without interference and alternate.Fight For Me was told from Tessa's POV in the first person, and through most of it she sounded monotonous and depressing. She didn't want a new relationship, she was still in love with Ryder, but she began dating his best friend. Xavier declared his love for her and she had no answer. Xavier knew what dark secret Ryder had been keeping from Tessa, and yet he didn't back off and let his two friends try to work things out. The love triangle aspect was sexy albeit predictable. Everyone just seemed rather wishy-washy with their feelings. The suspense portion of the story felt a little forced in terms of being the means by which Ryder would get to exorcise his demons once and for all. Overall the book wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCICKOOK569H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8BM8UG#wasThisHelpful","R2OCICKOOK569H","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Return to Sender/Sweet Return by Steena HolmesInvitation to Eden #15Part of a Series: Love So Sweet #3Tags: Contemporary, Sweet Romance, M/F, Reunited Lovers, Heroine: 25-29, DNFLength: 9 Chapters*Purchased and read as part of THE BAD BOYS OF EDEN: Billionaires, Alphas, Bikers, and Doms Boxed Set.Steena Holmes was another new to me author from this collection. Return To Sender is the same story as Sweet Return (the third book in the Sweet Love Series) except one of them has bonus material.I didn't finish this story (quit at 84%). The reason why Marc stood her up six years ago boiled down to cowardice, among a few other things. Lauren had every right to demand answers and to understand his actions, and while I applauded his honesty regardless of how painful or detrimental it may be to their future, I got frustrated with Lauren for constantly running away as soon as she heard something she didn't like. She'd pined for him for six years, and she couldn't stand her ground and talk to him like an adult? By the time I'd given up on their story, she'd bolted two or three times. Talking to a random stranger opened her eyes, so I stopped there knowing they'd get their HEA. I just wasn't invested in their journey anymore. What I did read was okay, but I'm not compelled to pick up any other books from this author.Even though this was a sweet romance, I thought it still fit in the Eden collection, after all the island makes wishes come true.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVTE5ISIO7TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGIGO6A#wasThisHelpful","R1QVTE5ISIO7TN","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Purchased and read as part of THE BAD BOYS OF EDEN: Billionaires, Alphas, Bikers, and Boxed Set.Invitation to Eden # N/APart of a Series: Purgatory Club #6Tags: Contemporary, Erotic Romance, M/F, BBW, Heroine: 24, BDSM, AnalLength: 15 ChaptersEliza Gayle is, was, a new to me author. After reading this novella, the sixth one in her Purgatory Club series, I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt hold my interest enough to want to check out the other books.Bonnie (24) was a ""baby girl"" to her Dom, Jim. He'd been older, wiser and his life was chaos free. Then he died of cancer leaving Bonnie feeling adrift. Some time before Jim's death, he'd introduced her to Dex, Club Purgatory's favorite Dom and notorious for remaining detached. She felt guilty that she'd felt a spark with Dex, a man not her Dom. But he was willing to give her what she needed while she mourned, and she only had two rules: no sex, just flogging, and they'd only scene for one night a month. Somewhere during those months she'd fallen in love with Dex, and apparently he wasn't unaffected by her either.During a scene, he gave her the ultimate release, both emotional and physical. She ran out on him when she realized they'd never have more. Gabe sent her on a mini vacation to Eden and tricked Dex into going as well.I really liked this couple, and Bonnie was stronger than she gave herself credit for. That she burdened herself with so much emotional baggage told me that she was a good person, kind, loving, loyal to a fault, and just plain sweet. Dex may have been the club's favorite for many reasons, but I got a kick out of seeing his feathers ruffled because of her, her actions, and Gabe's sneaky interference. I also liked the ""meat"" of the story, and that it wasn't just all about sex. Dex had his own demons, a result from an alcoholic and abusive father. Obviously his past interfered with his present and any progress he'd made with Bonnie. In the end, I liked that she stepped up to be there for him.The sex was scorching hot, but I also enjoyed the other aspects of their journey. There were only a couple of errors, but nothing major to dampen the reading experience. I was confused by one scene though (Ch.8).In his cabin, he first bent her over his desk. A few thrusts later he told her to get on her hands and knees, so both of them were facing the window.""She twisted with his arm and settled on her hands and knees on the desk.""More thrusting until: ""Dex lifted her hips until her feet left the floor...""Up to that point, nothing indicated she'd put her feet back on the floor.Regardless, thanks to this story, I'll be adding the other books in the Purgatory Club and Purgatory Masters series to my reading list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7EV8G5Q78RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEOEJ4Q#wasThisHelpful","RO7EV8G5Q78RA","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Purchased and read as part of [book:THE BAD BOYS OF EDEN: Billionaires, Alphas, Bikers, and Doms|24982395] Boxed Set.Part of a Series: (A Savage Interactive) Savage Tales #5Tags: Contemporary, Erotica, Divorced Heroine, Dirty-talking hero, Time TravelLength: 17 ChaptersI was a little confused by some of the reviews here mentioning the ""interactive"" aspect because there was none in the book that I read. A check on the author's website explained it. There are two editions of this book: First Edition is the Interactive one. The book in the Bad Boys of Eden Box Set (which I read) is the Second Edition, Non-Interactive.Tessa oozed confidence and sensuality. I enjoyed her first person POV because her ""voice"" throughout had a maturity and sophistication about it. Christophe may have been a billionaire (guessing here), but unlike most heroes of his ilk, he wasn't the brooding, mysterious type trying to lure an impressionable young woman with his status. The tension between them had a playful, flirtatious edge, like a game of cat and mouse. To me, they appeared to be on equal footing. Things got interesting once he mentioned how he knew her and told her about Tantra before they parted ways.Once on Eden, more strange things began to happen. People she'd never met before seemed to know her. Intriguing. Then she ran into Christophe and the games began anew with a bet. I was confused by their first scene. They'd had sex, but then the scene ended and changed to the next morning with her thinking ""He barely penetrated me. Barely touched me."" Um, what? There definitely was ""drilling"" and plunging and thrusting.Anyway, this story didn't just focus on the sex. One incident reminded me of the diving scene from Second Glances by Elena Aitken which I thought was kind of a happy coincidence if unintentional. It was nice to see them spend some time outside of the bedroom even if what they learned about one another was more tell than show.I'm not sure how I felt about the whole past self, future self time travel bit as it seemed somewhat out of place. I think the story would have still worked without it. The ending is a sort of HFN, maybe a little bit of a cliffhanger? I can't explain it. I really liked this hero and wish she would have ended up with him. At the time, I didn't know this was a series based on Tessa and her various adventures with a different man or men each time. If that's not something you're interested in, you may want to skip this. Otherwise, I'd say read this book and the rest of the series. Ms. St. Denis has a lovely writing ""voice"", and this story in particular wrapped around me like a heated blanket through Christophe's articulate and arousing dirty-talk and Tessa's responses.Errors: The inconsistency mentioned above, a few missing words and misspelled words.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KT08R5EFX1GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQMKG0U#wasThisHelpful","R3KT08R5EFX1GQ","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*Deep breath* Oh man‚Ä¶What sounded like a feel good, angst-free story was anything but. But first, don‚Äôt mistake this book for a BDSM story or even kinky. Yes, there was a bit of spanking, and the heroine liked it a little rough, and that was it. Other than that, it seemed pretty vanilla to me. At first, I thought this couple would dance around their attraction only to give in until feelings of more surfaced, and they‚Äôd have to decide whether they both wanted more than just sexy romps. While they did have that, Tiffany was a very troubled heroine, no thanks to her childhood.Tiffany (26) first came across as a sassy, fly by the seat of her pants kind of woman. She owned her sexuality. She knew what she liked but finding the right man to have it with seemed to elude her. The more we got inside her head, it turned out she had a whole slew of issues (and I don‚Äôt mean that in a mEan way). I felt badly for her, I really did. The type of abuse she‚Äôd suffered at the hands of her sick stepfather, the betrayal by her ex-boyfriend, and her quest to do better for herself by staying clear of bad boy types and looking for sophistication in a suit resulted in a bit of narrow-mindedness. Particularly heartbreaking were the instances of kindness from Declan only for her to reveal she‚Äôd never been on the receiving end of niceties. Men generally just used her and discarded her.Declan (31) was sweet, dominating, caring, sexy, and he actually managed to see through her defense mechanisms. I loved the times she tried to deflect from painful conversations with seduction only for him to turn her down without letting her feel rejected. He was pushy in a cocky, confident sort of way to get her to open up to him, but he could also take a back seat and just be there for her when she needed him.There were a few surprises that I didn‚Äôt really see coming: the secret she‚Äôd been keeping from him about a Halloween party two years prior, and Declan‚Äôs own family background. I thought those were pretty good twists to weave into this story considering Tiffany‚Äôs hangups. The suspense part wasn‚Äôt really a surprise. I figured that out right away. Despite the predictability, I‚Äôm glad it was added to give Tiffany a chance to fight back and put her ghosts to rest.The sex scenes were beyond hot! They didn‚Äôt overshadow the story, and they weren‚Äôt quick romps either. If Declan‚Äôs moves don‚Äôt melt your panties off‚Ä¶phew! I wouldn‚Äôt mind reading about Declan‚Äôs brother, Ryker. If he‚Äôs anything like his brother, then buckle up.*Complimentary copy provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJX5YQOLSGNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P041SBG#wasThisHelpful","R3UJX5YQOLSGNO","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read several anthologies from this publisher and have loved practically every single one of them.My complaint with this book was with the subtitle: Gothic Tales of Romance. Out of the 14 stories, perhaps only three stories could be classified as romance. The rest were erotica (not even erotic romance), and most stories had a HFN or no HEA at all. At least one of the protagonists from each story became a victim of circumstance - seduced only to pay a high price. The gothic part at least was fairly accurate - dark, edgy, sensual.The stories that stood out the most and were the most memorable (5 stars) were:Lightning in a Bottle by Kim Knox - Desperate to thwart her warlock uncle‚Äôs plan of offering his ward‚Äôs virginity in exchange for some precious metal, a young woman tries to beat him to the punch. She plans to give herself to one of her uncle‚Äôs finest creations, an automaton named Augustus. But he was more than he seemed to be.Oh yeeessss! This was exactly my kind of story. Hot, sensual, unexpectedly romantic.Devoured by Envy by Jo Wu - A beautiful maiden is as lonely as she is desperate for love, a lover at least. Just when she thought she found the one, he chose another. She would learn just how thoroughly envy would ruin her.I loved this story! A very sexy yet sad story.If the authors have more stories like the ones they contributed, I'd definitely read them.Other very good stories I felt were 4 or 4.5 star reads were:Sister Bessie‚Äôs Boys by Gary Earl Ross - A young man heads off to Bible College and is placed with a widow, Sister Bessie. His parents were hoping he‚Äôd be removed from temptation, but Sister Bessie teaches him lessons more valuable than just the pleasure of the flesh.The Dracula Club by Mitzi Szereto - A young Goth girl leaves her small town home and the bullies in search for like-minded people and a fresh start ‚Äì in Transylvania. From there, she basically does everything you‚Äôd tell your kids not to do.Moonfall by Rose de Fer - A woman is locked up in an insane asylum for sleepwalking followed by memory loss and displaying a heightened sexual appetite unbecoming of a lady. The men responsible for her imprisonment would learn to regret it.Zapada Alba by Tracey-Lander Garrett - A beautiful maiden lay in waiting, frozen, until her lover came to free her.Read my full review for each story on my blog or on GR.*Complimentary ARC provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2XB3RCH17YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE6QWIQ#wasThisHelpful","RU2XB3RCH17YP","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 4.5 out of 5Unlike the previous two books, this book began in the present with Wyatt and Tabitha's reunion. After that, it was broken up into parts, highlighting important milestones in this couples' lives. It was a very interesting way of telling the story that way rather than keeping them as adults and seeing their past in flashbacks. The book started out as adult, then went YA to NA and back to adult. I felt so much closer to them, and their journeys impacted me on a deeper level. The story also showed how Clay had become friends with the twins, and it even showed the friendship between Terry, Hal, Nova and Tabitha. Talk about surprising!Starting when they were eight, it was so cute to see Wyatt's infatuation with the shy girl whose only friend was Clay. Even as a child he was growly *laughs*. But holy crap, Tab's childhood broke my heart! I understood why she couldn't and wouldn't ask for help or accept it once her plight became known. I thought she would have a change of heart once she was old enough to live her own life, but by then I suspect her feelings towards her mother had been so ingrained in her, she didn't know how else to be. It was a little infuriating but sadly realistic. What really stood out was Wyatt unwavering infatuation that gradually morphed into love. He was sweet, cheeky, protective and he loved to pester her. The hardest part to read had to be that moment when everything fell apart - Tab's inability to stand up for herself, Wyatt's impatience (and understandable frustration and hurt) and the horrific fall-out that led to her disappearance for thirteen years.Don't expect this book to have MMA/UFC scenes (save for one very brief one) in it like the others. This book was all about the characters we'd come to know and love and the paths their lives had taken to shape them. If you don't mind a lot of angst, seeing children grow into adults and dealing with unpleasant things, and if you loved the other two books, then this will likely blow you away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JVRN221TVGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623007372#wasThisHelpful","R39JVRN221TVGN","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, it looks like Romeo and Juliet just blew Clay and Melody out of the water in terms of romance and suspense. After having read the first book in this series, and the first book in the spin-off series, it was nice to not feel lost at the mention of recurring characters in the crossovers. This was the best book in the MMA category I've read to date.Jules has always been one of my favorite characters. She was tough and outspoken in the first book, and nothing had changed. I loved how bold, confident, and feisty she was in regards to her blooming relationship with Romeo. The fact that she'd once been competitive in sports to make the US Olympic Team, she taught self-defense classes and worked as a lawyer and a deputy made her a force to be reckoned with. She was very open-minded and didn't really deny herself anything she wanted. The most appealing thing about her was her honesty, with herself and with Romeo.Romeo reminded me a lot of Marcos from The Viper, the first book in the Untamed Hearts series. Romeo had been sucked into a life he never wanted but couldn't escape unless he wanted to end up with a bullet in his head. The fact that his two younger brothers were in deep with the mafia caused him a lot of grief and heartache. It was heart-breaking to see him feel like just giving up a time or two. Every interaction with Jules was incredibly intense, and once he knew he'd fallen for her, I was elated that he didn't try to slink away ""for her own good"". You couldn't find two mature characters making adult decisions and respecting one another more than these two did, consistently.The chemistry between them went nuclear pretty much any time they could find some time alone. Each encounter was raw, rough, and highly erotic. My favorite scene had to be their sparring session. As a fan of martial arts movies and Asian spiritual influences, I loved the set-up to them getting physical, both sportively and sexually. It made my ovaries explode.But much like Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers, their path to love wasn't without complications. Add in the mafia and a shoot-out, and the ending was a nail-biter. Wyatt and Nova were surprisingly adorable at the end, and I look forward to their stories as well as Chuito's. I hope Tino grows up a bit more before his story comes around because like Wyatt pointed out, it really was like the Jersey Shore had descended on the them. I'd re-read this again in a heartbeat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QS4BFO7CBRGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623000068#wasThisHelpful","R2QS4BFO7CBRGI","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""He laughed without humor. She refused to date The Geek, but she‚Äôd do whatever The Wolf ordered.""This was another great, deliciously sexy read in the Once Upon a Dom series. Lucy‚Äôs story didn‚Äôt start where the first one left off. Instead, it took place parallel to the first book, but from Lucy and Graham‚Äôs POV. That approach was executed very well because huge chunks of Jaimie and Bryce‚Äôs story wasn‚Äôt used as filler (it was nice seeing them through this couple‚Äôs eyes though), and it made this readable as a standalone.I liked Lucy in the first book, and the way she nudged her best friend along to how protective she was of Jaimie. This time we got to see a different side of her. She was divorced, but her cheating ex-husband turned her off completely to geeky men. Even sexy ones. As we learned in book one, Lucy worked for Bryce, and Graham was the company VP. And a geek with a secret. There was a bit of backstory that established Graham and Lucy‚Äôs relationship, all the way down to the deception, quite believably.I loved the contrast between their interactions in the office and at the BDSM masquerade weekend. They were like night and day, to the point that Lucy toed the line of coming across as‚Ä¶mean. They didn‚Äôt waste time getting down to the point of the weekend, which means there was a lot of sex. They did talk, but that was told rather than shown. The scenes were all very hot, especially the one in the clearing that Jaimie had been privy to.Their only hurdle being that Graham didn‚Äôt know how to reveal himself to Lucy was left up until the very end. The big reveal didn‚Äôt go down like I thought it would. It was even better than I‚Äôd expected! I love Lucy, ha!So far I‚Äôm really digging this series. Don‚Äôt mistake this for a re-written fairytale with a BDSM twist though. It‚Äôs all role-playing, with hot sex, and a bit of drama thrown in for the characters to find their HEA.

"There were a lot of liars and lies floating around in this story. Revenant was bitter after learning the truth about his birth, Reaver, his mother, what they'd been forced to endure and his role in her death. This time we got the full scope of the machinations going on in both Heaven and Sheoul, and how our beloved characters had been used as pawns for the greater advantage. Heaven was blackmailing him and trying to screw him over, Satan was doing the same, Reaver and everyone else seemed to have given up on him or just flat out thought the worst of him, all except Blaspheme. He lived by rules and hated liars, with good reason. His attraction to Blas quickly gave way to more. She didn't treat him the way anyone else did, and she surprised him by making him feel needed. He'd never known comfort or trust except from his mother, until Blas.Blas had an equally tumultuous life, but at least her mother had always done what was best for her. Even though she had plenty of reasons to go into hiding and cower, she never let that stop her from helping others. She was a well-rounded heroine. Her subterfuge and consequent fear of being caught made her extremely cautious, but like I mentioned before, she still put others before herself. She was just so ""good"". I loved the way Rev and Blas interacted with one another. There were so many great moments of dialogue between them, from snarky to heartfelt, and a few times I was sobbing right along with her. The sex was quick and hot (limited to three scenes), and the story wasn't upstaged by the love scenes at all.What I enjoyed the most about this story was the tension created by Blaspheme's secret and knowing that Revenant would probably not react well if he learned about it any other way than from her. The plan to get rid of Gethel and subsequently Lucifer was still at the forefront. Despite a few hiccups along the way, there was a most satisfying ending. I hated one of the archangels from Reaver and Harvester's story. I think a lot of readers felt the same way, so they'll enjoy one scene in particular.I loved this story, especially the interesting conversation between Rev and Metatron at the end. We know that stopping the apocalypse from ever occurring is probably a pipe dream, so if the series ended here, it would be in a good place where everyone could be happy and loved.

"The second book in The Circle series had more suspense and deeper emotional turmoil for both characters than there was in the first book, and the plot promised a lot of intense sexual interaction between the main characters. I mean, could you pass up a story centered around a drug that throws a woman‚Äôs libido into overdrive. Does anyone remember Bella and Zsadist and the needing? Something like that, but not for the purpose of procreation.Honestly, I didn‚Äôt remember much of Marie‚Äôs (21) brief appearance in the first book, but her history with Ryker  (31/32) was mentioned many times, each time a little more of their horrible suffering was revealed throughout the story. I liked that despite those many years of abuse at Theo‚Äôs hands, she wasn‚Äôt a timid person who would jump at the sight of her own shadow. She wanted to do more, but she had to go through Ryker first. I admired her many shows of Having a backbone and telling Ryker off when he was being too overprotective. However, the downfall with most heroines like her (especially those in their early twenties), they bite off more than they can chew, and their overconfidence often lands them in trouble. Marie was sadly no different. My main problem with her was her selfishness. I understood why she pushed her way into every mission, but considering the drug in her system was a huge liability, I got mad every time the effects kicked in as soon as the missions had begun. Not only that, but her inexperience out in the field was another problem. She had only little training, and it showed every time. She even managed to get a few operatives killed because of a panic attack. Yup, not a fan of hers.Ryker on the other hand, he was the most interesting character of the two. He also had more issues to overcome. Theo had scooped him up after the death of his parents, fed him lies about his brother Collin, abused him and trained him to be a deadly assassin. Seeing him slowly come to terms with his past and work on putting it to rest with Marie‚Äôs help it what kept my interest. His history and friendship with Marie made him the natural choice to step up and help her with her ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. Interestingly, that was pretty one-sided because he had a darker side he tried to keep hidden from her. I thought his overprotectiveness of Marie was sweet, and judging from her bad choices throughout the story, she really needed protecting. Mostly from herself. He wasn‚Äôt always completely unreasonable, and more often than not, he caved to her. Personally, I liked the tortured hero angle and the darker side of his pleasure, although it wasn‚Äôt as bad as I‚Äôd been expecting (given all the hints about it).The plot was suspenseful with a couple of twists. Considering the catalyst for this story, I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn‚Äôt more sex than story. The first scene was definitely hot, but I ended up skipping a lot in the middle since they were all essentially the same ‚Äì oral sex because of his inability to climax, and he didn‚Äôt reveal his secret to her until near the end. I dislike heroines in their early twenties, and Marie was a good example of why I don‚Äôt like them. I wish she hadn‚Äôt always needed to be saved, but at least she acknowledged at the end that she wasn‚Äôt cut out for that job. I already have book three about Rex and Abby, and to be honest, I was hoping it would be Jack‚Äôs story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UIU8AT2PLU1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MAU2UO#wasThisHelpful","R3UIU8AT2PLU1I","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an elite assassin, Olivia (29) not only used her physical attributes to her advantage but also her feminine wiles. From the first chapter onwards, she was described as very sexual, not just as a means to relieve the tension from her job but also to take down any enemy. Collin also correctly assessed that she used sex as a means to cover up other insecurities or to deflect. On the outside she was tough, mouthy, unapologetic. But deep down, she never gave up the dream of finding someone who could love her and have her back.Collin (30+) was a sexy jerk for most of the story, but I kind of liked that about him. He didn‚Äôt know how to act differently, nor had he had any prior experience with deeper emotions. Heck, even by the end it was like pulling teeth to get an ILY out of him. With that in mind, his feelings of lust, mistrust but also being intrigued by her were believable. As the leader of The Onyx Scepter, his utmost priority was the safety of his people. But he was generally kind to anyone who deserved it, including Olivia. That didn‚Äôt stop him from being cautious around her.Olivia and Collin weren‚Äôt your typical romantic couple but they did have chemistry. Despite very different upbringings, neither of them really knew how to love or express feelings at all. With that said, a part of me really liked the emotional angst, the somewhat callous approach to their blossoming relationship, and the distrust everyone showed towards Olivia, pretty much up until the very end of the story. Some perverse part of me enjoyed seeing Olivia‚Äôs attempts to get Collin to sleep with her fail time and time again, and I enjoyed Collin‚Äôs hot and cold treatment of her. It almost seemed like a game between them ‚Äì trying to get the enemy to cave first. His behavior wasn‚Äôt exactly hero material, but it was both true to his character, and it prompted the change in Olivia. Despite his constant rebuffs, she continued to help The OS where she could and unfortunately the distrust towards her continued.He was intrigued by her different sides, he admired her capabilities and other assets, but he was horrible for making her feel like a pawn in the tug of war with The Circle, and also for making her feel unlovable. His willpower to not have sex with her was amusing most of the time, but once even that was out of the way, he often acted like she meant nothing to him. The sex was always hot with a raw, rough edge that suited their characters and lifestyle. I liked seeing Olivia fend for herself especially in the end.

"I love my keyboard silicone skin! I recently got a Macbook Pro 13"" and wanted to protect the keys. I have to dust off my keyboard every day because my dogs shed like crazy. Dust and dog hairs get everywhere, and I didn't want them getting under the keys. This is the perfect solution. It's an even better solution than those fancy stickers for keyboard customization. This just lays on the keys, it can be easily washed, and if you had a few different colors, you can swap them out without having to commit.The keyboard backlight will be a little muted but not by much. If you have long nails, then typing is still easy, if not more comfortable. If you're the type to drink near your laptop, this won't save your keyboard if you have a large spill. Liquid could still seep under the silicone, just a heads up. I highly recommend this product, and I will definitely be getting one or two more other colors. I got the dark blue, but with the black keys underneath, it comes of more like a deep purple, which is what I was really hoping for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQ74080YABFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LF7EBO8#wasThisHelpful","R1VQ74080YABFY","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 4.5 out of 5I‚Äôve waited three years for Torin‚Äôs story, never quite sure why I was so drawn to him. Perhaps it began with the pity. Forced to keep a safe distance from his closest friends, always being left behind during battles for the safety of everyone involved, to never being able to share a deeper connection with a female, well, he had me rooting for his story for years, and I wasn‚Äôt the least bit disappointed.Keeleycael aka The Red Queen was one hell of a female. Every living creature feared her, with good reason. There was a lot of talk about spilling organs, eating hearts and ripping out spines. All in a days work for Keeley. Her past wasn‚Äôt that of pampered royalty, far from it. She was a firecracker though, I loved her all the more for it. She often took things quite literally, which led to some hilarious conversations.It was nice to finally get the full scoop on Torin, both the man and a warrior. The fact that he was a virgin was both a surprise and yet it wasn‚Äôt, but it made him even more endearing as the story progressed. He‚Äôd carried a lot of guilt for being responsible for the death of two women, all because his desire to know touch had been so overwhelming. This story had a lot more of that where Keeley was concerned, but I enjoyed how it pushed both of them to move forward despite several setbacks.As a couple, these two were a little helpless in terms of social skills, but they‚Äôd both been denied the chance to discover how that game was played in the past. Seeing them bumble their way through lust, affection, compassion, and love was often hilarious and heartbreaking. They had both starved for affection and longed someone who loved them. Their little skirmishes were like an intense form of foreplay. I loved the effect they had on one another, all the time. What fueled her lust more than anything was the fact that he was utterly unafraid of her and her powers. They could make each other laugh, and they talked often, openly. The more he showed his caring, protective side, the more she wanted to jump his bones. Preferably skin on (hey, with her you never knew). Needless to say, they had amazing chemistry, and their journey to a HEA was quite tumultuous. The lovemaking was obviously inventive, and a very slow burn until the end of the book. But when they finally did the deed, wow!What would a LotU book be without the side stories? Baden, Cronus, Rhea and Pandora were all together and carrying on like they were on an episode of Survivor. Alliances are made, broken, reformed, and they bickered. A lot. But the pairing of Cameo and Lazarus had me wanting more. Talk about flying sparks!FTC: Complimentary copy provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZVBVMJ0WNDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0XO2NM#wasThisHelpful","R2PZVBVMJ0WNDG","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked Nikki, but my feelings for her throughout the story would end up looking like a sinus curve. In the beginning, I liked her vulnerability and seeing her at her lowest point. I was able to get a good feel for her character ‚Äì cynical, lonely, crappy job, no father, estranged from her mother and a screw up for a sister. There was no mention of any friends or close ties to anyone or anything where she called home. In her personal life, she‚Äôd made numerous mistakes, six in total according to her. The last one was the most devastating. She‚Äôd been dating Clint for six months before she found out he had a wife and kids. When she met Wade, she acknowledged their instant and intense connection and chemistry, but learning to trust him ended up being the major hurdle of this story.Wade. Sigh. I want him in the worst way. That charmingly sexy cowboy lawyer was pretty much the perfect male specimen. While he‚Äôd been dealt his fair share of disappointment in his love life, which also damaged his relationship with his brother Dirk, he did want to fall in love again and settle down. I loved his cheeky side the most. He was so good at making her feel at ease, lowering her defenses and making her laugh.This couple had undeniable chemistry, and not all of it was purely sexual. Nikki managed to open up to Wade about her past, and when she didn‚Äôt think she needed comfort, he was always there for her. There were a few sexy times before their first time at the halfway point. Despite the amazing sex they shared, Nikki was of two minds about where they were headed, and her fear lasted up until around the 91% point. Their last sex scene broke my heart because it underscored the hurt, anger and frustration they were both feeling. My heart broke for them in that moment because they were both at fault and responsible for the impossible ultimatum. I was frustrated with her, but I understood the importance of their separation for a few months. The indecision, the heartache, the realizations, were all worth the wait for the ending. The person who made the first move towards reconciliation was perfectly chosen and executed. I look forward to grabbing a copy for myself and eagerly await the next book in this series.*Complimentary copy provided via NetGalley for the purpose of an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KCSU1K79492/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492601128#wasThisHelpful","R39KCSU1K79492","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3.5/5I've read and loved all books written by Jerrie Alexander. She's one of my go-to authors when I need a romantic suspense fix. This first book in her new series just didn't grab me as much as any of her other works. While the main characters didn't keep me captivated, I was definitely interested in the side characters, Colton and Luke.I love that the author often starts of her stories with a glimpse into the villain's mind and his or her grizzly deeds. It accomplishes two things: it sucks me in and sets the tone for the suspense portion. I enjoyed the plot of having the hero return to his hometown only to get embroiled in the heroine's troubles and become both her ally and her lover. Erin's childhood made me feel sympathetic towards her, and she had some moments where she imparted some good advice to Rafe showing she had compassion, but that's where my interest in her as a character ended. Rafe was a little more fleshed out to make him interesting. I liked his very male, protective side, and I understood why he had no interest in a relationship.Between the two of them, I just didn't feel the chemistry. Back in high-school, they weren't exactly friends. His father and her adoptive father had been best friends, she was the messed up girl, and he was the football hero. In an effort to be nice, he'd asked her to prom. That blew up in their faces over a silly misunderstanding. They hadn't seen or spoken to one another in twelve years when they met again, and right away they were having x-rated fantasies about one another. Considering she'd held on to the past hurt for twelve years, their insta-lust was a little too sudden. I felt I was being told about their feelings rather than being shown.The suspense portions were the best parts of this book. The villain's POV kept things interesting since I kept trying to read between the lines for clues. Erin managed to help herself without needing her knight in shining armor, which I appreciated. Even though this book didn't quite do it for me, the brief glimpses of Luke (Rafe's younger, Army Ranger brother) and Colton (Rafe's partner) were enough to capture my interest, and I'd love to read more about them.*Review copy provided by Book Partners in Crime Promotions for the purpose of an honest review.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JG1P324VK592/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941205054#wasThisHelpful","R2JG1P324VK592","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this story about a jaded Dom and his younger submissive who still had a life to discover and dreams to make a reality. That type of struggle was believable and relatable. The story started in the present with Khari and Marcus in their third month of dating. Flashbacks throughout the story showed how they‚Äôd met and eventually became D/s.I liked that Khari was bold enough to explore her kinky side and open her heart to the possibility of love, but she was also smart to question his intentions when after months of playing together, she‚Äôd never been invited into his personal space. While it was sweet of him to not want to stand in the way of her dreams, as a Dom, I was a little surprised that he didn‚Äôt pick up on some of her conflicting emotions, nor did he tell her where she stood. As far as honesty in a D/s relationship, her eyes were finally opened when she realized he‚Äôd cleverly avoided answering any personal questions.The story took a bit of a nosedive for me with the misunderstanding that drove them apart. Creating a problem that could have easily been solved by simply talking to one another is a big pet peeve of mine. On top of that, she decided to tuck tail and run, not returning his calls or texts. That really was a little childish regardless of whether or not her heart had been crushed. Marcus wasn‚Äôt much better in that regard. He kept waffling between wanting to go after her and letting her go for her own good. At least he was clever enough to figure out where things had gone wrong, and he did everything he could to make things right. Brownie points for Marcus. Ultimately, I have to concede that their six, seven month separation had been for the best. It allowed Khari to have her dream and decide that she could have it all if she were open to the idea. The only downside to that separation was the zero character interaction. Seeing them go about their lives for nearly a year slowed the story down.Overall I did enjoy their struggle to find themselves and make a relationship work. A little less repetition about his hatred for his ex-wife and what she‚Äôd done to him would have been nice. Khari‚Äôs behavior at the end still showed a lack of maturity with her infuriating behavior. Marcus made the first move, but even after realizing that she wanted him in her life and planned to tell him, she kept saying hurtful things and lying to push him away (while her thoughts screamed at her to shut up). Playing games and expecting the man to be a mind reader is not a trait I‚Äôm particularly fond of. Regardless, I would read the next book in the series and hope for a less immature heroine.*Complimentary copy provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U81LUUCDK5VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHO2GZU#wasThisHelpful","R2U81LUUCDK5VX","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elena Arcos hadn't really been living. If it hadn't been for her getting shot during a convenience store robbery, she may have never faced that epiphany head on. Not much was revealed about her life before all the paranormal activity. She had no family except for her Aunt Uza, she worked in a research lab in hematology, she'd had one serious relationship and apparently no friends or anyone close enough to check up on her. She handled the craziness happening around her and to her surprisingly well. I liked her feistiness and growth throughout the story.Nikolai Itzov, Descendant of Azrael and a Slayer wasn't exactly kind towards Elena in the beginning until he realized who she was to him. I liked all the different sides to his character and his development. From not wanting to fall for Elena but not being able to help himself. And the nice thing was, it didn't happen in an instant just because he found out she was his mate. It happened gradually with a lot of ups and downs. One of his sweetest traits was trying to help her figure out who and what she was. Then there were the revelations that he'd misjudged those closest to him and trying to find ways to make amends.I liked their (sexual) chemistry, and it didn't overpower the story. The sex scenes weren't plentiful or thrown in as filler. They had the right amount of heat (with biting) to keep my interest and not feel like I wanted to skip them. Elena had a tough task of getting Nikolai to ease up on his alpha male protectiveness, but she handled him well. I also enjoyed the times when she stepped up to the plate and had to save him.I loved all the side characters in this story. Aunt Uza was so whacky she was funny. She reminded me a little of Nix from Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark. Stefan, the Time Folder, was a great character because he loved to rile up Nikolai whenever he could. Also, the set-up for his story and his fated mate was interesting and the consequences of their union. I really want to read Vlad's story though. He was dangerously sexy and I wonder if him and Aleksandra could be...maybe....I need to know! Aleksandra got nicer as the story went on, though I did have my doubts about her. The situation between her, her mother and Fydor made me a little squeamish though, especially once the relations dawned on me).Love Me to Death left me with a very promising first impression. It was fast-paced, had interesting characters, humor, very good suspense and action, a few surprises, but above all it was very entertaining. A few things didn't add up for me, but this was a great start to a new series. I definitely want to follow up with the next book.*Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for the purpose of an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1WYL2EQGPBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWUXU3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1L1WYL2EQGPBS","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was happy with the speedy delivery of this brush set. Each brush came individually wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve. As soon as I removed them, all four ferrules fell off the handles. While disappointing, it wasn't that big of a deal. I just glued them all back on. Some reviewers mentioned a smell and no shedding. I had the opposite experience.I've had my brushes for five months now. For the price, they're a very good deal. After a couple of washes though they have begun to shed. They don't shed like crazy, but I do have to pluck out hairs before a makeup application so they don't end up stuck to my foundation, etc. And I use the Benjabelle brush tree to dry them so water in the ferrule isn't the issue.Overall, they're good brushes, and I'd recommend them for beginners. I use them mainly for blush, bronzer or powder foundation. But for liquid foundation I prefer my Sigma F80 or the MakeUp Geek buffing brush.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMPFWE44VLV8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BX7DGIC#wasThisHelpful","RMPFWE44VLV8Y","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating 4.5/5Exhilarating. That's the only word that comes to mind to describe Shooting Scars. This time you'll either still like Ellie or (really) dislike her for her choices. I'm not gonna lie (I got why she did it) but I was crushed when she did that thing she did (him). Ellie was still the same woman with so many different layers and nuances which what made her such a compelling heroine. Although all the male characters argued the points of her being either good or bad, I really felt that she was a good person at her core, but driven to do things out of fear or because she'd been manipulated and allowed the past to cloud her judgment.We got to see more of Camden's underlying dark side. With a flashback or two to their past, we saw that he was capable of violence whenever he felt he needed to defend Ellie's honor. Once he committed to going after Ellie and teamed up with Gus, we saw what the nerdy tattoo artist was really capable of. In short, I think where Ellie is concerned, he's willing to do stupid things. But the soft side of him, when it does show, it makes you want to root for him even more.I'm not sure how I felt about Javier as an (anti) hero. The veiled claims of loving her were too shrouded in his agenda, both past and present. He was a sexy devil in the intimate scenes with Ellie. But outside of that, it was difficult to gauge his sincerity. One minute he would show signs that he had a soul or a conscience, and the next minute he would turn on the impassiveness.Looking at the bigger picture, I'm not as convinced anymore that what Travis did to her leg warrants the lengths she was going to and the sacrifices she was willing to make just to get revenge. I just felt her parents were more to blame more than anyone, and yet she still cared for them. After all the hurt and betrayal, she wanted to help her mother? Strangely, Javier and Camden had lost much more.Loved the suspense in this one and the emotional tailspin all three of these characters went through. I have a theory about Gus, so I can't wait to find out if I'm right. Now that the three of them will have to work together towards a common goal, I wonder how they'll handle the love triangle situation. I'm deducting half a point on behalf of Camden because yeah, that scene broke my heart a little as well. At this point, I'm still Team Camden.*Complimentary ARC of the paperback to be published Oct 2014 for the purpose of an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R389IBDZEQ6S6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG8ZY7W#wasThisHelpful","R389IBDZEQ6S6B","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3.5/5I'm not Catholic, so I wasn't shocked about some of the things I read in this book. It's not the first time I've read a book with, should I say, blasphemous acts. This story is also chock-full of religious references and overtones. If you find any of those things offensive or off-putting, this book is not going to be your cup of tea. As a whole, I enjoyed the story and the suspense, but I struggled to like or understand the heroine.I wasn't sure what to expect when I began reading this...perhaps something along the lines of more mainstream PNR involving angels but with a darker edge. Instead, I found myself thinking of Dan Brown books mixed with paranormal, erotic romance. The beginning of this book was interesting, starting with the fall of Azazel and the backstory on Milja, her first encounter with her father's prisoner, and her own fall from grace that led to her being sent away from her small village in Montenegro to the United States.It was somewhat difficult to connect with Milja, not just because of her age (23), but I also had a hard time picturing her. She was just sort of a non-descript female. Also, on the one hand, she'd been adventurous and engaged to a man her family hadn't approved of (from a religious standpoint), and on the other hand she fell back on her religious roots (quoting religious scriptures) when she felt scared or cornered. Another thing that was slightly off-putting about her was the fact that she was always completely helpless. She tumbled from one bad situation into another, and if she wasn't being rescued by Azazel, or Egan, then it was Uriel.Azazel was supposed to be evil for he had married a human woman and had children. Seduction and giving man the ability to forge metal (which made weapons which caused wars) were also attributed to him. From an outside point of view, I didn't see him as evil. To me, evil was the manner in which he'd been captured and bound. Evil were the Orthodox priests who went to any lengths to recapture him. Including torture and murder.The dark romance was pretty hot. Azazel mostly made appearances in Milja's erotic dreams where she submitted to him and her fantasies of being watched in a variety of settings played out. Although two out of the three characters were meant to end up together, there wasn't any romantic chemistry to speak of. It was mostly her compassion driving her to defend him time and time again, and I felt he chose her because of that. The climax was gory and full of suspense. I couldn't tell if the ending was as ominous as it sounded, but perhaps it was a setup for more to come. I would read more from this author because the prose was actually quite lovely.*Complimentary copy provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7S33SLXEIDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB637BE#wasThisHelpful","R1D7S33SLXEIDV","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my series review post of books 1-6, please visit my blog: http://wp.me/p4SVFG-2fxHer Demonic Angel was my absolute FAVORITE in this series, oh my Hell! I would highly recommend reading Her Guardian Angel first as these two were heavily entwined. Plus, it just adds to the reading experience. The events in this book took place eighteen months after Her Guardian Angel with Amelia asking Veiron to help rescue her sister, Erin, from Hell. As is the startling events and revelations from the last book weren't enough, this one had even more. Oh, and Veiron was to die for!Veiron was the perfect hero ‚Äì a bad boy,  protective, a gentleman/demon, he wasn't afraid of showing the more vulnerable sides of himself, and he had a great sense of humor. Despite the gruff exterior, and his vow to leave her as soon as she was reunited with Amelia, for her own safety, he couldn't resist the (com)passion she offered so freely and unconditionally.Erin appealed to me right from the beginning. Despite being thrust right into the heart of danger, she managed to act brave instead of showing fear, she was spunky, open-minded, bold, and her captivity by demons didn't quell her desire for Veiron.Together, they made one fine couple. While she desired him, I enjoyed seeing the effects she was having on Veiron, how she upended his bleak existence. She reasoned things out and was able to see past the demon exterior to the man beneath. One scene in particular was oh so sweet, and that moment formed the foundation of their future relationship.Now, on to Amelia. What the hell happened to her? I was shocked by her complete change in attitude towards Veiron, especially the animosity. After all, at the end of HGA, he'd come to her and Marcus' rescue giving her precious time to get Marcus to safety. And it seemed she liked him enough to ask for his help at the beginning of this book. The sudden hatred was more than just seeing her little sister hook up with a demon. She was bossy, unfair, judgmental. I didn't like or understand her. Veiron didn't feel accepted, and his pain was palpable. But thank goodness for Erin, who stood up for him time and time again.Not everything was romance and sunshine though. Erin had to face the toughest battle yet, not for her life, but for love. A devastating truth was revealed to her, and a shocking turn of events led to quite a long and heart-wrenching trial. Great dialogue, characters the reader could root for, and plenty of suspense and action made this book the most thrilling so far. All that heartache and despair made the HEA well-worth the ride on the emotional roller coaster.*Complimentary review copy provided for the purpose of an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7UQI8CGKOEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00995OSTQ#wasThisHelpful","RM7UQI8CGKOEI","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 4.5/5For my series review post of books 1-6, please visit my blog: http://wp.me/p4SVFG-2fxIn my opinion, this is where the series really takes off, in the best possible way. The plot, wow! What the previous three books may have lacked in creativity, this new story blew the rest out of the water. There were quite a few unexpected twists, surprises, even tears. The main characters, their journey, and their sacrifices were so riveting that for a few hours, they had my undivided attention.Marcus was fiercely devoted to his duty, Heaven and obeying orders. Once he revealed himself to Amelia, his inner struggle between duty and desire was always palpable in the things he said and the way he acted. He seemed to run hot and cold a lot, and the reason may have had to do with the fact that he was not only a devoted Angel, but also a virgin. He‚Äôd never been in love, but he seemed to know what lust was.I really liked Amelia because she was another mature heroine, and she was bold. Her string of bad luck with men didn‚Äôt stop her from acknowledging her attraction to Marcus, nor did it stop her from acting on it. As the story unfolded, she learned to stand up for herself and became braver in all aspects of her life ‚Äì from embracing her budding relationship with Marcus, to embracing her incredible destiny.Unlike the previous books, the romance was a slow burn. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the more drawn out journey from being acquaintances to friends to lovers. They progressed naturally while coming to terms with their new fates, and they communicated well. It was because of that slow burn that I was completely invested in this couple, so when something terrible happened (I didn‚Äôt see coming), I was not only shocked but the aftermath made me shed some tears.The story drove the romance instead of the other way around which was refreshing. It had enough sex for those who love those moments of fiery passion and intimacy, and more than enough excitement, action to keep suspense lovers happy. Past couples made an appearance, and Apollyon played a major role in this one. In some aspects, from this book forward, the deadly game between Heaven and Hell was reminiscent of the games the Gods from Greek mythology liked to play, using their people as pawns, causing pain and destruction regardless of consequences. Well, all the players were finally on to the wicked games and they weren‚Äôt going to stand for it. Alliances and new friendships were formed, the seemingly unredeemable characters were good for a few surprises and for the first time, this author made a box of tissues necessary to make it through her book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ9G98E64MHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EUJIG8#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ9G98E64MHM","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 4/5For my series review post of books 1-6, please visit my blog: http://wp.me/p4SVFG-2fxThe series finally picked up steam with more action, and I really liked this pairing because the heroine was not only a hunter, but she was also part demon. So if you enjoy stories where lovers belong on opposing sides, then you‚Äôll like this.I really enjoyed the way these two characters were introduced to each other, and the fact that Einar got to watch Taylor kick, flip and slash her way through some demons was pretty hot.Einar was very confident and sweet. It was nice that he had figured out her secret from the beginning and left her thinking she had managed to hide it from him well until the end. It made all his words and actions appear more sincere.Taylor was a great fighter, and she didn‚Äôt take a back seat to all the great fights nor did Einar try too hard to curb her abilities as a means of protecting her. The mutual attraction didn‚Äôt make her any less equal to him outside of the romance which was nice to see. The only signs of vulnerability she ever showed had to do with her heritage and she seemed to put him before her own wants. I loved the confidence of this couple; there was very little hem-hawing about the course of their relationship. They simply allowed things to progress naturally. Einar‚Äôs little speech about why he loved her and why he chose her despite their differences made him so loveable.We were introduced to a new character, a vampire named Villandry. Not much about him was revealed other than he and Taylor had once been lovers. That created some interesting tension between the three. The plot that began in book two was wrapped up at the end. Overall, there was a nice balance of action and romance. Familiar couples made appearances which went a long way in helping Einar and Taylor feel more optimistic about having a future together.*Complimentary review copy provided for the purpose of an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111WXFWZADA6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CFAS06#wasThisHelpful","R111WXFWZADA6G","A29K289KUTT08W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29K289KUTT08W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever wonder what it was like to live in Italy before and during WWII?  This book gives the best idea I've come across, probably because the author based it all on her own family's experiences and accounts of other people they knew personally.Francesco's Song is only lightly fictionalized, so the truth shines through about the author's father, Francesco, and her mother, Francesca.  They were children near Bari in Italy's south when Mussolini and his black shirted Fascists came to power.The brainwashing of the children began early, and the Fascists worked hard to build a cult around their leader, Benito Mussolini.  It is interesting to see that the older people were often more skeptical of the political bombast.""By 1929, when Italy was having its love affair with Il Duce, Francesco was eight years old.""Because the story follows her parents, and Italy, from 1928 through to the post war era, we get to see how the children grew up to see the harsh reality of their leaders' militarism.  They were left with great skepticism of any political leadership and any -ism.Francesco is the main person we follow from a Fascism inculcated childhood in a household run most of the time by his mother, a white widow, as the neighbors called a woman whose husband spent most of the year abroad to earn a living.""So many men in town had left.  Some had gone to South America, to cities in Argentina and Brazil, but Francesco's father had gone, like so many others, to New York City.""We go with Francesco to young adulthood when he falls in love with Francesca.  That is when we pick up her story, and learn that she struggles more under the paternalistic traditions of Italy, and especially of southern Italy.  As her mother says:""You'll get married and you'll have a family.  What do you need school for?""Marriage comes young for a woman in that sort of society.""At eighteen years of age, Francesca had already received marriage proposals from several suitors who had sent go-betweens to her mother's house.""Then comes Francesco's required military service.  Like all clever young men, he chose his branch of the military just before getting drafted, so he served in the prestigious Carabinieri Reali.That brought him to Dobrovna, Yugoslavia, where fought and suffered from the violence, with traces of that suffering trailing him all his life long.  The life of the soldier is well described.  The author makes good use of her father's letters to his fidanzata in this section of the book.The post war period is interesting for the cultural frustration Francesco suffered when he returned to the very socially and religiously repressive south of Italy.  Like all people who've spent time away from a repressive society, or who enjoyed some relief from it, like Francesca during the difficult war years, it was impossible to be happy back in that environment.""Once away from the small universe of his childhood, his eyes had been opened and now he was not so quick to accept what had once seemed carved in stone.  This was true especially regarding the church...""That's when the choice came to go either to the north of Italy, or abroad.  Since both of them had fathers and even a sibling in the United States already for years, their emigration to America was simpler than trying to find a good job anywhere in Italy.The description of how looking for work in Italy operated in the 1950s  rings true with my experiences when living there in the 1980s.  Exams, competitions, recommendations, friends of friends needed, political juice...  What I hear from friends in Italy, the situation has still not improved much, and it still pushes talented young Italian to emigrate.The story is told in the classic omniscient narrative style, but it is done with a light touch, and at times the author limits the point of view of the narration to just one character.  It is a wonderful choice for this story.  It lets us get to know so many interesting people intimately.Don't worry if you are not up on your WWII history.  The author fills the reader in on what he needs to know along the way.  The result is a very personal story that also has a wide appeal.Francesco and Francesca's story is theirs, and it is also the story of thousands of other Italians who chose to leave Italy after WWII.  If you have relatives among the Italian diaspora of that era and age, reading this book is a good way of connecting with their experiences.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"I was lucky enough to get an review-copy of this book. I've read the others in the series, so I really wanted to keep up with the characters. It was a fun mystery, and the bigger story of her family continues. I don't like to say too much in reviews of mystery books, because there is the risk of giving clues and things away, so I'll just say that if you like cozy mysteries, you should like this book and this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0Q6K7XU36JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0181DH8VQ#wasThisHelpful","RA0Q6K7XU36JS","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella, set on Stromboli, the volcano/island off the coast of Sicily, is the 13th Christmas novella by this well-known writer of historical crime fiction.  She uses minor characters from her Thomas Monk Victorian Mystery Series as the protagonists of her Christmas novellas.The protagonist of A Christmas Escape she uses the forty-something brother, Charles, of the female partner, Harriet, of her Monk series.  The story is told from his perspective in 3rd person limited narrative style.  He is a widower who feels like a failure in life, so he seeks to spend Christmas away from friends and family, on the remote island.""...the huge looming mountain, the arch of the sky, which was already darkening in the east.  The fire of sunset in the west was painting the sea with color.  A faint wind stirred, carrying the scent of grasses.""During the time of the British empire, no place was ever remote enough to escape British tourists, and so it is on Stromboli.  Charles is booked at an inn that is chock full of Brits.  They make up the cast of potential victims and perpetrators of crimes, along with the local owner of the country inn, a la Agatha Christie.The historical novella offers some mystery, some hope to characters who'd lost hope, and a battle of good verses evil that ends on Christmas Day, with an erupting Stromboli in the background, and threateningly in the foreground, too.  It also offers lots of deaths, too many deaths for my taste in a Christmas book, but that may bother other readers less, especially if they are regular readers of the author's Christmas novellas.Although the story is set in late 1800s, oddly we are never told this in the book or in the book's description.  There is no dateline at the beginning of the story.  Only one of the two covers used for the book shows minuscule, easy to miss figures in historical dress.  Stromboli is still remote, making it timeless, so the mention of a boat to get there, and the rural character of the place does not indicate the era.  Tourists still leave London for the continent in trains, so that is no clue, either.It is only one quarter of a way into the story, when the author mentions the misogynistic marriage laws of Britain that put a wife's property under her husband's control, that we get a hint at the era that is the setting for the story.  I would have appreciated knowing a little more about Charles, since I'm not a reader of the author's historical crime series, and this is my first meeting with the character.I enjoyed the Daphne du Maurier feeling that came through at times when the put upon women were described.  The mountain setting was also a reminder of du Maurier, who often used that setting in her very entertaining short stories and novellas.  What this book was missing, that du Maurier never omitted, was the sexual subtext.  There is no sex or sexual subtext at all in this book, which hurt the believability of it for me.  It is unnaturally chaste.When an aging man is drawn to a nubile young woman, and the young woman's aging protector hands her over into the care of the other man, a perfect stranger, there should be some consideration or suggestion of sexuality, or at least the potential for sexual abuse of the vulnerable young woman.  British gentlemen of that era were infamous for their sexual abuse of vulnerable young women.  That part of the story felt odd to me, to say the least.The writing is fluid and confident.  The story is interesting.  Fans of these Christmas novellas will not be disappointed, I suspect.  It is a clean adventure novella set in the late 1800s on Stromboli, one of Italy's volcanic islands.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"The subtitle of this non-fiction book is The Untold Story of Luigi Del Bianco.  The journalist-author sets out to ""correct an egregious injustice"" and to get for the Italian-American stonemason/sculptor, who was the Chief Carver on the Mt. Rushmore project from 1933-40, the ""kudos"" which he ""rightfully and richly"" deserves.It is a commendable goal, and the story of that struggle by the author and the man's family continues beyond this book, with progress being made each day.The author presents his case well, with help from the Del Bianco family's research among the papers of Gutzon Borglum, the Master Sculptor of the Mr. Rushmore project, in the Library of Congress, where Borglum praises his Chief Carver above all the other people on the project, stressing Luigi Del Bianco's importance to the project's artistic success.Many fascinating interviews, correspondence, facts and varied background information collected by the author provide a broad picture for the reader of who Luigi Del Bianco was, what he did, and why he and other Chief Carvers have not been included in the story of Mr. Rushmore written by other authors and the park service, which manages the site.Like many Italian immigrants who contributed significantly to their new countries, Luigi Del Bianco is recognized in his hometown in Italy.  The story of Italian stonemasons and sculptors who emigrated to America could fill a whole book by itself.The author does a good job telling the reader about where those men came from in Italy, where they often went to in America, and what they accomplished in their new country.  An immigrant journey to a new life is, as always, a fascinating one.""History has not treated Luigi Del Bianco very kindly.""No, it hasn't.So, why have the Chief Carvers of Mt. Rushmore been put in the back seat very far behind the Master Carver Gutzon Borglum?  There are many reasons, mainly valid ones, for that, since the Master (Maestro) Artisan always takes full credit for art created with the help of apprentices.Why has Luigi Del Bianco been written out of the history of Mt. Rushmore, even in books purporting to be about the team behind the Master Carver?  There are more complex reasons for that, into which the author bravely delves.Real history is usually ugly, and for that reason people tend to clean it up for modern consumption, through the romanticization of it, the editing of it, and even the obliteration of it.  There is much ugliness in the real history of the Mt. Rushmore project.  The romanticization, editing and erasure of history has happened there by the wagon-load.The carved mountain face was conceived by the Ku Klux Klan leader Borglum to be a piece of monumental art dedicated to the Manifest Destiny nonsense U.S. politicians and businessmen invented to validate their greedy push to take all the territory between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Borglum fought to have Teddy Roosevelt included on the rock face, because Roosevelt was a hero for many greedy businessmen, who saw President Roosevelt as a man who would extend U.S. Manifest Destiny to lands beyond the North American continent, to create a U.S. Empire.The Mt. Rushmore project began in South Dakota just when the Klan, which had been revived to fight immigration, especially of Catholics, and even more specifically of Italian Catholics, had been elected to offices throughout the western states.Luigi Del Bianco, a U.S. citizen since 1928, and his family, moved there at precisely that time, and they suffered bigotry and ostracism from the white local residents and many of the local workmen on the Mt. Rushmore project.As you can imagine, many locals wouldn't want to wash their dirty linen in public, especially when that linen contained a pointed hood.  If they were to give Luigi Del Bianco his due in the project, the evil, bullying treatment he and his family received would have to be recognized as well, along with the Klan's history in South Dakota.The Del Biancos found friends in the local Native Americans, who welcomed the family who was ostracized just as they were.  That too would have to be recognized if Luigi Del Bianco were written back into the history of Mt. Rushmore.Of course, that would bring up the upsetting history of Mt. Rushmore being a holy site for the Natives, that was cruelly defaced with the representations of four people who symbolically represented the centuries long massacre of Native Americans.From the late 1400s to the late 1800s, 20 million Native Americans died from disease, war and starvation.  If that were put in modern terms, in relation to the population at the time of the massacre, it would be as if 92 million people were killed today to free up land.As a side note, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which occurred over the same period, took 18 million lives, which in today's terms would be 83 million lives.  That is an awful lot of death for one nation to have on its conscience, so it is no wonder that the ugly truths of that history have so often been romanticized, edited, and obliterated.Some strides have been taken very recently to put the real history back into the flag-waving, rah-rah monument, the so-called Shrine to Democracy, that Mt. Rushmore was made into for the modern car-tourism era, obliterating some ugly history so the locals and the Federal Government could earn some money.  That is commendable.The author of this book aims to have more strides made, more quickly, and that is commendable too.  With the family's help, and the help of many Italian-American organizations, and with some politicians, and some park service employees, it may come to happen.  This book is part of that effort.On another level, the book presents an intelligent study of the three forms of human response to threats of change to their romanticized, edited and obliterated histories:wonderfully enlightened cooperation,self-serving co-opting of the issue, anddogged obstructionism involving passive ostracism and active hostility.If you are interested in more about Luigi Del Bianco and his family's experiences in South Dakota, his grandson has written a book ""In the Shadow of the Mountain: Luigi's Story"".Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"This novel has elements of family drama, bloody horror, mystery and history.  Half of the novel is set in the past, during WWII in Venice, Italy.  What starts the story off is the purchase of a piece of hand-written sheet music for a waltz, in a store in Rome, Italy, by the musician protagonist, Julia, in the present day.  Her present day life becomes altered, and she is certain the sheet music is to blame.We then switch to the past, and meet the man who will ultimately compose the musical piece.  Lorenzo lives in Venice, Italy, and he is Jewish.  The reader sees the progressive exclusion of Italy's Jews through ever more horrible laws.  Boiling a frog comes to mind, with the local residents adapting to each progressive step, without seeing that it would lead to the Holocaust for Italy's Jews.This is a novel written with a specific purpose in mind, to document the fate of almost every last members of Venice's Jewish community during World War Two.  The author provides an Afterword that explains her intentions, and that she wished to recall the suffering of people at the hands of really evil people, and to honor the good people too.  Another reason was to show the power of music to inspire and to change lives.The novel alternates the narrative between the point of view of Julia in the present, and Lorenzo in the past, using the present tense for the modern day events, and the past tense for the historical events.  Present tense use is very popular these days since it gives an immediacy to a story.  I feel I must give a warning about a scene when a cat is killed in a horrific way, just off scene.As Julia's horrors progress in the present, Lorenzo's horrors progress in the past.  If you dislike horrors, this is not the book for you!  I found the book creepy, sad, very depressing, and the plot a bit too thin.  The plot felt more like a construction made solely for the purpose of writing a Holocaust novel.Personally, I prefer to read non-fiction about that time, since the truth of that era is more twisted and horrible than any fiction writer can ever possibly imagine.  But if you enjoy Holocaust fiction, and Tess Gerritsen's writing style and penchant for horror, then you should enjoy this book.  If you happen to be a musician, too, you will enjoy it even more.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.  I received a review-copy of this book.

"Rick Montoya, the protagonist of the Rick Montoya Italian (Art) Mystery series, is a cowboy boot-wearing, hyphenated Italian from New Mexico in the United States.  His mother was from Rome, Italy, and she made sure her son grew up fluent in her native tongue.  University degrees helped Rick's language skills further, and set him up well for his career as a translator and interpreter in Italy, which is possible because he holds dual citizenship.The recurring cast of the series includes a friend with the Italian art police, and an uncle who is a police Commissario, providing Rick, the amateur detective, with that necessary insider information to help the hero catch the bad guys by the end of the book.These are the books in the series to date:Cold Tuscan StoneDeath in the DolomitesMurder Most UnfortunateI've only read book three in the series, Murder Most Unfortunate, which is set in Northern Italy's Bassano del Grappa on the Brenta River, in the Veneto region.  The murder mystery begins with the murder and we know the motive, making it structured like a police procedural, but we follow an amateur detective, not the police on their search for the killer.Cozy mysteries establish the setting and possible suspects and victims long before the murder takes place, then set the amateur detective loose, but we get those suspects and learn about the victim after the murder in Murder Most Unfortunate.So I'd have to put this book/series as a cross between the two genres, with elements of the traditional male protagonist adventure story, like the hot female character who falls for our tough-smart hero and joins him on his adventure, and some action sequences.  Rick, or Riccardo as he is often called by Italians, has an eye for the ladies, and his handsome looks and cowboy boot, New Mexican uniqueness draws the ladies to him.The author includes descriptions of the Italian setting, but spends a bit more time describing the local food specialties, which should please the vicarious gourmand readers.  There are also some Italian words sprinkled through the story to add flavor.  The dialog is a bit stilted, but that could be because it is used to move the story forward, presenting much of the information through interviews with the suspects.Part of the male adventure story aspect of the story is a hot, green-eyed waif in tight clothes who falls for Rick Montoya and helps him with his investigation.  They get to enjoy some action scenes with racing cars and motorcycles.  The author keeps the story clean, however, and there is only a small bit of in scene violence.All in all it was a light, entertaining read, but probably more suited to the male reader.  Don't expect literature or psychological drama or deep conspiracies.  This is a light mystery novel set in Italy, with a hunky male protagonist, some local color, and much local food.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"While it is tempting to look behind the faÁade of an artist and their work, I think it is always inadvisable.  What one sees is rarely appealing, is what I've learned from experience, and that is very much the case with Frank Sinatra, who was psychologically unwell, despite being artistically exceptional.  The biggest understatement in this book is when the author states that Sinatra had a: ""complex and contradictory soul"".If you are so brave or so foolish to want to see Sinatra more clearly, and you don't want to be too disappointed, then the two doorstops by this author could be the answer:  Frank: The Voice, and Sinatra: The Chairman.  He cleans up the real Sinatra quite a bit, quoting mainly from other people's books, making the portrayed figure someone who might have a wider appeal than the really-real Sinatra, who came to life through the words of the star's valet, George Jacobs.Jacobs wrote My Life with Frank Sinatra, which offered the rough-truth:  vulgar-laden speech, sexual sleaze, alcohol problems, sadistic behavior, criminal behavior, masochistic behavior, racist speech, emotional disturbances, psychological disturbances, and a Jekyll and Hyde character that could veer into violence.  The big sleaze factor of the man's life leaves the reader with a dirty feeling.I had that same dirty feeling while reading this book, Sinatra: The Chairman, since despite the author's attempts to water down the truth with this mild hagiography, the real man shone through.  I wanted to bathe after each reading session.  The early sections feel of the book feel a bit more balanced than the later sections, where the author seems to try to explain and excuse away some of the un-explainable and inexcusable behavior by the star.The crimes alone that the man committed and got away with due to his wealth and celebrity status (perjury, assault and battery, breaking and entering, hiring thugs to quite possibly murder someone, and certainly to beat up people) were enough to make me cringe whenever I hear his name now, especially thinking about the rape that is in the book, that the star paid off with a hundred bucks.Sinatra: The Chairman is divided into five sections that include timeline overlaps, which I found to be confusing at times:The Whirlwind (12 years)The ChairmanMidasFuriesThe Late ShowI would have loved a book that covered only the creative sessions for the beautiful music Sinatra produced, and skipped everything else, since the analyses of the recording sessions, choice of songs, arrangements, and albums, were truly fascinating.  The film studies felt overdone considering the fact that most of Sinatra's films were not so great, in my humble opinion.  I found the life studies depressing for their portrayal of a man I would never want to even be in the same room with.The harshest notes in the book are reserved for Sinatra's last wife, Barbara Marx.  What the author did not point out, however, was that when you spend your psychologically disturbed life using woman and discarding them, the only kind of woman you're likely to end up with is one who is with you for financial security.Actually, from how the author describes Sinatra, it makes sense that he married a gold-digger, since he would have only trusted a relationship in which he held all the power firmly in his hands, or more specifically, in his bank accounts.If you can stand the sleaze, there are lots of anecdotes in Sinatra: The Chairman about the man's fits of rage, relationships, ambitions, traumas, crimes, and so on.  With the pseudo-psychological analysis that the book offers for a man who clearly needed a real psychological analysis and treatment, the author stresses repeatedly that: ""Constant activity was a balm to Sinatra's ferocious impatience, his tenor of boredom and solitude.""Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"This legal-romance stars an interesting Italian-American protagonist, Benedetta (Bennie) Rosato.  Bennie is a lawyer in Philadelphia.  She is also six foot tall, in her 40s, with a blond curly mop of hair, blue eyes, and a non-girly-girl character.""She was fully six feet tall, which came in handy in a courtroom, if less on a date.""Bennie remains the focus of the book, and we learn much about her past, her present, her desires, her interests, and what she thinks of herself, with her self-deprecating humor taking a fore.""Bennie wished she were better in the maternal department, but she didn't get a lot of practice, unless you counted golden retrievers.""The first paragraph of Corrupted sets a hard-boiled tone, with the only exception to that genre being it is not a first-person narrative.""Bennie Rosato hadn't taken a murder case in years, but she'd have to take this one.  She'd been working late when the call came in, from a time she didn't want to remember and a place she didn't want to revisit.  Still, she'd said yes.  She couldn't assign the case to an associate, either.  Nobody paid her debts but her.  And she wanted redemption.""The hard-boiled style does not persist however.  The third-person limited narration does, from Bennie's perspective, and we remain firmly there.  There is lots of local Philly color and excellent quality writing, if you ignore the sentence fragments created by popular punctuation misuse, in this well-plotted novel.I thought the main characters were presented well, believably, and they felt realistic.  We meet them almost always exclusively through dialog, with very little description of setting and action, almost in third-person objective (dramatic) style.  I did think that the love interest was a bit too perfect physically, reminding me of a Harlequin novel.Corrupted expertly starts with the set-up, the premise for the book, and introduces the protagonist.  Then Part One begins, going back to 2002, to present the backstory.  Part of that backstory is a love affair for Bennie.  The original case takes up the first half of the book.Part Two brings the reader back to the present, which includes an investigation of the present case, and a confrontation for Bennie with her former love.Part Three is the trial, and that will please fans of courtroom dramas, especially when the case is resolved in real Perry Mason style through an unusual cross-examination.The denouement sets the stage for more interesting personal stories for Benedetta (Bennie) Rosato in books to come.A warning:  the bulk of the story is gritty, rough and sad.  The reader learns much about juvenile justice system in Corrupted, and it is indeed corrupt.  The very depressing aspects of child law and the damage it can do to child development are central to what the author set out to write, as she explains in her Afterword to Corrupted.She wanted to write, as she always does in her books:  ""...about the intersection of justice and law""But this book looked for inspiration to a real-life tragedy that grew out of greed and a lack of working consciences, that the author wanted to highlight so it would never happen again.  She set out to write a:  ""moving and instructive novel""Corrupted is moving and instructive, and very much based in Philly law, the setting for the story and the real-life crimes.The lighter moments in the book are often with the staff at the law firm, who are described briefly for those who have not read the other books in the series.  For example, here is the description of Bennie's legal partner:  ""Mary DiNunzio was proverbially short and sweet, a South-Philly Italian-American, with a tendency toward co-dependency.""Bennie's dry observations of life around her, and life in general, add humor too.  ""...she couldn't remember the last time she'd been picked up in a bar with antlers.""  ""Life was an individual sport.""The protagonist's Italian-American heritage does not shine through, which could be because her upbringing was anything but typical of Italian-Americans, as we learn during the course of the book.Corrupted is book 3 in the Rosato & DiNunzio series, which is a spin-off series from the author's 11 book Rosato & Associates series.  The two law firms provide the main cast of the stories, with each book featuring one female lawyer as the protagonist.A legal case sets off the story that then follows the trail through court sessions, brainstorming sessions, investigations, confrontations which are sometimes thrilling and sometimes not, family or personal angst, and the courtroom ending.I believe that the publisher does a disservice to this writer by promoting her books as something they are not and with unnecessary hyperbole, leaving quite a few readers disappointed when the book doesn't meet the expectations the marketers' created with their promotional texts.What the author is not, is a Grisham or Turow clone.  Those two legal thriller writers' books are firmly male-perspective, even when they have supposedly female protagonists.If you purchase Lisa Scottoline's books with a clear head, knowing that you are getting legal romance/family novels, with some suspense, written from a female perspective for female readers, then you have a good chance of enjoying the books.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"The subtitle of this book is A History of Philosophy without any gaps, Volume 2.  It is the book form of a podcast available on-line.  In the book you will learn about:- Hellenistic Philosophy,- Pagan Philosophy in the Roman Empire, and- (Judeo) Christian Philosophy in the Roman Empire.The book is divided into those three parts, but has many overlaps.  Included for eager students are Notes, a Bibliography, an Index (in the print edition) and a Further Reading list.In this volume one meets the Skeptics, Epicurus, Stoics... all sorts of curious characters, including Plotinus, Augustine and Philo of Alexandria, and even Moses of Old Testament (Torah) fame.  The author tries to engage the reader, often using popular culture references or questions:""Do you like a nice garden?  Do you enjoy the company of friends?  Do you believe the world is made of tiny particles, which you call atoms?  Do you trust the evidence of your senses?  Do you find politics tiresome, and raise a skeptical eyebrow at those who live in fear of God?  If your answer to these questions is ""yes"", then you might want to consider becoming an Epicurean.""The religious philosophers were concerned with what all philosophers are concerned with:  ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, philology, the mind, and even political philosophy such as how society should best be governed.A direct line is drawn from Moses to Plato to Aristotle to the Stoics to Neo-Platonism to Judeo-Christian thought.  All those thinkers stress the need to turn away from the pleasure of the body (our animalistic nature) and turn toward virtue and a faithfulness to God (our divine nature).  One must be aware of both our higher and lower natures, and integrate the two as a whole person, self plus soul.The author has more books in the works, and plans to cover in his works all 2500 years of western philosophical thought, without any gaps.Pre-SocraticsPlato and AristotleHellenistic period philosophersRoman era thinkersJudeo-Christian thinkersAncient philosophies preserved by Muslims, then Christian monks, leading toByzantine and Renaissance thought and philosophyThe EnlightenmentModern and Post-Modern thought and philosophyThe author aims to educate anyone who wants to know about the history of philosophy, through his podcasts, and with the books.  His style is approachable and knowledgeable.  He lightens the text with humor when possible.So if you are interested in learning the history of thoughts on how we should live, and what is the nature of man, truth, language and knowledge, this might be a book for you, together with Book 1 which covers Classical Philosophy, namely Plato and Aristotle.I've read other philosophy books, and attended university lectures on philosophy, so I have some basis of comparison when judging this book.  To me, it reads like a really fun philosophy professor's lecture notes.The professor is modern minded, including two subjects professors of history and philosophy often skip when talking about the ancients:  pervasive slavery and the negligible role of women in the paternalistic societies.  I would have like to have seen more mention of the institutional sadism of the societies in which these philosophers lived, another subject often overlooked.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"I'm a Mina fan, I'll admit that up front. Her adventures are always unpredictable, with some romance in the mix. This time around we get to see what Diego, the love of her life, is really thinking, and what was going on in his mind in the previous book, when he ran into Mina after not having seen her for a long while. It is very sweet how he understands her and keeps her fears and insecurities in check. They make a great pair. And through the adventures in this book, you can feel their strong attachment, and get the feeling that it will last for a long time to come. I thank the author for the review-copy of the book.

"The subtitle of this book is The Definitive Walking Guide to the Eternal City.  The 15 walking tours are varied through era and location, and include:-a small map and a things of interest,-as well as the opening hours of the monuments and museums,-bus and public transport information,-ticket purchasing and lining up info, and-other bits of practical information.The book has tours for the day tripper, with a Rome in a Day Tour. There is the obligatory Vatican Tour. Then the Tombs and Catacomb Tour. Ostia gets a tour of its own. The eras have tours:  Renaissance, Byzantine, Ancient Rome. And special locations have tours:  Capitoline Hill, certain Piazzas, Vias and hills.I've always struggled to get a grip on Rome because the city is so big.  Public transport can bring you around to the starting points for your tours, but the crush of humanity, smells, sights and traffic always leaves me exhausted, too exhausted to enjoy what I‚Äôm seeing.  Traveling in off-peak seasons can help.The historical significance of what you will see in Rome is pretty much left for you the reader to discover someplace else, and over time, since Rome's history is about 3000 years old.  The author is an experience tour guide, and he knows his history, so the tours are complete and comprehensive.A dream would be to have all the time to prepare for the 15 tours, and then all the time and stamina to do all 15 tours.  It just might make the bucket list of a few people.  I imagine the book would make a good accompaniment for repeated visits to the Eternal City, doing a few tours each time.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"I was lucky to receive an advanced reader copy of this book, since I review books about Italy and Italian-Americans. One of the sleuths, and the policeman, in this cute series are Italian-American, one with a penchant for Italian desserts that make your mouth water. I think I enjoy the setting most in this series, and especially in this book in the series. It offers plenty of picturesque scenes for murder and sleuths and friends. Lots of mature characters, and they are all so busy, it is inspiring!

"A book all about gelato, ice cream and sorbets, what could be bad about that?  Well, nothing.  This book is great.  I especially enjoyed the brief history of Italian ices.  The recipes are clear and simple to follow, too, and the images are lovely.The book includes:Gelato (25 recipes)Iced Drinks (Frullato-Frappe and Granita - 14 recipes)Sorbets (21 recipes)Iced Desserts (like semifreddo and spumone -16 recipes)Cake and Cookies (10 recipes)The author makes it seem so simple, and she even gives instructions for making the recipes with and without using an ice cream making machine.  A extra bonus are some recipes for cakes and cookies that go well with gelato.  In the print book, which is about 75 pages long, there's an index for easy reference.Italy has a long history of ice treats, going back to Ancient Roman times, including snowcones and iced wine, and ices like today's sorbets and granita desserts.  Today's standards are all here, along with newer flavors like a Limoncello gelato, and granita with almost and cardamom, and a sorbet made with Vernaccia di San Gimignano wine.I've made some of the Frullato recipes and loved them.  I suspect this is the sort of book that would make a great Italophile gift this summer!Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"I've been reading the Lella York series since the beginning, so I was very happy to receive an advance copy in exchange for an honest review. Lella is a real woman with real women foibles, and she's an Italian whose lived in America for a long time, but who still sees every day as a new adventure in a new land. The book is like the others, in that we follow Lella through a short period in her daily life. Being Lella, she gets into interesting situations, to say the least! Her love interest is great, and a great match for Lella, so their interactions are my favorite part of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HM07XRA74FEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106PA4CM#wasThisHelpful","R1HM07XRA74FEY","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book I've read by this author, and I loved this one too.  The first book was Letters from Home about her time in Europe with her serviceman husband in the 70s.  You could call this book the prequel since it covers her early life up to her departure for Europe, but it is so much more than that.The engaging style, which feels like a storyteller of old sitting by the fire each evening telling you about the ""olden days"", pulls you in and keeps you interested all the way through.  Never too much.  Never too little.  Just enough about each subject.  And always told with respect, love, heart and decency.While these may be the life stories of the author and her loved ones, they are also the social history of her community and of America.  Presented in a direct, engaging style, the reader hears about the details of daily life from the 1920s through the 1970s, some of it inspiring, some heartbreaking.  The only subject skirted was race.I hope that the publishing revolution will produce many more of these life stories, since they are so much more relevant than some sociologist's generalities.  If tweens and teens had to read books like this one alongside their social-studies books and history books, I'm sure they would learn a heck of a lot more about American social history and about their fellow human beings.I bought this book at another retailer but I really wanted to share my impressions of it here, too, so other readers could get a good idea about the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2946V5LWLP9UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCC1JG2#wasThisHelpful","R2946V5LWLP9UQ","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The subtitle of this book is An Inspirational Italian Historical Fiction Novel, and it is that, as well as being a clean fiction coming-of-age novel suitable for tweens, teens and adults.  It is also a celebration of Italian opera.The story pauses at times to provide the reader with small histories of operas that appear in the book.  Even some of the librettos are reproduced for the reader.  And a choral work plays an important part in the story, just as it did in Italy's history.The story begins in Sicily in 1897 and follows a young man along his life's path that is filled with love for his village, his father, and for opera.Like all good coming-of-age novels, the protagonist, Giuseppe, discovers love and life and makes a momentous decision that changes his life forever, but in this novel Giuseppe does it all to a subtle accompaniment of operatic music.The author brings to life a time when opera was part of every Italian's daily life.  As the author says:  ""Musica, and especially opera, can touch a person's soul in a way that nothing else can.  ...  It can bind the listening audience together.""The author paints a picture of the era before motorcars, when agriculture provided the most employment.  One gets the feeling of the slower pace of life.  Journeys take longer.  Distances feel greater.Giuseppe's father, Antonio, treats his son to many trips, having the boy join him on business trips all over Italy, to places like Milan, Florence, Rome, Palermo.Through his journeys Giuseppe gets an education that is greater than the other villagers.  He sees a bigger world where things change or are better than where he lives.  This inspires him to try to help his fellow villagers.The author has a stylized voice, giving the book a fairytale feeling.  He uses very formal dialog, perhaps trying to better convey the era to the reader.  There are Italian words in the text to remind the reader that everything they are reading is actually happening in Italy and in Italian.There is a strong moral message in the book.  ""Never be afraid to stand up to the powerful.  The alternative is fear and degradation.""The only thing I missed was an Afterword to explain what in the novel was history and what was invention.  Some of this was explained in the book itself, but a little more at the end would have been lovely.This is a gentle coming-of-age story with a happy ending.  A young boy grows up to be an inspiration to his friends and family, and even his enemies.  He discovers love and a purpose for his life.  This is a clean novel suitable for tweens, teens and adults.  If you enjoy Italian opera, or are curious about it, this book will have a special appeal for you.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"Beautiful Capri, Italy, and southern Italy's volcanoes are the settings for many of the events in Summer of Fire, an International Romantic Thriller.  The reader gets to jet-set along with the characters through Italy, with stops in England, Norway, Iceland and France.  Good guys, bad guys, lovers, adventurers all come together for an exciting finish.It all begins in Capri, which the author describes thus:""There was a magical timelessness to Capri  A special atmosphere, and a sense of history. ...  Nowhere on earth was more romantic.""And Capri turns out to be a retreat for many of the book's characters, a place to escape the world, a romantic retreat.We get lots of threads as the book builds its plot:  a forbidden love affair, a death that is possibly a gangster hit, a policeman determined to keep Capri mobster-free, a Camorra boss and his killer/burglar, teen boys seeking adventure, priceless jewels, and a loving couple who might make a deeper commitment if given a moment's peace.The author weaves all the stories together creating dangerous situations galore.  There is some in-scene violence, and a handful of vulgarities.  The writing is smooth (I always like more past-perfects than many writers use), and the story flows well.  The voice is third-person limited, allowing us into the heads of various characters over the course of the book, but only one per section.This is a European crime story with lots of romance and some thrills and chills.  I liked that the author had our heroes feel horrible when they had to take a life to save themselves or others, showing the difference between them and the sociopathic bad guys.""I know there was no real choice.  But it's still hard to kill a man.""The author adds into the mix information on the active volcanoes in Europe, even putting us over one as it erupts, and on another as the lava starts to flow.  This International Romantic Thriller is a fun read for a holiday, or when you just want to feel like you're on holiday, perhaps just to enjoy the fantasy of being in the Capri villa along with the book's characters.

"The book is a richly imagined autobiography of Nathanial Hawthorne's wife, Sophia Peabody, purportedly writing about her life with Nathanial.  The book is rich with scholarship, strong creative writing skills (highly poetic style with a lovely turn or phrase), and imaginative power.It is the book people in her day wished Sophia had written, but which would have shocked the life out of them.  Sophia's natural reserve, and her respect for her husband's reserve, stopped her from printing anything so personal as this book.In our day and age, and in our tell-all-society, however, we are more comfortable with the intimate details this author includes.  There are sex scenes, and the book is definitely for adults, but the old-fashioned language used makes the scenes seem quaint, not vulgar, and they are not explicit.The present tense used makes the past feel closer to the present-day reader.  The First-person narration brings the reader into the mind of Sophia, a complex, sensitive, loving, intelligent, intuitive, passionate, introverted woman.The writer uses a common trope by starting with the ending, Nathanial's death, then switching to a roughly chronological storyline, ending the book with Nathanial's death.  I think the book could have done without this, and I wish the author had ended the book on Sophia's natural ending, her death.  We are immersed in so much of her life, it feels like the last part of the book is missing.The writer reflects the tone of language of the era, and the Romantics' obsession with death and illness, as well as nature.  This was an era of common serious and deadly illnesses, and with poisons in the home and surroundings causing much suffering, so necessarily there is much death and suffering portrayed in the book (be forewarned!).If you are like me, you will pause your reading often in order to read up on the many people mentioned in the book:  the Emersons, Margaret Fuller, the Browings, the Peabodies, Thoreau, the Alcotts...  But even if you don't want to read up on these people, I would suggest you read the book is pieces.  If you don't pause now and then, the book can feel like a life passing before your eyes, a life of tremendous and at times overwhelming detail.At a certain point Sophia's worshipping of her husband became tiresome to me, just as it would from any person you might meet today, since the reality of any human being is never all pure, but always tainted with some darkness.  The Sophia in this book seems oblivious to the dark in her husband, just as the real Sophia who printed a collection of their letters and journals after Nathanial's death seemed oblivious.In the end, I have to say that the book is quite an accomplishment of creative writing enriched by scholarship!  I enjoyed it!

"The protagonist of the cozy mystery series Ghostwriter Mysteries is Roxy.  She authors books for other people, leaving her name off the cover, and leaving the fame to the name author, in exchange for a comfortable living.  Unfortunately adventure and mystery stalks mild-mannered wordsmith Roxy Parker, who is:""...the first to suspect foulplay in any situation.""Luckily Roxy is also an investigative journalist, so she is well-equipped to track down the truths and to resolve the mysteries.  Most of her stories occur in her native Australia, peppering the books in the series with wonderfully entertaining Aussie-isms (for non-Australians), dry humor, and stunning scenery.  However, book 5 in the series takes Roxy to the Italian Riviera for some equally stunning scenery.The author explains the change in scenery for Roxy (in a mail to me when I received a review-copy):My husband and I took our boys to Europe in 2013 and the Cinque Terre was one of our most cherished destinations.  We stayed in the heart of Riomaggiore for four days and loved every minute of it. While there I decided I just had to bring my protagonist Roxy Parker back.  It's such a magical place and I knew it would lend itself to a vibrant and colourful mystery.Roxy's mystery is not just vibrant and colorful, it is mysterious and life-threatening for someone very close to her.  TIP:  Avoid the book's description if you want enjoy Words Can Kill to its fullest.  Paired with Caroline, a compatriot who is the complete opposite of Roxy, there are laughs and conflicts that lead both women to grow and groan along the way to resolving the mystery.Along with the cozy fun, we get an accurate depiction of a ghostwriter's precarious career.  Part of the entertainment of this cozy series is that Roxy gets to change her scenery and associates quite often, at least with every new writing contract.  That keeps the stories fresh, and saves the population of her hometown from massacre, unlike the unlucky inhabitants of Jessica Fletcher's Cabot Cove (reference: TV's Murder She Wrote).The books in the Ghostwriter Mystery Series to date are:Killer TwistA Plot to Die ForLast WritesDying WordsWords Can KillThe books are well-written, well-edited, and presented stylishly with eye-catching covers.  The cozy elements are all there, including a possible love interest for Roxy, whose mother has decided:""You're destined for spinsterhood...""Each book can be read as a standalone book, but to understand the recurring characters' relationships it would be best to read the books in order.Be ready for some real pain and danger for Roxy's loved ones in Words Can Kill, in which the amateur sleuth's emotions are put through a wringer.  But trust that Roxy's dogged determination wins out in the end.The Italian scenery and characters enrich the book for any Italophile; two thirds of the book takes place in Italy.  We get good and bad guy Italians, an exciting finish, and a meaty Epilog in which all the loose ends are wrapped up for the reader.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTPA470IEZLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0992474302#wasThisHelpful","R2DTPA470IEZLE","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victor Barnier is a super-spy in the James Bond tradition, but with a difference:  he is Anglo-Italian, and he works not for a government agency but for a private security firm.  Hotel Caruso, the bad guys' stronghold that is just outside of Taormina-Sicily, is the name of Book One in the growing Victor Barnier Series.Victor works for SORN and he is known as:""...one of the Seniors, a group of ten agents tasked with the most top-secret and dangerous missions.""All the elements of a Bond espionage book are present.  We have the baddies, the secretive good guys, the expert assassinations, the evil mastermind, and the protagonist who is subjected to horrible suffering before finally winning out in the end.  There is some disturbing violence in the book, pretty much on par with the James Bond novels.The writing style reminded me of John LeCarre's espionage book style, with a subtle shifting between an omniscient narrator and a 3rd-person limited narration.  The prose is smooth and expert, with a few lingering typos that will certainly be weeded out soon.Victor Barnier gets a great intro at the beginning of the book, and he grows in depth as the book progresses.  He is a damaged man, or he wouldn't be a professional killer, and he has a very surprising manifestation of his damaged nature, that I won't reveal, but which is sure to surprise readers.  We get explanations of some of the causes of his damaged nature, and there are hints of more causes that are left for development in future books.Like all espionage books, Hotel Caruso begins with the our spy, then his mission, then the bad guys, scuffles, bigger scuffles, near defeat, then a resurgence of our hero, who wins in the end but at a cost to his sanity and health.  He lives to fight another bad guy, another day, but life does not get any easier for our hero.  All is accompanied by some cool techno-gadgets!Much of the action in the book takes place in Sicily, just outside of beautiful Taormina in the shadow of Mount Etna.  The bad guys' stronghold is actually a resort hotel overlooking the bay of Taormina.  Illegal arms traders along the Mediterranean Sea set off the story, but with nice surprises and twists the story quickly builds into a mission to save the capitals of many nations.  Hotel Caruso is for spy-novel fans!Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Z9C48CU00QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T817B86#wasThisHelpful","R29Z9C48CU00QZ","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Davide is a novel of spiritual fantasy that follows a man along his picaresque journey from troubled intellectual, to lightning struck man, to a man imbued with the graces of St. Francis, to the life he builds using those graces.  It is a gentle book filled with a message of kindness and charity.David, the ornery, wealthy Italian-American protagonist, a famous history professor at Harvard University in the States, is visiting Assisi in Italy when his transformation takes place.  That is appropriate, since St. Francis set up his religious community in Assisi, and it has been a pilgrimage destination for the faithful for centuries.""The cluster of medieval building surrounded by a wall and spilling down the slope below...""Through the course of the book, we learn about the man David was before he was altered by the lightning strike combined with some divine intervention.  Through the 3rd-person limited narration, we enter David's mind and see how he deals with the drastic changes in his perspective, goals, emotions, and values.St. Francis was a kind, gentle man, a follower not a leader, keen on reconciliation, forgiveness, compassion, justice, and he was a lover of nature and all God's creatures.  David finds himself imbued with these characteristics, and provided with an elderly woman (a guardian angel) who helps smooth his way along to his new life.""What happened in Italy turned his world inside out.  When he met Nola [his spiritual guide], things became as loony as Alice's Wonderland.""The story of Davide is the journey David makes to a new life.  Most of the story takes place in Italy, in and around Assisi, which is described lovingly by the author.  There is a brief part of the story that takes place in Boston and New York City in the States, when David returns to visit family and to deal with some former business.But the central story in Davide is David's relationship with Nola, his spiritual guide.  Their relationship varies throughout the book, sometimes bantering, at times chiding, sometimes loving in a mother-son way.  Their dynamic provides much of the drive for the story, and it is enriched with the author's beautiful descriptions of Nola's mystical nature.Nola encourages David to try to spread goodwill and kindness rather than anger, controversy and fear.  This is the message of the book, and it is demonstrated by how David changes his live after receiving his gifts.  Providing comfort and understanding turns out to be much more productive and helpful to the world than the path of criticizing and grandstanding that David had taken pre-transformation.I think this book will appeal to those who enjoy reading about people on a spiritual journey.

"Italian-American Carla Ferrari, a former police officer, the daughter of a police officer, is a private investigator in Boston, in the U.S, in Edited Out, Book Two in the Murder in Boston Series.  She has the P.I.'s requisite quirky, mouthy receptionist.  She also has a close-knit Italian-American family, and a hunky on-again-off-again boyfriend.  There is a growing genre of book that has all these elements, providing an ethnically flavored crime-romance-comedy for fans.The humor in Edited Out comes mostly from the characters of Carla's mother and Carla's sassy, stupid yet loyal receptionist.  Lots of Italian words and culture and food fly about those two characters, and among the families and the Italian community.  Some people might consider the characters stereotypical, others might find them realistic, but they are flat characters, mainly there to provide some lightness to the story.There is a grittiness to the story, too, with death, widows, cops, and dark Boston settings, not to mention the main character's grief about her breakup with Nick Calvi, a homicide detective.At its best moments, the writing is reminiscent of Elmore Leonard or Robert B. Parker or Raymond Chandler.  Imagine a depressive Humphrey Bogart, with his wiseacre receptionist, and the crying female client who walks into the office.  Set them all in Boston, and lace the dialog with Boston slang.  But don't forget that Humphrey is a woman in this P.I. series.The writing is not always consistent, however, seemingly a blend of the Noir P.I. style and the cozy murder mystery style with the narration in 3rd person limited.  The details of the criminal case become swamped by the cozy fun, and Carla's work is not always as sharp as one would expect from a former policewoman.But if you enjoy an Italian-flavored cozy mystery with a kick-ass female protagonist, then you might enjoy Edited Out and the Murder in Boston Series.

"The subtitle of this memoirs/self-help book is The Life-Changing Wisdom of History's Greatest Poem (Dante's Divine Comedy).  The author offers an engaging read about his midlife crisis and how Dante's masterpiece helped him through it, along with help from his pastor, his therapist, his down-to-earth wife, and his supportive and accepting friends.The book is presented as an inspirational text for those who might be tempted to make their own Dante pilgrimage, a journey of self-discovery and self-realization, by way of atonement and renewed motivation to lead a decent life.  To be honest, I felt it could just as effectively have been written as a straight memoirs, and the self-help aspect left for readers to discover on their own if they felt the need.In the author's words:""This medieval masterpiece, perhaps the greatest poem ever written, reached me when I thought I was unreachable, and lit the way out of a dark wood of depression, confusion, and a stress-related auto-immune disease that, had it persisted, would have dangerously degraded my health.""The memoirs is in four parts:1.Part I - From the Garden to the Dark Wood2.Part II - Inferno, or Why you are Broken3.Part III - Purgatorio, or How to be Healed4.Part IV - Paradiso, or The Way Things Ought to BeIt is said that all of life is in the Commedia divina, as the Divine Comedy is known in its original Italian.  The epic poem can be read on many levels:  as a fantastical adventure, as a religious tract, as a philosophical treatise, or as the author uses it as a guide to how to live a moral life.  Some have even conjectured that one reason Dante wrote it was to take revenge on his enemies.What is the poem about?  In the author's words:""Dante's tale is a fantasy about a lost man who finds his way back to life after walking through the pits of hell, climbing up the mountain of purgatory, and ascending to the heights of Heaven.  But it's really a story about real life and the incredible journey of our lives, yours and mine.""The family travails that trigger the author's crisis are not unique, especially if you have watched the TV sitcom Fraser which dealt with the father-son and the sibling dynamics, but that does not lessen the author's suffering, nor should it lessen our compassion for his suffering, and for his family's suffering.From his descriptions in the book, one can deduce that he is an erudite intellectual, curious about the world and the world of ideas, and he is fact and reality addicted.  His immediate family are tradition-based, change-averse, narrow-minded fantasists; like many insecure and fearful people, they prefer the world they imagine to exist, to the world that really does exists.Given those differences, conflict was inevitable.If a person like the author is placed, either by birth or by choice, among people like his described family, he will most certainly be harassed and ostracized until he either kills himself, gets killed, or leaves to maintain his sanity and health.  That is the way it has always been and it is probably the way it will always be.Inexplicably, the author chooses to return to that environment, and to remain in it even when his sanity and health falters.  He puts the well-being of his wife and children at risk in a stubborn (and selfish?) attempt to understand why the poor treatment he receives leaves him disoriented and disappointed.As a writer, the author had often advocated a return to small, religion and tradition-based communities.  I suspect much of his disorientation and disappointment was at the poor reception he received when he took his own advice and moved back to just such a community.  He had certainly romanticized the community of his youth, because the reality of it seemed to shock him to the core.The author's journey back to physical and mental health came from meditation through prayer, guided self-analysis, and through his own intelligence by using Dante's Divine Comedy as bibliotherapy, which produced joy in him through the intellectual stimulation it provided.I have my doubts about the author's ability to stay healthy in the narrow-minded community in which he has chosen to live.  His emotional, sensitive, over-intellectualizing, mystical, highly moral, and at times monomaniacal character is not well-suited to the severe, defensive, rural society he calls home.  And I suspect that the publication of this book will not improve his place in the eyes of his extended family and small community.What carried me through this challenging book was the fluid, engaging writing that linked together extracts from Dante's poem with biographical sections, and with discourses on philosophy and theology.  The author has a talent for explaining thoughts, feelings, conundrums, faith, loss, conflicts and characters concisely, with a seemingly effortless prose style that is a joy to read.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"Cooking Spirits is the latest, or perhaps the last, book in the Angie Amalfi Mystery Series; it is not clear which. Because the story seemed to be making a happy end of many long running threads in the series, such as Angie's search for a career and for married love, I assumed it was a late addition to the series, six years after the previous book, to give the fans an ending for their beloved character. But then the closure didn't arrive.Spoiled, Italian-American Angie Amalfi has 14 books in which she tries and fails in a career, struggles to find a secure mate but seems to fail, gets involved in a mystery and with much help solves it. For fans of cozy mysteries featuring an Italian-American amateur detective, that's a lot of books of fun, relaxing reading to look forward to!Angie lives very comfortably in San Francisco, supported by her wealthy property tycoon father. For most of the books, Angie's love interest is San Francisco Homicide Detective Paavo, and yes, that is his first name. True to a seemingly universal cozy rule, both Angie and Paavo are drop-dead-gorgeous. Angie is also a clothes horse.Cooking Spirits is actually two books wrapped around each other: Paavo's police procedural case of double homicide, and Angie's house-hunting and wedding problems. Angie's part of the story involves a paranormal storyline.There is a strong sense of place in the book, with lots of mentioning of streets, buildings, districts and places. Many of the characters from the previous books are included in the story. There are three recipes at the end of the book. And we are treated to the menu of all of Angie's main meals.This is a leisurely paced book, probably of most interest to Angie and Paavo fans. There is an exciting finish, but not a lot of resolution at the end of the book for Angie and Paavo. It feels like the author may be planning on continuing the series for a few books more.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2540EYFHIN6MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH9S3Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2540EYFHIN6MU","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The subtitle of this book explains what it is:  Cooking and Reminiscing with the Italian Grandmothers of Enoteca Maria.  Don't know this New York restaurant?""Enoteca Maria takes great home cooking seriously. At this intimate, hospitable restaurant on Staten Island, all the cooking is done by ten nonnas (grandmothers), drawing on their own family recipes, handed down for generations, which reflect their regional traditions.""There are apartments and houses to rent in Italy that include the services of an Italian grandmother to cook your meals.  The restaurateur was seemingly not inspired by that to create his restaurant.  He explains in the book how it came about.  He was:""...looking for authenticity, to preserve vanishing traditions.""The Italian grandmothers come from diverse Italian regions, and their local specialties are respected, as can be seen in the mix of recipes in this cookbook/memoirs.  The restaurant aims to feel the primal connection between food and family, so the recipes are original family fare.I have to say that I found the memoirs parts of the book more interesting than the recipes, which are wonderful.  But there are hundreds (thousands?!) of Italian cookbooks in print, each with sections mirroring this cookbook's from appetizers to desserts.  However, life stories of Italian grandmothers are a rarer read.  That is what we get in most of the memoirs sections about the grandmothers who cook at Enoteca Maria (named for the restaurateur's grandmother), life stories of real personalities, real people.Most fascinating to me is how moving to America freed these women from stifling Italian convention.  They all express joy in being able to follow their culinary instincts to experiment with timeworn recipes.  They take advantage of time-saving kitchen equipment.  They improvise with seasonal ingredients.  They cook for pleasure, as a creative outlet.On top of all that, they recognize the liberation they enjoy in America, the freedom to earn a living, to divorce, to bring up their children as they see fit, to socialize and to embrace the excitement of living near New York City.  And all of the grandmothers, most of whom have had very difficult childhoods, embrace the convenience of American living, and the social freedom.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.

"The latest books in this long police procedural/mystery series set in Venice, Italy, have read less like novels and more like novelizations of TV episodes.  Falling in Love is no exception.  The construction of the book is like an episode:  we meet the victim and see an incident, later the policeman is called in and he investigates, an action elevates the threat, and that threat continues until the exciting climax comes and the policeman leads the shaken woman home.What we don't get is Brunetti acting in any way to save the day or the victim.  I think the story could have existed, with very little change, without Brunetti being involved at all, which is quite odd.  If you are a diehard Brunetti fan, you will get your scenes with his family, his co-workers, his boss, his parents-in-law, and scenes of Brunetti wandering the beautiful streets and bridges of Venice.  We even have the requisite comment:""We live in Paradise, don't we?""However, we spend much of the book in the mind and life of the opera singer, Flavia.  We learn much about the life of an opera diva in Falling in Love, which I received as a review-copy.  The catch phrases ""Too much information"" and ""More than I wanted to know"" popped into my mind while reading this book.  But if you are an avid opera fan, you may find those parts of the book interesting.Flavia was an abrasive character introduced in the first book in the series, and who made a return in a later book.  Her back story is more hinted at than mined in this story, making some of the references by the character confusing if you have not read the previous two books.Quickly, she is a bisexual woman with an ex-husband and children, who had to give up her lesbian lover in order to not lose custody of her children during her divorce.  Her references to her past lesbian relationships are odd, to say the least, dismissing them as something akin to a hobby, ""having given that up"".Most of the narration in the book is in third-person limited, but there is some omniscient narration, too.  The point-of-view is quite often Flavia's, but more often Guido Brunetti's.  Through Flavia's eyes, in the beginning of the book, we see Guido's trademark affection for his wife, his sense of humor and his self-deprecating attitude.  When we switch to Brunetti's point of view, we get to see how extremely observant he is, and how quickly he can read people.The British single quotes in place of double quotes may annoy some readers.  And the abrupt ending will disappoint fans, just as it did in the previous book in the series; the readers never gets to learn how the culprit managed the crimes.Please visit my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDF6372M3003/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123538#wasThisHelpful","R3UDF6372M3003","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chef Maurice is a fun character to base a series on.  He's eccentric, much like Agatha Christie's Poirot, a man out of his element, with his own culture and eccentric habits.He is strong-minded, and not bound by the rules of convention.  The Chef loves his life as a chef but he also embraces the excitement of a mystery to solve.""He had truffles to find, a new four-legged friend to train, and now a murder to solve.  Cooking was all very well, but he felt he could do with a little more mental stimulation at this point in his life.""Careful to follow cozy/cosy conventions, there is no vulgarity, no violence in-scene, there is light humor, and there is even some romance for minor characters.  We get the traditional gathering of the suspects at the end, when the Chef reveals the killer and the motive.There is a strong supporting cast, including the truffle-hunting miniature pig, and the Chef's best friend and neighbor, who is the amateur detective's confident.Well-edited, and well-written with excellent use of the omniscient narrator, the book is entertaining and laced with sweet humor, especially when portraying the point of view of the animals. I received a review-copy.The Chef Maurice series is one that will appeal to fans of Christie's Poirot, and of English cosy mystery TV shows like Midsomer Murder, and Rosemary and Thyme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKOB3M70VUEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOO2QW8#wasThisHelpful","ROKOB3M70VUEV","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sold cozy mystery, well-written, with lots of fun elements, and a beautiful small town setting that rings true.The most unique part of the book, and the series, is the setting in an amateur theatre group, a community theatre.  All those parts rings true, too, and had me recalling with pleasure the Canadian TV series ""Slings and Arrows"".  If they had had to deal with a murder, it might have been something like this book!  Lots of humor, drama, mayhem and heart.The series books will vary between romances and mysteries, giving the reader an interesting variation.  The author is Australian but sets the story in Maine in the States, so American readers may notice a few Aussie-isms, but I suggest you just turn a blind eye to them, or enjoy them for fun.  The story is solid and the writing is very entertaining, sticking to genre.  I received a review-copy.The protagonist grows slowly for the reader, from a solitary wallflower who bursts out with energy that surprises even her.  She grows through the course of the book, and learns much about herself.  This is very refreshing in a cozy, many of which too often take the Jessica Fletcher route and have the protagonist stay exactly the same from book to book.There is a strong supporting cast of unique characters each with their own stories.  Being a book about theatre and actors and musical theatre actors, it is not surprising there are gay characters in the book.  They are portrayed in many variations, all reflecting bits of reality, and none portrayed with malice, for which I commend the author.Besides the inside look at a small theatre group, which will surly be a lot of fun for anyone who has had anything to do with theatre groups, we are also let into the mind of an artist, a painter, the protagonist.  We get to see the world through her eyes, which is very different from how non-painters see the world.  The author even treats us to some lovely meditations on art and life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETAGWP2KXB7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3PCPW2#wasThisHelpful","R3ETAGWP2KXB7R","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ellery Adams always delivers a quality cozy murder mystery. She keeps it light but interesting, with all the requisite elements. The amateur detective, the love interest, the sounding boards, the various suspects.This series, of which this is the first book (review-copy received), has a very southern U.S. feel to it, being set in North Carolina. The reader learns much about the local artisan pottery traditions, and meets many of the local characters involved in it.The protagonist is a big gal not lacking in confidence. She is forging a career and pursuing a man, with help along the way from friends and her mother.I thought the gay character was a bit too stereotypical, but it is something that an openly gay character is even in the cozy novel! Well done, Ellery Adams!I think those with interests in antiquing and artisanal arts will like this cozy series the most, especially if they are from the southern U.S.The author always does it right!

One is a widower business investor, the other a playboy property developer.

"I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  To be honest, with that silly title I wasn't expecting much.  It is a well-written clean contemporary romance featuring an Italian-American man, Antonio, and his Italian father.  The young woman who falls for Antonio's honest charms and not and just his good looks, Laura Beth, benefits from the relationship just as much Antonio does.""He was a good man, with a big heart and so much talent she almost couldn't fathom it.""That Antonio is in line to inherit his father's millions, and that he lives the life of a millionaire, is not really that important of a factor in the couple's growing relationship.  This is very refreshing in a genre seemingly flooded with women prostituting themselves to be with millionaires and billionaires. (I received this book as a review-copy.)We see the story from two points of view, Antonio's and Laura Beth's, with a third-person limited narration.  But at times the author uses an omniscient narrator.  Both characters are given interesting back stories, shaping their present selves into convincing people.  For my tastes, I found the book spent too much time in the characters' minds, growing repetitive at times, and there was too little action taking place, but that is often the style with this genre.The couple have known each other for years, and have always felt an attraction, but the timing of life's events has always been off.  This makes their inevitable coupling seem more convincing than in those stories that want us to believe in a couple's happily-ever-after, after only a few weeks of knowing each other.Part of the story takes place in the States, and part of the story happens in Italy's region of Tuscany.  We even have a quick jaunt to Barcelona, Spain.  The author gives us a satisfying finish.  But there are several themes left unresolved after the abrupt ending of this novella-length book:  Antonio's painting and his career, her career, where the couple will live...  One more chapter would have completed the story of this modern Mr. Rochester/Jane Eyre nicely for me.Please read my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YYJPCE63HYFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O92RPQW#wasThisHelpful","R2YYJPCE63HYFE","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book attempts to cover 3000 years of history in 400 pages, so you can't blame this writer for suffering a sort-of history-whiplash.  Hundreds of years are compressed into a single page, over and over again.  Tidbits and trivia are sprinkled throughout to try to keep the reader's interest, and to differentiate the book from a Wikipedia entry on The History of Rome, Italy.  I'm not sure the trivia actually works.The author works hard to focus his story on the city of Rome, but that is difficult since the city was once the capital of an empire, and is now the capital of a country, and it is the capital of a religious faith.  Take any name, date or event mentioned in this compressed history book, and you will find dozens of books in print about it.  The history of Rome and her citizens and invaders is so rich that this books sometimes feels more like an Index than a book.The book boasts a detailed Notes and Index section.  In fact, the Notes section feels like a book in its own right.  Perhaps the book that the author should have written?  I don't know, but in the Preface the author states that the book is intended for those who may tour Rome.  The book hopes to offer some historical background to what visitors to modern Rome may see.  The Notes section points out just what bits and pieces are still to be seen, and includes some teasing information about them.Sadly, modern Rome is like ancient and medieval Rome after they have been put through a blender and mashed with a potato masher and then buried in your back garden.  There is not much left where it originally stood, or in its original condition.  Tourists to Rome have to deal with traffic, pollution, filth and graffiti, lines and crowding, to see collections and buildings that are like jigsaw-puzzles made up of bits and pieces, or missing bits and pieces.I cringed right at the beginning of this book when I read the author thank his wife solely for her Index-making skills.  Ouch.  Cold.  The male-of-a-certain age feeling remained throughout the reading of the book, especially when mentions of women resorting to prostitution in order to survive were treated as moments of amusement or curiosity.Wouldn't the readers find it so amusing to hear Samuel Johnson's Boswell's precise words about how he abused Roman women resulting in his infamous venereal disease?  No, this reader did not find it amusing, as I suspect no female readers found it amusing, and perhaps many men did not find it very nice either.  The diary quotes were not uninteresting per se, but they seemed too many and too much of another era to be entertaining.  Actually, some things about that other era provoked my envy:  Rome was open, inexpensive and often free for well-educated tourists.The author has a fluid prose style and a command of his subject matter, although he his fond of historical gossip and probable invented innuendo.  He also has an academic's studied disdain for religion, which will annoy if not offend those of faith.  That was an odd thing to indulge when writing a book that would surely interest religious pilgrims to the home of Catholicism and the Christian faiths, and to the sites of so many religious martyrs, including two apostles of Jesus.The author keeps the 3000 years moving along at a quick pace.  We retrace Rome's long history of bloodshed and sadism, ruinous ambition, rampant misogyny, aristocratic destructive narcissism, invasion by thugs, looting by everyone and anyone.  It does become tiresome after a while.The overall feeling from reading the book, for me, was this is too much history in too short a book.  3000 years in 400 pages; do the math and that is an average of 7.5 years per page.  That would be the history of Fascist Italy on one page.  You see what I mean?  Actually, the author allows a chapter to cover Royals and Fascists, but that means some pages cover hundreds of years of history.  All of post WWII Rome is summed up in the Epilogue.Please read my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17V59LVGJ2BT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140070788#wasThisHelpful","R17V59LVGJ2BT4","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hit and Nun and the Lucille Mystery Series is for cozy mystery fans who also love slapstick humor.  Lucille, a fifty-year-old Italian-American woman and grandmother, who is happily married to her childhood sweetheart, is the unlikely protagonist of this slapstick cozy series (3 books to date).Lucille's family loves their Italian food and they follow the big Sunday dinner tradition that many hyphenated Italians enjoy.  Italian food plays a big part in their lives.  Lucille is particularly fond of Italian dishes, and she prepares plenty of them for her family, as she has since first getting married to her Italian-American husband.  Lucille's Roman Catholic faith also plays a big role in her life and in the books.Cozies stay away from violence, sex, gore and disturbing subjects.  That is why I was surprised that the author included disturbing mammograms and a threat of breast cancer in Hit and Nun.  For personal reasons, I found those scenes and that storyline disturbing.  If I were not reading the book to review it here, as a review-copy, I would have stopped reading.  If you are sensitive to these subjects for reasons of your own, you may want to avoid this book in the series.  There are also lots of references to the negatives of aging, which some readers may find upsetting.There is lots of humor in Hit and Run, much of it physical humor.  But the verbal humor is there too, in abundance.  The folksy style might wear on some readers, but if you enjoy it, you will appreciate the verbal humor in the story more.Please read my full and illustrated review at Italophile Book Reviews.http://italophilebookreviews.blogspot.nl/2015/01/hit-and-nun-by-peg-cochran.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEMGNIIJT34B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW5Q6HW#wasThisHelpful","RHEMGNIIJT34B","AP13TVHX5YK8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP13TVHX5YK8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have two cats, and two litter boxes to go with them. Before we had this litter catching mat, I was constantly sweeping up litter that would get tracked further into the house. I had to sweep at least three times a day, and it was slowly driving me crazy! This mat works wonders, it is the perfect size, and most of the litter ends up trapped in the mat instead of all over my house. I will periodically take it outside and whack all the litter out, and its good as new! I have even hosed it off a few times, left it outside for a few hours to dry, and it looks great. This is a great mat if you have messy cats like I do! I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions.

"If you're looking for affordable, good sounding, wireless, in-ear headphones with sensible volume and track control for occasional listening then check these out. I have been using them for about a week. They connect easily and have very few instances where the connection is disturbed enough to cause audio skips. The battery lasts about 5 hours or more of intermittent use which I don't think is too bad for an hour and a half or so of charge time. They're perfect for working out or commuting on the bus/train. I wouldn't recommend them for someone hoping to use them through a whole day though, the battery might not make it. I really like the ability to change the volume on the headphones and change tracks with a long press of the same buttons. Also, the weight and fit of them work for me. They are about as heavy as I expected considering all the stuff packed into them and they don't fall out of my ear, even during a workout. I do need to adjust them for a bit when I first put them in. I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions. Overall, I wouldn't call them premium wireless headphones, but they are a solid product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CT3YVIA3QHCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KSWV4K#wasThisHelpful","R1CT3YVIA3QHCQ","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been buying the bottled protein smoothies at my gym, but they tend to very expensive and full of mystery ingredients. I decided to make my own using this protein powder and my shaker bottle. I use mango puree, protein powder, water, yogurt, lemon juice, honey and have no complaints about the result. Shaking the bottle vigorously for a minute or two gets everything in solution. And it tastes just as good as the ones at the gym. My goal is to get the protein boost and keep the sugar and calories low. This is an easy way to achieve that end.Its also great for cooking with. I can add a scoop to my waffle & pancake recipes, muffins, and other recipes. I have tried some protein powders that tasted pretty bad but I'll buy this again because it's awesome and tastes great.

"We have to haul our laundry a fair distance to a laundry mat about every two weeks. This is perfect for us.  I was previously using one of those cheap pop-up collapsible hampers from the dollar store and it was constantly tipping over and all my dirty laundry was scattered on the floor.  I love this hamper.  It comes in a pack of two, which is great for my husband and I.  These hamper are strong, durable and I like that they pop up. I leave one in my closet and one in the bathroom and use them as hampers til laundry day. When you are ready to take it along with you, you just pop them up and head to the laundry. Love how efficient and compact these are, without sacrificing quality.  I really needed a new hamper and I'm just so glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions. Fantastic set of two hampers!  I can imagine someone with small kids can use this to store toys in as well or come up with other uses instead of just for dirty clothes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CX70B5D75LNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W1ZRYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CX70B5D75LNS","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The rack is really well-made and heavy-duty. I was able to carry it from outside to inside when it was covered in damp clothes and it still didn't fall apart. It is easy to put up and take down, but does not fall closed easily when you don't want it to. We have a small balcony in our home and its gets really hot so this is ideal for air drying your clothes and saving money at the laundromat.  I feel like my clothes are fresher when I air dry them too.  I like this rack so much that I will use it daily outside at home in the summer.  I was surprised by how large it was, I couldn't see how big it was in the pic online but when I opened it was a pleasant surprise.  I am able to fit all my wet clothes in there to dry, all at once.  This is great for when you are hand-washing your delicate items as well.  I used to dry them in the bathtub but this is much more efficient.  I like how its easy to fold close and put away for storage when you are not using it.

"This is a very useful, beautiful, high quality organizer that can be used for cosmetics or jewelry. It's made of 100% acrylic and is heavy duty. I love how its transparent so you can see whats stored without even opening it.  It's a very stylish organizer. The organizer is actually two stacking pieces. the top part of this organizer is removable. It has enough space for eyeliner, mascara, lipsticks, lip balms, nail polishes, brushes, etc. It's very sturdy and stays in place well. The bottom portion has four drawers- two small and two larger drawers. They open and close easily. They're prefect for storing earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc. They have removable paddings that keep jewelry in place. I have this organizer in my bedroom and it's compact and doesn't take up a lot of space. It's a very nice way to keep my jewelry and makeup organized in one spot. I can wake up and everything is at my fingertips. Perfect for grabbing something on my way to the office.

"I really like this lightweight sleeping bag to take with me on our backpacking and camping trips.  I went on my first backpacking trip and unfortunately didn't realize that there were different types of sleeping bags.  I brought the kind that you would bring to a sleepover at a friends house, not the kind you need to pack along with you on a hike.  I'm so glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions. Its large enough for most adults or kids.  I can easily see a larger man being able to fit in this sleeping bag with ease.  Its relatively thin which makes it ideal for traveling, especially if you are backpacking.  It takes up very little space too, about the size of a toiletry bag when packed.  I used it to sleep in and it does a pretty good job of keeping you secure and warm.  If you want to be a little more comfortable you can pair it with a sleeping bag liner, but I used it on its own.  It works good for the purpose.  This type of sleeping bag is ideal for outdoor use, when camping or backpacking.  Highly recommended and its priced very reasonably as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RHACM2UZ03KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VS8J5Q#wasThisHelpful","R1RHACM2UZ03KQ","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wallet I had for over 5 years and it was completely worn out and old. I'm so glad I had a chance to test this wallet for my review. It's nice and slim yet  all my credit cards, my license, and my cash. I like that there is a flap for my license so that I don't have to pull it out each time to show a clerk. The leather is nice and luxurious. Best of all is the RFID protection. The wallet blocks the signal from being intercepted. I tested it with my train pass and it actually works. I like that it is RFID protection because a lot of my new credit cards have chips in it. I like that this wallet is priced very reasonably the quality is very good and its like a designer wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZIH7FB3J3NHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3SC0VY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZIH7FB3J3NHK","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has a lot of information in it for such a small book. The language is easy enough for a beginner to understand but not so simplistic that anyone with some astrology knowledge won't be interested.  I had very limited knowledge of astrology, with my only encounter with it being the love horoscopes on the back of fashion magazines.  This really explains what astrology is, and where astrology comes from (birth charts and planets), and how to apply it to your life.  One of the key focus of this book is the birth chart and its actually quite relevant if you have your birth chart with you when you are reading this book.  It makes the reading material much more applicable to you.  I was able to get mine prepared from a local astrologer, but there are websites that you can get your done as well.  I would highly recommend having your birth chart prior to reading this book.  This book goes over a very technical subject but its actually quite fun and interesting.  I liked reading the basic attributes of each zodiac sign and applying it to my friends and relatives with that sign.  Its actually quite remarkable how accurate real astronomy is. I learned a lot from this book and its the kind of book that should be shared with friends/family after reading.  I like this book for a beginners book and recommend it to anyone who wants to get their feet wet.

"Telescopes are a lot of fun as long as you know how to use it.  Unfortunately most of us never learn to use a telescope and it isn't something that's taught in school.  I ordered an awesome telescope from amazon and although the manual tells you how to use it, it doesn't explain what you should be looking at.  That is where this book comes in handy.  I really like how fun and educational this book is.  It goes into detail 50 celestial bodies that are discoverable with a home telescope.  Its an easy-to-read book that even kids will enjoy.  Each celestial body is listed with it's individual visibility rating, the season it's visible, quality of celestial body with a home telescope, the distance from earth, and direction on how to view it.  My favorite section is the significance part, where you learn new and interesting facts about the celestial body.  It even has a little blip about the origin of the celestial body and some pop culture references.  Although this book is best used with a home telescope its good enough to be read standalone, for anyone who has a keen interest in outer space.  I highly recommend this good and educational book for anyone who owns a home telescope.  Its a perfect companion.  Most importantly, its easy for both kids and adults to read.  Highly recommended.

"I have never used a telescope before but I have always wanted one.  I'm not a very technical person, but I was able to set this telescope up very easily.  The manual is very easy to understand with plenty of diagrams.  Once I set it up I was ready to use it.  Unfortunately where I live there is a massive amount of light pollution and we usually don't have any visibility to stars.  I do have some lovely mountain ranges surrounding me and I was able to take the kids out to see the mountain ranges.  I love that we are finally able to see the remote distances in such clarity.  I am simply amazed at the quality and durability of this telescope, I have never really used on before, but this one is amazing. Very sturdy and well-built.  It‚Äôs a perfect starter telescope to help kids get interested in nature and astronomy.  The legs are adjustable with make it easy for kids to access the viewfinder.  Very clear and easy to focus when looking through. Love that the aluminum tripod is adjustable and very sturdy. It comes with 2 different sized lenses as well, which is a plus. Overall, I am very pleased with this telescope.  It‚Äôs much better investment than a toy or video game, it‚Äôs very and something they can use at any age.  Highly recommended.

"This magnetic knife bar is a great way to safety store and display your knives ! I have been wanting one for forever especially since seeing how useful and organized they are in restaurant kitchens. I was able to purchase mine at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I jumped at the chance. The magnet on this bar is very strong and had no problem holding my knives. And it also came with the hardware you need to install. Storing your knives on a knife bar is much safer than storing them in a drawer where you can cut yourself. You can easily see what you have at a glance and grab conveniently. This bar is useful for other metal kitchen tools and gadgets also. But don't limit yourself just to your kitchen. You can use this bar in your craft/sewing room, garage, workshop, storage room, etc. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0347VX8DJFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0120VW61C#wasThisHelpful","R1I0347VX8DJFV","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always skeptical about face cleansers and masks because my face is so sensitive that it can just have a reaction to anything (I'll break out into huge hives for weeks). I had a chance to test this for my review and I decided to give it a try. I followed the directions completely. I wasn't sure if you were supposed to dry your face before or dampen it, so I just put it straight into my dry face (still not sure to be honest). I waited 7 minutes and used the 2 minutes to massage. OH MY GOSH. While I was rinsing it out I could instantly feel how smooth my skin was. I'm currently writing this review right after that, so I'll give it 24 hours to see if I break out into hives (fingers crossed I don't!), but so far I don't see any signs of a reaction.  So glad I ordered this because my face feels as smooth as a baby's bottom!

"Impressive sound quality from a comfortable, well designed pair of bluetooth headphones. They're very lightweight, and they're well balanced (they don't feel like they're always trying to fall out), which makes them very wearable (they stay in place, even when I'm being particularly active, and are comfortable for even long periods). They have pretty good battery life (I used it for over an hour of music with constant playback), which is pretty impressive, because they weigh so little.  The controls work surprisingly well, which is kind of unexpected - I'm more accustomed to the horrible corded inline mic/control combos that have one button that's supposed to play/pause/skip (but more often than not, just stops playback, or starts playing something random). These headphones work really well.  I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions.

I will definitely consider buying more in the near future, as I would love to eventually replace my plastic wrap with these.

"These socks are great socks, they are not too warm and comfortable to wear.  These keep your feet dry during long wear and gives air at the same time.  They are made of high quality material for a great wear and comfort. My husband wears these all day for school and sports and these just make a huge difference when he comes home and those shoes come off no stench, no sweat, and best of all no blisters.  These are really a great product. I received these socks for product testing purposes, and have been very please with my test. I recommend these socks, not to mention the price is great for 3 pairs, you cant beat that !!! These are medium thickness and wash up so well. I love that they have a small strip of glue on the inside, to prevent them for falling down during the day.  I noticed that many of my no-show socks tend to fall, so this is a great addition I have never seen in any other socks. My guys love these, this was a nice pack of socks and have been great from everything from basketball games, to wearing to work, or just around the house. I like that they are nice and supportive socks that won't fall down throughout the work day.  Highly recommended!We had originally split the pack up and were sharing them but I'm fairly sure the hubs has commandeered all of them for his work wardrobe. If he can't find a pair of these particular socks he will go on the hunt and take them from our drawers. Believe me, I hear about it when he can't find a pair too. I think we could use another set or two, they have proven to be very durable and reliable and we have not had one issue with seams or threads being loose. They fit like the best kind you can buy on the store, but I find them to be better than one of the big expensive brands that we have tried, because they aren't getting loose around the ankles at all. I purchased these at a discount in order to try them and I would definitely purchase them again, even at full price. I have not always had great experiences shopping smaller brands for socks but I now know this is a brand we can rely on to hold up. I would recommend them to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZH2Z9PJLSCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG249PA#wasThisHelpful","R2RZH2Z9PJLSCY","AFKJY2RA6RC4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFKJY2RA6RC4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The backpack is great and beyond better quality than I had expected. The sellers is great as well. I absolutely love this cute emoji backpack.  I got it just in time for back-to-school which was amazing. I was actually surprised how quickly it arrived.  Emoji pattern items are so popular this year, with emoji socks, shirts, leggings, hats etc.  I was so happy to have a chance to test and review this emoji backpack.  I wasn't expecting the backpack to be so well-built but its very nice and sturdy.  I'm a college student and this backpack is so unique, I get so many compliments about it around campus.  The backpack is a great size, I can fit my binders and books in there perfectly with room to spare. The front pocket is great for your pens and pencils or anything else you can think of since it is also quite spacious. I also keep my phone and calculator in the front pocket because its easy to take out and find. The backpack is also surprisingly durable! It has a nice thick fabric that is also very soft and comfortable. I love the feeling of it, not too heavy and very soft on your shoulders. The pattern came out great, not blurry or anything. The color was very close to the image on the screen. I love this backpack!

"These are great pills that combine the good effects of many herbs and vitamins such as olive leaf, oregano oil, caprylic acid, goldenseal, and ceylon cinnamon.  These herbal supplements are a wonderful way to keep your kidneys healthy and to keep UTIs away. I usually drink cranberry juice, but don't want to drink it every day, so this is a great alternative. They are easy enough to swallow and they don't have a funky taste like some other supplements I have tried.  I am taking them as a preventative measure and they seem to be working good as I have not gotten any infections.  They come in a HUGE bottle which are priced very reasonably.  I like this size bottle because I can buy the bottle once and forget about reordering for the next few months.  I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions. Highly recommended.

"This is a very good quality coffee and spice grinder. The button on my old grinder broke, so I had been stuck using my manual grinder, which works well but is terribly slow.  I like this one so much.  It feels nice and sturdy and doesn't tip over.  The lid is clear so you can observe your spices and coffee being grinded to your liking.  The inner bowl is removable which makes this machine so easy to wipe up.  It came with a nice brush to dust away any remnants.  I like how modern this machine looks, I like to keep it out on my counter top because it looks so nice.  I mostly cook only Indian food so I often need freshly ground spices.  I use this to make homemade garam masala which can be whipped up so easily and tastes so much better and more potent than the jarred varieties. I've even noticed its a lot more quieter than my previous grinder, which sounded like a lawnmower or chainsaw.

"This little pump is very well made and works exactly like it's supposed to. I have used it on Schrader and presta valve bicycle tires up and it works with great ease. I really can't believe how quickly it works for being such a small pump. I had a mini pump that I bought from walmart and it was terrible and broke quickly. This one is very well made of quality materials. My brother and I go on long bike rides together and its so nice to have to have my own pump now instead of sharing the one in his pack! I really like the price I got for it as well! Its easy enough for the kids to use on their own. I never really liked my kids using my heavy duty heavy bike pump that I keep in the garage. I like how this straps securely to my frame instead of taking up space in my pack. More room for tubes and snacks!

"If you're looking for a ridiculously bright bike light... Look no further! The SUPERBRIGHT USB Rechargeable Bike Light is the brightest I've ever used, and I've tried a lot of bike lights!!! I can't even really describe how bright it is... But, think of a miniature headlight, and that's about right. This light also has a wide range, so when you're cycling at night, you're able to see the whole road ahead of you. The light is extremely well made, and is made for quality and longevity. It's an exceptional product, and I highly recommend it! Plus, the bulbs are LED, so they consume less power, but out off a brighter, cleaner light. This means you get an amazingly bright light, and the charge last a lot longer!

"This towel really dries fast. Its not like regular towels that seem to take hours to dry.  I like how effective it is in drying myself off.  Much more effective than a standard cotton towel.I love this towel and I use it to dry myself off after showering at the gym after excersizing everyday. I first towel my hair off after showering, and work my way down. By the time I am done with my hair the towel is already rather damp. However, it still works well drying the rest of my body. This towel does not leave small fibers on my body after I use it to dry myself, unlike other types of ""quick-dry"" towels I have used before. I use it everyday, and I leave it to dry in my gym locker, only bringing it home to wash at the end of the week. I like that there is no smell when I reuse it.

"I usually have trouble getting a good or comfortable fit with in-ear headphones; either they hurt my ears, even with the soft covers, or they fall out with the slightest movement. I really like the design of these headphones because they don't fall out nor are they uncomfortable. I thought the wood was only there for aesthetic purposes, but it serves a function in improving sound quality. The sound is incredibly good through these headphones, and since they fit so well I'm able to listen at a lower volume than with other models. I like listening to music when I'm studying at the library, but I like keeping the music low enough that no one else can hear.I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try this product and to give my thoughts and opinions.

"It's been raining lately so I haven't been able to use this to wash/dry my car, but I use it for cleaning jobs inside the home. This mitt is great for quick wipe down jobs. I have lots of indoor pets and it grabs the shed hair and holds on to it. It is super absorbent. There's not a whole lot to say about this beyond the fact that it does well the job that it is advertised to do. It can even be used inside-out, both sides for different spots--one side is textured, like a shag microfiber rug and the other side is only slightly textured and mostly flat. It's useful for dresser tops, baseboards, ceiling fan blades and anything else that gets dusty. It's a good size--plenty of room but not so big that it's falling off my hand.

Honestly, half the time, if I don't carefully blow out and straighten, I feel like cousin it. No more. I just tested out Surf spray. I tried it out for two weeks, and it is a MIRACLE for hair like mine.Just wash, spritz, and go. When you're hair air dries, you'll have loose, gorgeous, beachy waves. Or even better, wash your hair, and go to sleep. You'll wake up with perfect bedhead! Even better, if you're feeling lazy, and wake w/ bad hair, skip a wash and spritz this in.

Also, have traveled with the bottle and it does not leak. This stuff is saving my hair. It feels like I got a deep treatment conditioner after applying it. I use it every time I get out of the shower now. Love it! I have thicker, wavy, chemically treated hair.

"As someone who is not naturally inclined to be a caregiver, I found this book by Stevens and Stone to be extremely helpful in preparing for the role of being the primary caregiver of my dad who is going through some pretty tough health issues right now. It helped me organize the myriad of thoughts that I couldn't quite wrap my head around when I was first thrust into the role of caregiver and derive a prioritized to-do list from them. For this reason alone, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who will be undertaking caregiving responsibilities soon and isn't feeling very confident about meeting the demands of this role.But, if I didn't also mention the second reason why I think so highly of this book, I would be doing this book's potential readers a disservice. To be an effective caregiver, not only do you need to know what to do in specific situations, you also need to know how to deal with the stress associated with being responsible for an ailing person's well-being. Stevens and Stone excel in this area by providing effective techniques that caregivers can use to manage their stress levels and not be overwhelmed by what is expected of them.Are you going to be responsible for an ailing person's health anytime soon? If yes, you should definitely read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCLG1Y7HSQU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006A98TZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1DCLG1Y7HSQU7","A399A5TYGQOP0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A399A5TYGQOP0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've always considered myself to be fairly health-conscious. But, after reading this informative guide by John McQuilkin, I became aware of how much I did not know about heart disease.The author does a splendid job of exploring the causes and types of heart disease before delving into treatment options. Where the book really shines is in its discussion of nutritional strategies that people can use to prevent and/or remedy this condition.

"Although I think the idea of ""You Stock"" is somewhat limited by how attractive or distinctive-looking the business owner is, I do think that Alina Vincent has the right idea in this book. Using generic photographs is indeed one of the worst things an entrepreneur can do if she wants to differentiate her brand from the competition. Instead, she will probably be better off using photos of herself in her flyers, brochures, and book covers.But, of course, there has to be a fit between the brand image an entrepreneur is trying to sell and the value proposition of conveyed by his image. If you look like the guy next door, and you try to use your image to market your high-end, niche offering to consumers, you'll need to very strategic and creative before you can use your likeness to successfully market your offering. In fact, you might even need a healthy dose of good luck.The ""You Stock"" approach might not be an ideal solution for all entrepreneurs.

Alina Vincent and Christine Whitmarsh will not only tell you why your brand needs constant public attention, but also show you how to weave a story involving your brand that people simply cannot resist talking about.As a former brand manager and a self-published author, I think ""Personal Paparazzi"" is a fantastic resource for individuals who need some guidance on how to effectively market their businesses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDT1D2OBAJU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR1S856#wasThisHelpful","R1IDT1D2OBAJU9","A399A5TYGQOP0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A399A5TYGQOP0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I mentioned in my review of Marie F Crow‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Risen: Dawning, Anniversary Edition‚Äù, her storytelling technique is simply unmatched in the zombie books genre.Unfortunately, most zombie book authors tend to overemphasize the blood and gore while not taking enough time to thoroughly develop the characters and the storyline.

"As I've gotten older, I've noticed that the fine lines under my eyes have become more prominent. When my girlfriend suggested that I use this product, at first I balked at her suggestion. But, after one of my best friends (who by the way is a total meathead) admitted to me that he's been using an eye serum for over a year, I thought that maybe I should just swallow my pride.This product is lightweight like most of the other eye serums I've used. I use it before I go to bed. One little dab on the finger is enough for each eye. What I really like about this eye gel is that although it seems to just glide on, it really does get into the fine lines under my eyes. After about a week of using it, I noticed that the fine lines under my eyes pretty much disappeared.I don't like spending too much on eye creams, but I'm glad I took a chance on this product.

"The last time I went hiking, I was ten years younger. Despite being in peak physical condition, I struggled to keep going because the weight of my backpack was too much; in it were ten bottles of Gatorade. Clearly, I hadn't given much thought to how heavy my backpack would become as a result of carrying such a large amount of fluids.I'd like to think I'm a bit wiser now. The older and wiser me is a big fan of doing his homework before the s*** hits the fan. Naturally, I gravitated towards this book.Whether you're a hiker or someone who lives in an area that is prone to being hit by a natural disaster a little too frequently for your liking, you will appreciate the author's eloquently stated message in this book - go lightweight in emergency situations.Another thing about this book that fascinated me was its detailed examination of handguns and ammunition. Being anti-NRA, I've simply never thought about the need to have firepower in emergency situations. Still, I found Thompson's discussions of guns to be fascinating.Whether you're a hiker, a couch potato, a member of the NRA, or anti-guns, consider reading this informative and fascinating book.

"PROS: This repeater does what it is supposed to do, which is extend the reach of the WiFi signal from your main router.  Our house is not particlarly large (I do wish I had a 5,000 square foot home, like some of the reviewers seem to have), but the problem we encountered is that one of the prior owners had built an extension, and between the extension and the main house was an exterior wall.  For some reason, the main router's signal did not do a good job of penetrating that exterior (now interior) wall to provide coverage into the extension.  I mean there was some coverage, but streaming video from, let's say, Hulu Plus was really annoying.  You had to move the computer so many times and had to perform so many crazy tricks that it harkened back to the days (and I am dating myself here) when people used to put tin foil on the TV antennas (does anyone remember those?) and hold them in their hands to watch the news.  It was THAT bad.This repeater has eliminated that problem completely.  Not only does my HP running Windows 7 receive a perfectly fine signal (5 bars), but my wife's MacBook Pro also gets a rather strong signal now (alternates between 4 and 5 bars when before it received none) and my friend's iPad (which probably has the worst wireless card of the three) also gets internet access in the extension.Set up was surprisingly easy.  I am not a techie, but I followed the instructions and was up and running in about ten minutes.  No calls to technical support were needed, and if you follow the instructions on a Windows 7 computer, you will be just fine.  To repeat, I was very pleasantly surprised with how easy this was to set up after just following the instructions.CONS: So why four stars?  Well, the Hulu Plus streaming works pretty well, but if I am streaming in HD (720), there will be at least one hang up during the show.  Then you wait for about half a minute and then it resets and you are fine.  Not that big of a deal, but annoying nevertheless, there should be no hang ups at all.  If you set it at ED (420), there are no hang ups, but the picture is slightly fuzzier, so there is a trade off I'd rather not make.Another thing is that the security on this repeater is slightly lower than that of the main server.  Usually I get them confused, but one is WEP and the other is WPA, and I think that this repeater has the lower security.  While this usually is a non-issue, if you are streaming program such as MS Office onto your computer from a secured site, it would not stream properly, or at least it didn't for me as I kept getting corrupted files.  This problem seemed to be resolved when I brought the computer over to a place where it could receive a signal from the main router.So, there you have it, a very nice repeater, with a couple of things to consider.  For me, at this price, after looking at what's available in the market at this price range, it seems like the issues that this repeater may have (which are occassional and minimal) are somewhat easier to live with than those of other repeaters that cost the same or more, but that decision is up to you.Best of luck to you with your shopping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13H4ND7WJE0YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NBL9WK#wasThisHelpful","R13H4ND7WJE0YI","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was a colossal disappointment.  It did not increase my wireless range at all.  After installing it my wireless signal went from one bar to . . . one bar.  Absolutely no change.This product comes with two antennas a shorter one and a longer one, both of which made absolutely no difference.  I used this with an HP laptop running Windows 7 that had a pretty highly rated wireless card.  The HP showed no improvement in the signal that it received.  In fact, at some points, it seemed as if the HP did better without this antenna installed because the wireless card that came with the laptop was so strong.Of course, like everyone else, I read the positive reviews and believed them, which led me to purchase this antenna.  Unfortunately, my laptop did not benefit from attaching this antenna.  However, there was a noticeable and significant improvement in signal when I installed a wireless repeater, but that is a story for a different review.  I would advise anyone with a signal problem to skip this garbage and buy a wireless repeater that will help all of their products (tablets, cell phones, etc.) get wifi from a longer distance and is well worth the few additional dollars over the cost of this product.If I could give this antenna zero stars I would.  There were issues with the driver and the fact that it blinks and makes you think that it is working, but is actually doing nothing that are tremendously frustrating with this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFM29ZETDPPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035H4164#wasThisHelpful","RYFM29ZETDPPE","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good, but not great P&S.  If you have realistic expectations, you'll probably be happy with it.  If you think you are getting a DSLR type photo quality in this package, you should think again.We bought this camera when we had lost our Canon SD 800 IS, which, at the time it came out was one of Canon's top of the line cameras.  Because we had a graduation, I went to a store with a reasonable return policy (in case we found the SD 800, which we did later).  I ended up taking about 200 pictures with this camera.  Here are some thoughts:Size - this camera is incredible small.  About the size of a Blackberry phone.  Easily pocketable.Zoom - one of the most useful zoom ranges in any pocket camera 24-120 is a sweet sweet zoom spot.Grip - we had the black with the textured feel.  I liked it, but my wife didn't much care for it.  Try before you buy.Photo quality - while the pictures were generally pretty good, I thought that this camera would blow away the 7 MP SD 800s photos, but for the most part, it did not.The amazing thing about this camera is that on Auto mode, which is how most people would use it, there were a couple of outside shots that were unbelievably amazing and remained sharp no matter how much I blew them up.  There were about 2 such pictures out of 100.  The lens needs alot of light to be at its best, and I really could not duplicate the sharpness on Auto no matter what I did.  I guess sometimes the camera's IQ is good, and sometimes, it isn't as good.Indoor shots are okay, but there was marginal, if any improvement from SD 800 indoor pictures and that camera came out about 6 years ago, that's two sensor generations and one lens generation (although I think the quality of Canon's glass was better then and the sensors are better now).  As I mentioned above, we actually found the SD 800 after the graduation and I took a couple of test shots to make a comparison (because I was thinking of keeping the 300 HS).  Generally speaking, there was not that big a difference in the pictures to bother with the upgrade.Thus, for a P&S it is a good camera, but will not blow you away with the results.  However, if you are buying it just to print out 4x6, which is what we do with our SD 800, you likely will be satisfied, but if you are thinking of upgrading from a prior generation Canon P&S the difference in photo quality may not be enough to make the switch worthwhile.Best of luck in your purchasing decision!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TRW1PHII9IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J41T7Q#wasThisHelpful","R31TRW1PHII9IG","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this based on Consumer Reports' recommendations, installed and have been using this microwave for about 5 months.  So far, the microwave has been exceptional in every single way.PROS -Heating - uniform and quick, just like you would expect.Defrost - we defrosted cheese from the freezer, which usually crystallizes, and have to say, it came out pretty good.  Not as good as if you just bought it, but much better than any other microwave defrosting that we've ever seen.Ventilation - the pull out vent seemed like a gimmick, but that extra half a foot seems to make a big difference as it literally pulls the smoke away from the oven's front burners.  A very nice feature.Controls - pretty straightforward, although the more advanced features are something that we will have to get used to.Light - this microwave has two lights on either side of the stove rather than one light with two bulbs in the middle.  The lights are slightly angled so that they illuminate the entire stovetop quite well.  A very well conceived design.CONS -Handle - we had gotten used to the push button opening of the old microwave, and pulling a handle to open the door took us awhile to get used to.All in all, have to report as being quite pleased with this microwave that we purchased off Amazon.  The price was good and this, so far, has been a very nice replacement for our crappy Panasonic over the range microwave that died about two seconds after the 5 year warranty expired.Best of luck with your shopping and your purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZ91LXBBZUYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JN54QA#wasThisHelpful","RLZ91LXBBZUYA","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this bag when the price was less than $60, mainly because there simply was no other bag that looked this good for that kind of money.  Here's a quick review based on our initial impressions, as we haven't yet taken it camping, but intend to do so this summer.PROS:Construction - this is above average construction for this price range.  Like everything else, this bag is made in China.  Some of the stitching at the ends of straps is not super secure double stitching, but it doesn't seem as if it will matter, as those are not load bearing areas.  The zippers are big and chunky and don't snag.Convenience - the bag has many pockets in which to stash, hang, attach things all over the place.  Certainly some thought has gone into the design of this bag.Appearance - this is a really nice looking backpack.  Everyone who has seen it has commented positively on its appearance.Size - very very large backpack for this price range.  Don't be fooled by the pictures, it is very large.Extras - the detachable top and the rain cover are very nice extras.CONS:Weight - the bag is heavy.  The bag alone easily weights 5lbs or more, not a bag you want or need for a two to three day trip with alot of hiking.Size - while this is also a pro, and we haven't yet used it, unless you are a camper who tends to take alot of extra stuff this might be more bag than you need.Sleeping Bag Compartment - this is pretty small.  You would be able to easily stuff a child sleeping bag in this, but you couldn't easily do that for a larger adult sleeping bag without some kind of compression.  Not a deal killer, because there's lots of room in the bag, but something to be aware of.NEUTRAL:Comfort - bag feels comfortable and has lots of padding.  However, haven't yet carried the bag fully packed.At less than $60, this is a no brainer (at least in my opinion).  Once you start getting close to $80, there are other bags out there, but from what I have seen, this remains one of the stronger contenders in the value priced bag category.Hope this helps and happy shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMCFUAESB0NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C3ZNS2#wasThisHelpful","R1AMCFUAESB0NP","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this based on the Consumer Reports review.  Have had it for over two months in a cold winter and a dry room.  In sum, this is a very good humidifier with some annoying deficiencies.Pros:Humidity - lots and lots of humidity.  This thing works alot better than any of those drug store humidifiers that you will find for $30-$40 and then break after a couple of years.  It really generates a ton of humidity and is really exceptional in that regard.Directional misters - the directional misters are terrific and work well.  We have the humidifier in a corner and the whole room gets the humidity because we direct the misters right to the middle of the room even though the humidifier is in the corner.Low sound - this humidifier is very very quiet.  After awhile, you will not notice it in the room at all.  We switched to this from a heating element humidifier that finally broke down on us, and that humidifier, which literally boiled water, sounded like a lawnmower next to this one.  Extremely quiet, especially based on the amount of humidity that it generates.Neutral:Analog controls - this is a matter of personal preference.  Every humidifier I ever had with digital controls broke, mainly because the controls broke, so I prefer analog controls, but some people like the digital.  For that reason, I'm putting it as a neutral, but for me it is a plus.Cons:Filter - I don't like filters and this is no exception.  First off, you still have to clean the humidifier.  You may have to clean it less often than a humidifier without a filter, but you still have to clean it.  After two months - with the filter - our humidifier has developed some mineral accumulations.Filter cost - the filter costs for this unit are outrageous.  $30 for the filter is simply unacceptable, as for the price of two filters I could buy another humidifier.Warm mist - the warm mist on this is a joke.  On the ""warm"" setting, the mist comes out room temperature.  On the cold setting, the mist is a little cooler than that.  This is not a true dual-temperature humidifier, so prepare to be underwhelmed.  If you really want warm mist, then you may need to buy a humidifier based on a heating element rather than this one.CONCLUSION -A very very good, but not great humidifier that performs its main function - i.e.: generating humidity - extremely well.  Where it goes awry are the in the details, the lack of a true warm mist, the so-so filter and the ridiculously high filter cost.  But there is no perfect humidifier, so make your decision accordingly.

"Bought this battery to replace my prior battery which would hold a charge for only 6 hours at a time.The battery I bought from this seller looks like new OEM and has a manufacture date of January 2010, which is pretty good.  This battery holds a charge for about three days on the Motorola W385 phone.  By comparison, when I first bought the phone, the battery that came with the phone held a charge for about 5 days.  But I am happy with the 3 days on a charge here.I highly recommend this seller.  There were some hiccups, but the seller fixed them all and their customer service was responsive and thoughtful.All in all, a good transaction and a very good battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAPYFLKG6VQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026LP2AY#wasThisHelpful","R2QAPYFLKG6VQQ","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have been using computers for nearly two decades and have owned both PCs and Macs.  Use a PC laptop for work, which is great for that.  But this is my first Mac laptop and I have to say, while I was grumbling at the price, you get what you pay for.  Here are my thoughts.PROS -Trackpad --- this may be the best thing about this computer.  While I read the review on CNET and they said the trackpad is great, you really have to experience it to understand.  It is a transformational way of communicating with the computer.  After having the computer for about a week, I am already much faster on this trackpad than I ever was on a mouse.  You have to experience this to understand.  The size and the functionality built into the trackpad are nothing short of astonishing.Included software --- the included software on iLife is really useful.  It has a rather full featured movie editing software for free, as well as iPhoto, iTunes, etc.Not included bloatware --- it is nice not to have to delete all that crap from the desktop and windows system.Fast --- very fast, especially in OSX.  We got this with zero options, just the base 15"" model.  It is very quick with anything you throw at it.Build quality --- you can grab this laptop from any corner and carry it.  There is no flex in the casing.  You can really feel the difference that building these things out of a solid block of aluminum makes.Looks --- this is really a beautiful machine.  You'll be as happy looking at is when it is off as when it is on.Lighted keyboard --- bright enough to see, but not too bright to be distracting.  Excellent view of all the keys in any lighting.Display --- we have the base display and it is crystal clear.  My brother-in-law got the resolution upgrade, and while you can tell a difference, if you don't have both the computers next to each other, you won't know what you are missing.  If you do intensive graphics work, I would recommend the display resolution upgrade, otherwise, it is just bragging rights, for which I don't need to pay extra.Battery life --- basically it goes all day with light use on one charge.  There are not too many 15"" laptops, if any, that can do this.Spyware and Viruses --- yes there are none now, and that is good.  Hopeuflly, there will be none for a long time.Discounts and Rebates --- while most people would not associate discounts and rebates with Apple, this is a pretty good time to buy a new Mac.  We got $200 towards an iPod Touch (making it free) and $100 towards a wireless printer (making it free).  Thus, in the end, we got a wireless printer and an iPod Touch for the cost of the tax on these products alone.  Also, if you are a teacher or work for the government, Apple will knock another $100 off the price.  These are some nice discounts when you buy this laptop.NEUTRAL -OSX --- about two years ago, this would have been a tremendous positive as Vista was an unmitigated disaster.  However, with Windows 7 being pretty good (and shamelessly ripping off many of OSX's features), this is less of an advantage than it sued to be.  It is really a matter of taste.  We happen to like OSX, especially Snow Leopard, but others may like Windows.  This computer can run both.Only two USB ports --- this is at least USB port less than the competition in this price range.  However, because the track pad is so good, I don't need to fill up a USB port with a mouse like all my friends do.  Also, since a wireless printer is about $100 (which Apple gives you towards the price of a new printer), that frees up another USB port.  Thus, I only need a USB port for the iPod or the camera.  Neither of which is connected to the laptop at all times,Only 4GB RAM --- while it is plenty for now, I can see this not being enough in a few years.No user replaceable RAM --- RAM is the cheapest way to make your computer go faster.  Hopefully the computer will still go fast after the warranty expires so that I can take this apart and add more RAM.  But it is annoying that there is no easy way to replace the RAM.No user replaceable battery --- I don't know how long the battery will last, but if a problem develops, it would be nice to be able to change the battery.CONS -No Blu-Ray --- this was the biggest drawback for me, as I would have liked to have a Blu-Ray player in the house.  However, since I don't own any Blu-Rays, it is not that big of a drawback.  Also, since you can download most movies these days, this missing player is not a deal breaker.No HDMI output --- this is another potential problem.  I don't have an HDTV, so this is not a big deal, but if I get one, it is annoying to have to buy a special adapter PLUS an HDMI cable to play video from my laptop's mini-display port on my TV.CONCLUSION -All in all, I've liked this machine alot more than I thought I would.  It feels good in the hand and great when using.  The display is terrific and the machine is quite responsive.  While it is tempting to look at a computer based exclusively on specifications, if you only do that, you may lose sight of what you need in a computer and how you use it.  All the specifications in thw world achieve nothing if they are for features that you don't use.  This computer hits a nice combination of features that people will actually use without including features and complications that they won't.  For what we need, it just works.While we looked at many laptops, we are happy we ended up with this one.Hopefully this review helped you in your computer shopping.  Best of luck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY3XXMDTVTAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003G2ZJTG#wasThisHelpful","RGY3XXMDTVTAQ","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had this phone about three months now.  If you are a Verizon customer and you don't need a smart phone, you should definitely consider this phone.  Here's the review:PROS:CALL QUALITY - as good as, if not better than, a landline.  Everywhere.  Had another Verizon phone, but it dropped calls every so often.  Not this baby.BUILD QUALITY - feels good and solid in the hand.  Nice tactile sensation on rubber exterior.  Phone does not slip out of your hand at all.BLUETOOTH - have a bluetooth Motorola headpiece and the functionality is outstanding.  Voice calling, activation, and termination are one touch simple.  Wow, technology that works as it should.  Can't believe it.DEDICATED BUTTONS - this is the first phone that I owned where each commonly used function (speakerphone, volume, voice dialing etc.) all have nicely positioned dedicated hard buttons.  It's great.  You can do what you want with this phone quickly without having to go through any menus.  A pleasure!STYLING - as plain as it is, the phone has alot of aesthetic appeal.CONS:SCREEN - INTERIOR - The interior screen's resolution is pretty crappy and the good thing about it is that you don't look at it too much.  But it does the job.NO OPINION:CAMERA, MUSIC ETC. - I don't really use these features, so I can't review them.  But, like most of you, I own a separate camera, iPod etc., so I don't need my phone to do these things.If you need a phone to make and receive phone calls wherever you might be, look no further.  It is stylish and the call quality is top notch, as good as I've ever heard on a cell phone.  A great choice for making phone calls.Best of luck on your shopping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UJJ8QXJCO47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TF0IIA#wasThisHelpful","R10UJJ8QXJCO47","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: EDITED REVIEW - TWO STARS NOT FIVE - Having seen the phone I was seduced.  Because Verizon has a 30 day try out, and having learned about a recent firmware fix that addressed the issues, I decided to try out the phone.  After having the phone for about 3 1/2 weeks I returned it because I became frustrated in using the phone.  This is one case in which the reviews were not wrong.  Here are my findings.PROS:LOOKS - this is one sexy phone.  Smaller than an iPhone but much much thicker.  About as thick as a Voyager, but otherwise smaller.  Very sleek, has a few dedicated buttons on the side (volume, etc.).  The design is very appealling.  Gets lots of comments on looks.DISPLAY - the display is incredible.  Bright, extremely well detailed and clear.  Very comparable to the best out there.  The display takes up nearly all of the face of the phone and works very very well.  The fonts chosen for all of the displays are very clear and easy to read.SLIDE OUT KEYBOARD - this is a must for me.  And this keyboard is really really good.  The side of the phone that abuts the keyboard is angled (the other side is not) to allow your fingers to type on the keyboard without hitting the phone.  That's an example of the thinking that went into putting so many features in such a small package.  The keyboard is nicely spaced and much easier to type on than that of my work Blackberry.  The keyboard slides out very nicely.SIZE - If you want a smallish phone with a touch screen, then right now, this is the only game in town.INTERNET DOWNLOADS - the internet pages come with a full HTML browser and look great.  Much better than my work Blackberry, and comparable to other good phones.  The font is really good for reading pages on the small screen, but if you need to enlarge the pages, you can just use the volume rocker (up for increasing size, down for decreasing size).  It doesn't have the wow factor of size scaling with your fingers, but it works well.  You can move the page around by moving your finger on the touch screen (just like the iPhone).VOICE DIALING - the phone has voice dialing which works very well without training.CALL QUALITY - call quality is very good, but not exceptional.  You can hear other people clearly and they can hear you.  However, the call quality is not as clear as on my wife's no-frills phone which admittedly has exceptionally good call quality.  On this phone, the call quality makes the ""Pro"" list just barely because call quality is very very important to me on a phone.NEUTRAL FACTORSPRICE - the price after rebate and taxes was less than 100, which is good for a phone of this kind right now.  However, I am used to getting free cell phones, so paying for a phone was a little annoying.SCREEN SIZE FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES- because of the phone's form factor, there is nothing that can be done about this, but the screen is a touch small for viewing internet pages, etc.  I have no problem reading the pages, but some people who will do alot of browsing might opt for a bigger screen if this will bother themOTHER FEATURES - the phone also has GPS, and a music player.  I've not tried these features yet, so I can't review them.  If I do use them, I will add them to my review, but generally, these are not features that I use on a phone.  Phone does have some other interesting features such as a tip calculator, etc., which are pretty neat to use.CONS -TOUCH SCREEN - the touch screen on the phone worked poorly after awhile.  This was even after the much vaunted firmware update.  Happily this happened to me while I was still in the 30 day period.  I got rid of this phone and went back to a hard button phone and could not be happier.  I will not get a Verizon touch screen phone unless and until the iPhone comes to Verizon.VERIZON INTERFACE - Verizon has some silly aspects to its interface that are annoying, such as the ""Get It Now"" menu being the first button on the settings menu, which you cannot change or delete.  Also, the menus have been split up for no apparent reason other than to confuse the person who buys the phone.  There is a glowing blue box in the middle of the screen, and this is a shortcut menu, but there is no indication anywhere on the phone that this is the case, so you have to learn this from the Verizon sales rep or from reading the manual, which you shouldn't have to do on a phone of this type.SPECIAL FEATURES COST - using some of the other features, GPS, Internet, etc. is an added cost if you get the basic plan (like I have) so if you don't watch yourself, you can end up with a pretty high phone bill.TOUCH SCREEN WITH SCREEN PROTECTORS - the screen protectors make the touch screen's poor response even worse.---Overall, this good choice if you want a small touch screen phone.  It gets annoying after the WOW factor wears off.  I think that the phone has some functionality, but it is in the end defeated by the really annoying touch screen.  Good, but I would suggest other better choices (Voyager, etc.)Hope this helps.  Good luck with your phone shopping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CC3W13LQLGKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00192I762#wasThisHelpful","R2CC3W13LQLGKH","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to do a little test comparing the SD 800 IS (28mm to 105 mm), SD 850 IS (35mm to 140 mm) and the Panasonic Lumix TZ4 (28mm to 280 mm).  I just wanted to make sure that I got the camera that was right for me.As part of the test, I took about 70 photos with each camera in various lighting conditions, indoor lighting behind, indoor lighting in front, outdoor, zoom, wide angle, etc.  Because I usually use only 4x6 prints, I printed all the photos in 4x6 prints at a local photo lab.  There was no post photo processing on any of the photos.  I just wanted to see the results right out of the camera so to speak.Thus, to me, the test was as real world as possible because that is how people use the camera, you don't shoot screens of color swatches, you shoot people, things, landscapes, grass, etc.  Printing it out at a photo lab let me see the pictures as best as they could be.  All cameras were set on full auto and no special modes were used for any of the shots.The results were very intersting but hardly surprising.  With the exception of a somewhat noticeable difference in the telephoto and zoom ranges, at a 4x6 size, there is essentially no discernable difference in the pictures generated by the Canon SD 850IS and the Canon SD 800IS.  There was no difference indoors, outdoors, or anywhere else.  This is not surprising, because the cameras are very very similar, use the same processor, and only differ in the lenses.The Panasonic was another story.  It exhibited performance issues, had zoom hunting, poor focus, fringing, etc. on the indoor shots.  Outside, with plenty of light, it performed very well and produced excellent photos, but because I don't shoot exclusively outside, that was a deal killer for me.  You basically cannot shoot anything moving indoors with this camera.  Based on the reviews, I understood that this camera had limitations, but did not realize how much the processor hobbled this camera's indoor performance.Here's the Review for the Panasonic Lumix TZ4:PROS:LENS: The quality and range of this lens are ideal.  That is the absolute best part of this camera.  Wide angle lens is a real treat in a point and shoot sized camera.  I shot many group shots with this camera and everyone of them fit in the picture, and I did not have to walk back any steps (or wedge myself into a corner, etc. to do it).  Also, outside, and especially outside, it is amazing what you will fit into a picture.  There is absolutely no distortion with this lens.  The outside pictures are superb.ZOOM RANGE: You will not find better.FEEL: The feel of this camera is of a well built quality piece.  The grip is excellent and it feels good in the hand.FAST: Pretty fast for a point and shoot.  Not as fast as the Canons.SIZE: The smallest superzoom anywhere.  Smaller than Canon's superzoom the SX-1000.  Looks better too.LOOKS AND FEEL: I absolutely loved the looks and feel of this camera.  It reminded me of my old SLR.  It had a nice heft to it, and the controls were laid out nicely.  Also love the fact that it was black and made of good quality materials.BATTERY: Battery life is very good.  Took almost 200 shots and did not even come close to using up the battery.FLASH: Flash is very strong for a camera this size.  Reaches rather far, but will not illuminate an object at the end of the 10X zoom.CONS:PROCESSOR: This camera is a grand slam waiting to happen if they can just put in a better processor.  On indoor pictures, there is no ability to take a good candid with the camera because it hunts for focus and zoom for too long.  Many of the pictures that were taken exhibited astounding amounts of fringing, or were out of focus.  Because I was looking for a camera that I needed to take many indoor candid shots (where people are moving around and not posing), this was a deal breaker for me.On outside shots, where you have plenty of light and if people don't move around too much, the camera takes excellent pictures.  Many of the professional reviewers lament Panasonic's heavy handed noise reduction, but you don't see anything on the outside shots.  This zoom range is an unbelievable asset to have outdoors.Overall, many reviewers labelled this a ""travel camera"" and it is easy to see why.  It is durable, has a great lens, and will take excellent sightseeing photos.  For that purpose, it is highly recommended.  I knocked it down to three stars because I need a camera that does it all very well, and the indoor performance of this camera was disappointing in view of how much I really wanted to like and keep this camera.Hope this helps and best of luck in your shopping!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GUMZXG7962A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011Z6D86#wasThisHelpful","R12GUMZXG7962A","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not quite as fast as the SD 800 IS, but faster than almost any other point and shoot digital camera you will find.  Considerably faster than the Panasonic.PROCESSOR: Excellent super sharp photos in a wide variety of conditions.LENS:  This is a very nice range lens with excellent edge to edge sharpness that performs very well in a variety of conditions.SIZE: very small, fits anywhere.  Marginally smaller than the SD 800 IS, which itself is a small camera.  The SD 800 IS and the SD 850 IS take different batteries because the SD 850 IS is marginally smaller.  Extremely pocketable.VIEWFINDER OPTIONS: Optical viewfinder, the screen is so good that you don't use this that often, but it is nice to know it is there for those really really sunny days (and they come up every so often).BATTERY: Battery life is exceptional.  Camera seems to go on for months with one battery (I think it is rated for 400+ shots, which is an astounding battery life for such a small camera).CONTROLS: I would say of the three cameras, this one had the best layout of controls.  The half hidden wheel on the back is an excellent design touch and the on/off button, while not where you would expect it to be, prevents accidental on/off switching.  A very well laid out camera from the ergonomic standpoint.  Also, the four way control pad has an external touch sensitive ring which is pretty cool (when it works well) but Canon maintains its highly regarded and often imitated control layout on this little gem.NEUTRAL:APPEARANCE: The looks of the camera.  I prefer black cameras as I used to own a film SLR and black cameras remind me of that beloved camera.  However, my wife seems to like the looks of this camera.CONS:LIMITED ZOOM: Would like a drop more zoom range, perhaps a 5x - 6x would be preferable.  The replacement model for this (890) has a 5x zoom, but from initial reviews, the 890's performance is not quite as good as that of this camera.FLASH: Flash is a little weak, but this is par for the course on a point and shoot.OPTICAL VIEWFINDER: Optical viewfinder is really small, is off center and not useful for every time composure on this camera, the camera is made to be used with the LCD on.Can't go wrong with either this or the SD 800IS, as they are essentially the same camera with different lenses, it just depends on whether you want a wide angle lens or not.Good luck with your shopping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/RALWY1XIGSNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q30420#wasThisHelpful","RALWY1XIGSNY","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have had this camera for about 8 months now, and have taken over 1000 pictures.  It is an excellent camera in all respects.  While you read it over and over, the 28 mm wide angle lens really makes a difference.Recently, there have been some promotions at a big box store with some other cameras, so I decided to do a little test comparing the SD 800 IS (28mm to 105 mm), SD 850 IS (35mm to 140 mm) and the Panasonic Lumix TZ4 (28mm to 280 mm).  I just wanted to make sure that I had the camera that was right for me.As part of the test, I took about 70 photos with each camera in various lighting conditions, indoor lighting behind, indoor lighting in front, outdoor, zoom, wide angle, etc.  Because I usually use only 4x6 prints, I printed all the photos in 4x6 prints at a local photo lab.

As fast a digital camera as you will find.  Noticeably faster than the SD 850IS, but they are close.PROCESSOR: Excellent photos in a wide variety of conditions.LENS: Wide angle lens is a real treat in a point and shoot.  I shot 22 kids all on one staircase and all of them fit in the picture, and I did not have to walk back any steps (or wedge myself into a corner, etc. to do it).  Also, outside, and especially outside, it is amazing what you will fit into a picture.  At 4 x 6 did not notice any distortion, but as another review noted, I don't really look at the corners of a picture, so this is not really an issue.SIZE: very small, fits anywhere.VIEWFINDER OPTIONS: Optical viewfinder, the screen is so good that you don't use this that often, but it is nice to know it is there for those really really sunny days (and they come up every so often).BATTERY: Battery life is exceptional.

"I've read the reviews both good and bad on this sharpener and for the life of me could not reconcile the two.  So, based on the majority of the reviews being good, I bought it here from Amazon.The end result, the sharpener is quite good, but the manual is somewhat misleading and if you follow the instructions in the manual exactly, it will not produce the results that you want.  I read and re-read the manual before sharpening, did a practice test run before putting the knives through, so imagine my surprise when my Henckels Four Stars were not sharpening.  However, when I passed a crummy little dinged up OXO knife through, it was sharpened as if it were brand new.  So apparently, the sharpener was doing something, but I couldn't figure out how to get the OXO results on the Henckels knives.Then I referred back to that wonderful Cook's Illustrated review which gave this sharpener a Highly Recommended rating.  For those of you who don't know, Cooks Illustrated does not accept advertising and generally has pretty objective reviews of the products it tests.  Cooks Illustrated said they passed their knives through 15 times before they became sharp.  So that's what I did.  15 times, each knife.  And then I sharpened them on a separate sharpening steel, per the instructions of Alton Brown (of Food Network fame).The result, exceptionally sharp knives.  Exceptionally.  This product, when used in that manner, will produce very very sharp knives.  Also, with what a professional knife sharpener charges, if you have several knives, like we do, after a few uses, this sharpener will pay for itself.Why four stars then?  The confusion caused by the unclear manual was somewhat frustrating.  For this kind of money, this model should have a sharpening steel on it in addition to the motorized stage 2 sharpening wheel.  Not perfect, but works very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWR1STJQZP1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GZKYO#wasThisHelpful","RYWR1STJQZP1L","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After buying a small above ground pool with a fairly weak filter system, I found out that there are very few low cost options for cleaning the pool.  This vacuum is one of them.This vacuum works by having water literally shove the dirt off of the pool floor into the vacuum's brushes and into the filter bag.  The filter bag is durable and the system generally works well.  The vacuum is less effective at picking up the fine dust that seems to accumulate on the bottom of the pool.The vacuum is remarkably effective at getting large dirt particles off the bottom of the pool floor and is rather easy to use.  The ""additional equipment"" referenced in another review is a standard pool extension handle that can be found at any hardware or pool supply store during the summer.PROS -CheapWorks wellPicks stuff off of bottom of pool that otherwise couldn't get toOther options do not seem to be more effectiveCONS -Need additional handle with additional costDoesn't get the really small stuffGood luck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BD61PS0J4A3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007PZN7S#wasThisHelpful","R3BD61PS0J4A3D","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this drive because it was on sale from Circuit City and was very reasonably priced for the storage size (4GB).  It is my first thumb drive.  It is extremely compact and very very light.  The build quality seems decent, but not extraordinary.  The thumb slider works well, and it is nice not to have to worry about losing a cap for the USB drive.One thing to keep in mind is that this is not the fastest drive in the world.  It took a good while to transfer 2GB of files onto the drive.  While this is not an issue for my purposes, you might want to keep this in mind if you are intending to use the drive to transfer large amounts of data back and forth.  For me, I just want a back up of many files and be able to pull them off the drive when I need to and the drive works very well for that.The price storage ratio really can't be beat - 4GB - which would have cost a king's ransom before, is now rather affordable with this drive.In operation, the drive was very easy to use.  Just plug it in and it works.  Drive packaging says Vista compatible, and it comes from Kingston which makes a generally good product.If you just need a reasonably priced drive to store files and be very light so that you don't notice it, then this is the drive for you.------------------------------As an update to this review, I've now used the drive on several different computers and it has worked flawlessly on each. It is also much much faster than it was the first time I used it. This leads me to believe that the problem was with the network from which I was copying files and had nothing to do with this drive. Thus, I would probably increase my review to 4 1/2 stars, with a 5 stars to be given if it had a metal casing. The plastic casings on all of these drives seems a little flimsy. Otherwise, an excellent drive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NYJ0AA6D964/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TXEE0U#wasThisHelpful","R10NYJ0AA6D964","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both our regular and back up Canon batteries died, they were so bad, they got to the point that they only could hold a charge for about 2 shots between them.We bought two of these Lenmars for less than the price of a single OEM Canon battery.  So far, I've had the batteries about a month, they charged right up in the Canon charger that came with my S230, and they are working fine.  I've not had to recharge them since I initially charged them when bought them, but I haven't taken that many pictures (less than 100).  Nevertheless, they are working great.  I also believe that their capacity is higher than an OEM Canon (1000 mah Lenmar vs. 850mah for the Canon).I've had bad experiences with other generic batteries, but these seem to be a good balance of price and performance.

"This watch is more impressive in person than in pictures.The look is more timeless and classic than those watches with the traditional Movado look (the look is reminiscent of, although -- for obvious reasons -- not exactly identical to, certain Bulgari watches).  However, the price and quality are still Movado, which means you get a rather fine quality watch for not too much money (particularly at Amazon's discounted price).Amazon's service was, as has been my experience, consistently excellent.  I received the watch rather quickly, and it came nicely packed with all the original boxes and paperwork.  In my opinion, if you want a nice watch in this price range, you really can't go wrong.Good luck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WENCJ2YT260M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007RTBZG#wasThisHelpful","R2WENCJ2YT260M","A3V2P1ZV2LETF3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V2P1ZV2LETF3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Scherzos are played with a pristine turbulence that VERY few can even begin to match.  Such violent drama juxtaposed with extreme tenderness flows from Pollini's hands with tremendous emotive effect.  His renditions of the Scherzos are powerful, gentle, overflowing with warmth uncharacteristic of his ""usual"" playing.  They stand as a benchmark of perfection by which others will be measured.The Berceuse is everything it should be - a lullaby.  Pollini manages to fuse intensely powerful emotion with a lace-like delicatissimo, leaving this listener breathless. His virtuosity is apparent but never overpowers the candenza-esque passages.He certainly can play in a Lisztian style, but does not impose his raw power where extreme tenderness is requisite.I absolutely adore this album.Hoping you find this review helpful, as always, thanks for reading.Peter","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q32TIRCO728/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V6OLEE#wasThisHelpful","R2Q32TIRCO728","A1G9TMHLF95O89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G9TMHLF95O89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(Dermatologist) said a simple word: Scalpicin.  What? I inquired. ""Hydrocortisone, topical"" she said.After a major facepalm, I realized the folly of my previous attempts to merely control the 'scaly scalp' I'd suffered since puberty.The ""root"" of the problem was inflammation. Cure the inflammation and you've cured the scalp-scale! (Hindsight is 20-20, but I still say to myself DEUGHHHHHHH!!!!!""So, I go to my local CVS and purchase a bottle of Scalpicin Max. Strength.  I was forewarned not to apply it to a large area of my head, due to risk of side effects. After a week, my 'dandruff' was gone. AND MAJOR BONUS!!!!  All the areas of prematurely thinning hair, filled in beautifully. The very texture of my hair went from brittle and dry to supple and thick.  The transition took about 6 weeks.I'm a different man because of this product. My hair is growing in darker and thicker.Note: Due to risky side effects, I only use Scalpicin every 5 days. The cortisone in it can enter your bloodstream and cause side-effects in line with oral prednisone...not a good thing!

"UPDATE  June 2015:  I still love this brush, a caveat:  Change the brush head much more often than you'd think - every 2 months - it works SOOOOO much better with a new brush!!!  Also, swig about a teaspoon of 3% H2O2 (peroxide) with your toothpaste for a ridiculous clean!This toothbrush is amazing!  I'll just say this:With a manual brush, I notice a film of plaque reforming after 12 hours or so.  I thought this was normal.Well, imagine my surprise when after using the Sonicare, my teeth remained squeaky clean for 3 DAYS!  Yes, I experimented to see how long I could go without accumulating plaque. This device cleans the mouth SO thoroughly, it's scary; the junk I spat out after the first use was truly frightening!  All that bacteria that had been damaging my smile were dislodged with stunning completeness! The Sonicare literally vibrates the plaque out from under the gum-line!I sincerely wish you try this item for yourself.  You will not be disappointed!BTW, in the case of travelling overseas - when fully charged, you'll get about 20 uses on a single charge...enough for a 10 day trip.A note about the design: I advise simply unscrewing the brush-head after every few uses and cleaning it with peroxide or just plain H2O.  This will keep any gunk from accumulating inside the apparatus. It takes about 20 seconds to clean it, so it no big deal, IMO.This model is economically priced and functions flawlessly to give you a clean you thought only a trip to the dentist could give.If you find my review helpful, please give it an up-vote; I really appreciate your feedback!Thanks,Peter","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96EMK5KXFQMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZN5ATQ#wasThisHelpful","R96EMK5KXFQMK","A1G9TMHLF95O89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G9TMHLF95O89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Please read the addendum at the bottom, you may find it helpful:)Sensus is/was a Foamex product. (I'd done quite a bit of research and (through some prying phone conversations with Foamex) found out that they once supplied Tempurpedic.) They are THE memory-foam authority. (Let that sink in for a minute.) If Tempurpedic chose this company to make their products, it must be top-quality.I own this particular topper and I can say it is everything you want a memory-foam product to be; resilient, durable, firm, supportive, responsive and COMFORTABLE! I promise, you won't be disappointed with it.I've also done the math and figured out the actual density. My Sensus topper has a density of 5.3 pounds per cubic foot; the exact density of the Tempurpedic topper. So there's no skimping on density, here.  I reiterate, the up-front price is tiny compared to the long-term value. Expect 5 years of flawless performance from this dense foam. You may even get ~10 years out of it, depending on use.Some generic info about memory foam:There's a few things you MUST consider, it's long but I think you will find this helpful.#1 Density. Density refers to the weight of the foam given a certain volume. It is measured in pounds per cubic foot or lb/ft3. As a rule, the higher the density, the firmer and more resilient (durable) the foam. There are exceptions to this rule, but that's for later. Generally speaking, a density of less than 3lb/ft3 is extremely soft, very low resiliency; it's bottom of the barrel stuff and should be bought as a super light-duty item (for your toy poodle's bed.) Foam with a density between 3lb/ft3 and 3.9lb/ft3 is marginal; expect it to be very soft and to wear out after a scant year of regular use. Densities of 4lb/ft3 - 5.3lb/ft3, you're into the better range; expect this foam to be soft to medium firmness and to last for 2 years of regular use (at the high end of the range, up to 5 years). Memory foam with a rating of over 5.3lb/ft3 is where the quality products are found; these products can best be described as medium-firm to firm and should last 5 years or more (you pay for what you get.) There's even an 8lb/ft3 foam on the market!(Good for the supportive middle layers of mattresses.) Some important notes: If you are a back-sleeper, I suggest a minimum of 5lb/ft3 memory foam; this will prevent sagging. Side-sleepers can get away with a softer density (4.5lb/ft3 is about the lowest I suggest for anybody.)The firmness of memory foam varies greatly with temperature; a foam that is firm at 65 degrees can be squishy at 85; also, there are differences in manufacturing procedures that can produce very different firmnesses in different products of the same density. If you want to delve further, you'll have to go looking for yourself; the details are far too complicated for this post. lol#2 Thickness. After you've chosen the density that suits you, consider the thickness. I'll keep this short; if you sleep on your back, go for about 2"" and if you sleep on your side, go for 3"". DON'T GET SOMETHING TOO THICK!!!, you'll just get a hammock effect. (Higher density foams will be more supportive at any given thickness, so if there's a choice between thick and light or thin and dense, go with the latter.)#3 The Underlying Structure. If your old mattress is uncomfortable, putting a topper on it will not improve the situation by much. Memory foam is made so that it takes the shape of whatever is underneath it. If you need a new mattress, buy one. Expensive band-aids are just that...band-aids. Here's a BIG hint: Use a 6"" thick slab of traditional polyurethane foam as the base for your topper; this will be a smooth, firm base. Remember this is NOT memory foam, it's a dense version of what's in your sofa cushions. Using a density of over 2.5lb/ft3 is vital for a base layer. If you need a new mattress get this as your base. Here, I can't mention a particular website, but there are manufacturers that make this stuff: (you know how to Google it)* DENSITY: 2.8lb/ft3* COMPRESSION: 35 LBS (the higher the number, the firmer)* Medium Firm* EXTREMELY RESILIENTThere are multiple options for the base layer(s). A foam with a compression of about 24-35lbs is likely a good base layer. Outside that range could be too soft or too firm.#4 Cost. Many make the mistake of confusing the price of a particular item with its cost. Considering that very high-density (5.3lb/ft3 and up) polyurethane memory foam (all memory foam is made from polyurethane but not all polyurethane foam is memory foam) can easily last twenty times as long or longer than a low density foam, I don't need to explain how the ""expensive"" high-density products are anything but.#5 The Break-In Period. Memory foam products will be their firmest when brand-new. After a break-in period of a few weeks, the foam softens significantly. So, when you first lie down on new memory foam, if it feels soft, you're in trouble; for after the break-in period, it will be much too soft. A memory foam product should be almost uncomfortably firm right out the box; give it time; after a few weeks, it gradually soften to the perfect firmness. If it's soft right out the package, SEND IT BACK!I hope this was informative and please rate this review as helpful so it may see the light of day!Please read also the addendum at the bottom of this review.  You will find it useful!This is a fine product.There's a few things you MUST consider, I hope this helps you:#1 Density. Density refers to the weight of the foam given a certain volume. It is measured in pounds per cubic foot or lb/ft3. As a rule, the higher the density, the firmer and more resilient (durable) the foam. There are exceptions to this rule, but that's for later. Generally speaking, a density of less than 3lb/ft3 is extremely soft, very low resiliency; it's bottom of the barrel stuff and should be bought as a super light-duty item (for your toy poodle's bed.) Foam with a density between 3lb/ft3 and 3.9lb/ft3 is marginal; expect it to be very soft and to wear out after a scant year of regular use. Densities of 4lb/ft3 - 5.3lb/ft3, you're into the better range; expect this foam to be soft to medium firmness and to last for 2 years of regular use (at the high end of the range, up to 5 years). Memory foam with a rating of over 5.3lb/ft3 is where the quality products are found; these products can best be described as medium-firm to firm and should last 5 years or more (you pay for what you get.) There's even an 8lb/ft3 foam on the market!(Good for the supportive middle layers of mattresses.) Some important notes: If you are a back-sleeper, I suggest a minimum of 5lb/ft3 memory foam; this will prevent sagging. Side-sleepers can get away with a softer density (4lb/ft3 is about the lowest I suggest for anybody.)The firmness of memory foam varies greatly with temperature; a foam that is firm at 65 degrees can be squishy at 85; also, there are differences in manufacturing procedures that can produce very different firmnesses in different products of the same density. If you want to delve further, you'll have to go looking for yourself; the details are far too complicated for this post. lol#2 Thickness. After you've chosen the density that suits you, consider the thickness. I'll keep this short; if you sleep on your back, go for about 2"" and if you sleep on your side, go for 3"". Don't get something too thick, you'll just get a hammock effect. (Higher density foams will be more supportive at any given thickness, so if there's a choice between thick and light or thin and dense, go with the latter.)#3 The Underlying Structure. If your old mattress is uncomfortable, putting a topper on it will not improve the situation by much. Memory foam is made so that it takes the shape of whatever is underneath it. If you need a new mattress, buy one. Expensive band-aids are just that...band-aids. Here's a BIG hint: Use a 6"" thick slab of traditional polyurethane foam as the base for your topper; this will be a smooth, firm base. Remember this is NOT memory foam, it's a dense version of what's in your sofa cushions. Using a density of over 2.5lb/ft3 is vital for a base layer. If you need a new mattress get this as your base. Here, I can't mention a particular website, but there are manufacturers that make this stuff: (you know how to Google it)* DENSITY: 2.8lb/ft3* COMPRESSION: 35 LBS (the higher the number, the firmer)* Medium Firm* EXTREMELY RESILIENTThere are multiple options for the base layer(s). A foam with a compression of about 24-35lbs is likely a good base layer. Outside that range could be too soft or too firm.#4 Cost. Many make the mistake of confusing the price of a particular item with its cost. Considering that very high-density (5.3lb/ft3 and up) polyurethane memory foam (all memory foam is made from polyurethane but not all polyurethane foam is memory foam) can easily last twenty times as long or longer than a low density foam, I don't need to explain how the ""expensive"" high-density products are anything but.#5 The Break-In Period. Memory foam products will be their firmest when brand-new. After a break-in period of a few weeks, the foam softens significantly. So, when you first lie down on new memory foam, if it feels soft, you're in trouble; for after the break-in period, it will be much too soft. A memory foam product should be almost uncomfortably firm right out the box; give it time; after a few weeks, it gradually soften to the perfect firmness. If it's soft right out the package, SEND IT BACK!I hope this was informative and please rate this review as helpful so it may see the light of day!------------------------------ADDENDUM---------------------To bring you all up to speed: I have a DIY memory foam mattress. FYI, it cost a total of $550 In 2008 (I imagine you could you could do it for <$900 in 2015Here's some back-story: I sleep on a DIY memory foam/non-memory poly foam bed (after many months of trial and expensive error, I found the holy grail of mattresses.) This what I sleep on (Tempurpedic, eat your heart out!)I Layered, from bottom to top:1: On a newly cleaned floor or low-profile platform bed: A 6"" base layer of extremely firm poly foam (with an ILD of 50) it functions as the box spring.  It is like new (the ILD 50 base foam) after nearly 9 years of my sleeping on it EVERY night. The manufacturer claims a lifetime of 25+ years!  After 9 years, It is virtually brand new.2: Immediately place a 2"" layer of Sensus 5.3 lb/ft3 directly on the VERY firm base. Trust me, it serves a VERY important function in that place. Through trial and error, I realized that having a soft, mem-foam layer adjacent to an exceptionally firm layer has advantages - namely, avoiding getting ""stuck"" in the memory foam layer on the top most layer, which would happen if I put all the memory foam on the top layers. By placing 2"" of Sensus in the lower middle of the 'foam stack', it adds some of the springiness of an innerspring mattress without the pressure points of springs.  Doing so also allows there to be deformation of the firm base layer while avoiding pressure points. (The more you compress memory foam, the firmer it gets, SO it provides an excellent transition between the base layer and the upper layers.3. ***Then add a 6"" thick middle layer of poly foam with an ILD of 30-35.  This will provide you a transition between the firm base layer and the now compressed 2"" sensus layer, which will function as a pleasantly flexible, yet supportive box-spring and a transition between the base layer and the comfort layers.***Get a cheap piece of poly foam, you want any wear to be taken by the cheaper foam.  That layer is only about $36 and should last for 2-5 years.***4) Top that with an upside-down eggshell foam layer, for ventilation. (with an ILD of 28-35)4. Next to last, top your creation with 2 inches of Sensus 5.3lb/ft3 memory foam.5. Finally, get a good cover for your mattress (dust finds a way into the darndest places!)I have a nice thick pillowtop that is sooooo soft and evens out the overall feel of the matress.8 years in and I notice only the MOST subtle wear on my Sensus, 5.3 lb, topper.BUT GOOD NEWS!!! All i need to do was turn it 180 degrees and flip it over. It's a as good as it was after the 4 week break in period. At this rate, my 5.3lb memory foam layers (2"" and 2"") will last at LEAST 12 years, maybe more, as I haven't notice any failures in the foam.Here's trick I found useful. In between my Sensus Memory Fm. layers, I place a poly foam, 6 inches thick with an ILD of 35 (medium firm). It prevents me from sinking through 4"" of memory foam, provides a very gentle softness, via allowing the 5"" poly foam to ever so slightly give into the underlying 2"" Sensus.  It also preserves the lower Sensus layers from frictional wear as well as oxidation. Every 3 years, I turn the whole ""foam sandwich"" upside down and backwards, to even out the wear and tear, little as it may be!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5J21RUTW3GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I4RDCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1E5J21RUTW3GQ","A1G9TMHLF95O89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G9TMHLF95O89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those rare recordings that capture a pianist at his technical and artistic peak.Garrick Ohlsson's rendition of the Etudes is nothing short of miraculous.  If Chopin were alive to hear this he would cry out in religious ecstacy! I imagine Chopin saying, ""I can now rest knowing my work has finally been given justice!"" One can only hope he hears from beyond the grave. Ohlsson succesfully combines the often exclusive elements of lightness of touch combined with extreme speed, accuracy and exceptional artistry without pathos.This performance will expand your intellect and satisfy your soul.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHE7HSJ9VLBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DCQR#wasThisHelpful","R3VHE7HSJ9VLBM","A1G9TMHLF95O89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G9TMHLF95O89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We will never hear Chopin's own critique of this performance, but I would imagine he would be just as stunned by Pollini's titanic virtuosity as I was the first time I heard this recording.  Chopin dedicated his opus 10 (etudes 1-12) to none other than Franz Liszt.  I mention this because Pollini plays this opus as though it was written by Liszt. Did Chopin intend opus 10 nos. 1-12 to be played in this Lisztian style?  I would argue yes for the simple reason that this is a set of ETUDES, therefore the use of a mammoth technique is not out of place.  Pollini's performance is captivating in it's accuray and power, as well as it's beauty (listen to opus 10 No.3).  I remember the first time I heard this album.  I was 15 years old, sitting in my parents' minivan in the parking lot of the store at which I had just bought the CD. From the first BOOM of etude op10 No.1 to the last thunderous chord of op25 No.12 I sat transfixed, almost dazed by what I was hearing.  It was a life altering experience for me.  I was a mediocre piano student not too serious about my piano study. Hearing Pollini made me realize the possibilties of the piano and triggered an absolute resolve to master the instrument.  Ten years later, I have mastered all of op.10 and some of opus 25.  The reason I mention my background is I feel that I may offer some insight into what technical problems the pianist faces when tackling Chopin's etudes.Opus 10 No.1 is comprised entirely of r.h. arpeggios with a chorale accompaniment.  On the surface it doesn't sound extraordinarily difficult, but when we delve deeper we find the arpeggios are super wide with intervals of as much as a sixth between thumb and index finger and a fourth between the 4th and 5th fingers! At a tempo of 176! It's insane!!!Opus 10 No.2 also doesn't sound particularly demanding until one realizes that the chromatic scales in the r.h. are played with mostly the 4th and 5th fingers! Try playing a chromatic scale in this way and you will instantly understand the difficulty.Opus 10 No.3 is, by Chopin's own words, I paraphrase, ""In all my life I have never heard a more beautiful melody.""  Apart from the tumultuous middle section and all of its chromatic tri-tones, thepiece is easy to play but maddeningly hard to play WELL.Opus 10 No.4 sounds very demanding but is actually one of the easier etudes!  There is lots of chromatic passagework along with quickly modulating descending diminished seventh chords. Proper phrasing and rhythmic control are the keys to mastering this etude.Opus 10 No.5 is arguably the easiest etude.  Its l.h. staccato chords are enveloped by a twirling r.h. accompaniment composed entirely of black keys.  Proper r.h. arm rotation makes this etude totally effortless.(I'll finish my analysis later.)p.s. Garrick Ohlson's recording of the etudes is every bit as good, if not better, than Pollini's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YG3TYBY6V04X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001G5H#wasThisHelpful","R2YG3TYBY6V04X","A1G9TMHLF95O89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G9TMHLF95O89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most reviews are about the mini version. My review is about the very large white TP-740... and it is very large... a full size projector. There is nothing mini about the TP-740. It seems to be a good projector with a nice bright image. I have only used it twice and so far I like it except for the size. It is not heavy but it is big. Speakers are clear and can be very loud. Focus is easy and works well for a nice sharp image with accurate color. Even on a tan, textured, slanted ceiling, the image is very good... On a screen, it is quite amazing for 100 watts. In a dark room, projected on a screen, the image is as good as an LCD, except with small text, but fine for closed caption wording. In a dimly lit room, the image is viewable for movies, youtube, etc. It needs nearly complete darkness for reading small text like email... on a screen and then it is not very good. It has lots of inputs, and an excellent remote. It does not have a center adjustment leg for height or angle, nor does it have a tripod mount. It has a thick power cord. The fan is quite loud, but not as loud as a DLP bulb projector. The unit gets warm, but not hot. I will update this review if I have problems with it. So far, so good and worth the $$.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IS5JMGBHHBK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFA6WUM#wasThisHelpful","R1IS5JMGBHHBK1","A2SKEQT0WTB954","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKEQT0WTB954?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I have only used the projector for a few days, I can honestly say that it is a great deal. I am writing this review with a 6 ft. diagonal image projected on my slanted tan textured ceiling and even though the room is bright enough to read a book, I can see the image and the words fine. It is much better when the room is dark, of course, but I did not expect to see anything in a medium bright room at this price point.Within 5 minutes of opening the box, I had it attached by hdmi cable to my computer and was watching Netflix.Compared to the $1,000 name brand projector I had a few years ago it is half as good in terms of picture quality in a bright room, but about the same in a fully dark room. The fan does produce noise but not as much as the high lumens high end projector that I once had. The sound quality and volume is better. Colors are accurate, but the image is sharp only in the center and less so towards each sides. Great adjustments for sharpness, colors, volume, etc. Good remote for all adjustments. Surprisingly, lots of volume from such a small device. Of course, the lumens are no where near what is claimed, probably more like 50 or 60. Considering everything, this is a fantastic projector for the money. It is not a business projector, since fine detail at the edges would be unacceptable.UPDATE: Unfortunately, I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars since the LED unit burned out or became disconnected with 3rd use of the projector. I may have gotten a lemon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BJVU0BIKBNOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3146BO#wasThisHelpful","R1BJVU0BIKBNOB","A2SKEQT0WTB954","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKEQT0WTB954?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have gone through a dozen man bags at various price points trying to find something I really like. I have found it in this one. It is the least expensive and the best in terms of my needs. Strap can be adjusted for someone from 5' to 7' so plenty of adjustibility. The adjustment buckle could be a bit tighter but is easily remedied with any number of stop items like a tiny safety pin, a few stitches of thread, etc. It holds a great deal and it is convenient with the pockets.

"Been suffering from migraines for 12 years and doctors have offered me no hope. Never could find a reason and I know it was from muscles and alignment or something like that out of alignment. I sprayed on my neck in a 20% solution flakes to 80% water in a spray bottle and carried it around. Whenever I felt tension in my neck I sprayed it on and that tension just melted away. That's all I was after but low and behold I stopped getting my migraines after one month of use! That's one hell of a side effect. Unlike the side effects my docs prescribed which could be death! lol So glad I accidentally discovered this cure! Migraine free for 3 1/2 years now and I used to get them 3 times a week on average for over 12 years!! I read magnesium can only be absorbed readily by our largest organ...... our Skin! I will attest that it burned the first couple of times for an hour or so like a mild sunburn. I can only conclude that is due to the fact that I was so deficient my skin was sucking all the mag oil out at sonic speed. lol This is the only pure source on the planet as it stands now. Come from uncontaminated mines 250,000,000 million years old. No pollution!

"I'm sorry- no offense meant to the writer- but seriously?!?!?!SERIOUSLY!?!?!??!?!I hate leaving negative reviews. Much of the time I'll skip reviewing just because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Not this time.This book lacks character development and the protagonist (who has zero development- in fact I'd say she has negative character development as far as I am concerned- if that is even possible!) is nothing. This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience. She's trying to figure out who she wants to sleep with with literally no regard beyond a ""I wonder if my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend were eaten"" (not a quote, more of a paraphrase).This story has (as mentioned before), no character development. The plot was completely disorganized and stupid.If you are looking for a Pulitzer prize winner- Don't bother.If you are looking for a great adventure/fantasy book- Don't bother.If you are looking for a decent romance book- Don't bother.If you are looking for some mindless drivel to keep you preoccupied- Don't bother.SERIOUSLY- pass on this one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33O50739CVZAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ELAP9C#wasThisHelpful","R33O50739CVZAQ","A3JF001WP479T7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JF001WP479T7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am new to the Eternal Series and Candy Crum books, but I am really enjoying this. There are certain things that bothered me- the lack of proof reading for one. There were some typos.

"Another reviewer brought up the amount of sex in this book. I agree. Rather than focus on the plot there was an overabundance of sex scenes. Don't get me wrong- I'm not a prude. However when it seems to be filler it's too much. The author should have worked on plot and character development. When it gets to the point that there are about 5 sex scenes in 20 pages the effect the author wanted for those scenes fall short. I am a die hard P & P fan- and I liked this book more than most, but the gratuitous sex honestly ruined a lot of the book for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0UEJS5XWG7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EU50XS#wasThisHelpful","R2E0UEJS5XWG7X","A3JF001WP479T7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JF001WP479T7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this months ago and forgot reviewing it. Anyway, it's definitely showing its age on Windows Phone 10, but it was already sort of sluggish on WP8. This seems like the type of device you buy for your kids because you don't want to destroying your main device. However, I got a SIM unlock code from ATT after submitting the info to them, so I suppose it will be an okay backup phone for T-Mobile now.I played around with WP10 previews and I can't say I'm a fan of the OS or lag. Don't get me wrong, I love 8.1+7, and have even purchased Windows tablets in the past. For some reason I cannot get into the WP ecosystem - it's just not as robust as Android or iOS.While the device is ridiculously slow, at least I can say standby battery is awesome with battery-saver.

"Currently using this with my Moto.Design/control: +1These are only my 2nd pair of BT headphones/earphones (LG HBS-730 being my 1st foray into the medium), but I was delighted by the strange curling design. Basically, once you remove them they'll fold back up, which might become a little annoying later on. When you power-on the headset you get a voice to notify you, though it also has a voice for when a device pairs with it. Whenever I pair it with my phone it takes only a few seconds, maybe 3 at most.Comfort: -0.5I've tried many different headphones/earphones over the years and these honestly aren't that comfortable; luckily these only hurt my right ear if worn for extended periods, so it's sort of tolerable in a way. Also I tried different ear tips, yet the problem persists.Sound: +1Considering the price these are pretty decent for being under $30. I'd say sound quality is 3.5/5. At times songs can sound ""muddier"" than with similarly priced wired earphones, so if you're picky about clarity just keep that in mind. Bass is present, but again, not comparable to pricey wired or ""premium"" bluetooth headphones, still good though and better than my 730's at least. (Not sure how important apt-x + BT v4.1 are to quality)Battery: -0.5Feeling unsure about this aspect. I haven't seen a green LED for when battery is full even after charging it for over 3hrs, so I honestly can't tell where the battery level is. I'll just charge it every other day I suppose.Volume: +1These can get pretty loud if you max the volume on the headset and on the paired device. I think the Cheetah has 5-steps, and I haven't heard distortion yet. Sometimes when the audio is too high (or the bass is too deep?) the headphones will perform poorly.Price: +1Most headphones I buy are usually in this price range (i.e. Brain Wavz or Earpods), so when I evaluate these I consider how others have performed on the same song(s).Range: +1Range seems to be reliable. I had a few solid walls between me and my phone yet the connection didn't break. Typically too many walls, distance, and perhaps wireless interference would cause my 730's to drop audio, or disconnect fully.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BJ3H7TM227R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013U54BFG#wasThisHelpful","R14BJ3H7TM227R","AX1PJ7BKPDODC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX1PJ7BKPDODC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely write reviews with 1 star, but this is unbelievable. I purchased this about 10 days ago and it lost the ability to charge properly about 2 days ago. If you mess, bend, or just play with the cable you might get a charge for a few seconds.This sucks because I liked the charger at first, then I noticed my phone didn't show the little charging animation. After that I put my Encore Mini to it...same thing, stopped charging. Now I have tried other chargers like the one from my Lumia 521, which works, just slowly.Sadly this Aukey will be my first and last purchase from the company, buyer beware.Edit: I added another star because the wall piece is still functioning with other cables, still disappointed that the USB part refuses to charge my devices.

"Honestly, I'm finding the performance to be poor at times. I mean I have failed a few QTE's despite pressing the correct button. When I played TWAU on Vita my experience was the same, so if you're someone that's bothered by this sort of thing I highly suggest the PS4/PC version.That aside, I don't personally feel the cast of S2 isn't comparable to the first game's. They just don't feel as special to me at least.

"Initially I wasn't sure whether this game would be a good purchase because I've seen the anime once or twice. I sort of remembered the basic story there seem to be parts that are explained noticeably better in the games, and at some sections where you can ""interact"" can affect later events. For instance, I saved at one point then ignored a phone call from one of the characters, this led to me encountering something shortly after. However, when I reloaded that save and answered I got a very different scene. Essentially, my point is that you can experience Stein's story from different perspectives, so you definitely need to make use of the quick save/load feature (there's also normal save/load).Graphics:The artwork is very much eye candy, and being that this game is a VN you'll naturally will WANT to like this aspect. Characters have various gestures too.Sound:At first I thought the lack of English voices would alienate me (because I watched the anime in Engish) similar to Dragon Ball Z in JP, but I'm finding to JP cast to be excellent so far.Story:In basic terms Steins is about uncovering time travel, which is linked with a larger conspiracy. During the story you meet characters that might seem insignificant, yet later on their role in the story is magnified under different circumstances. I think this is a game where you need to experience the story for yourself while avoiding spoilers. Also I'd argue Steins handles time travel or multiple world theories better than other video games, such as VLR. There's an actual portion of the game where real scientific theories are discussed, while I'm not personally a physicist the details in the game seem accurate more-or-less. So while you're playing I guess you might learn a thing or two.Controls:You spend most of the time reading, occasionally reading tips (ex. definitions to special terms), responding to calls or reading mails. The game has two control layouts, as well as configurable text speed.I'll end by saying this title isn't for everyone, especially those looking for an interactive title. If you like Steins;Gate get it, if you like stories where the world or individuals face a major catastrophe get it. Just keep in mind the early chapters move really slowwww. It takes awhile to reach the interesting parts of the story, just a warning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Z08A89ILRWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ERY5IA#wasThisHelpful","R27Z08A89ILRWH","AX1PJ7BKPDODC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX1PJ7BKPDODC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is it, this is the ultimate JRPG, and perhaps the best game I've played since Metal Gear Rising! I can't believe I never played a Persona game prior to this, the gameplay is just so entertaining, and the music is just so fitting for the title. The only other game with such nice music is Metal Gear, but I digress.For those familiar with the series you'll notice P4G is significantly more bright, colorful, and ""happy"" than P3/FES. I played very little of P3, so I instantly noticed how the characters in this game were different overall. i found the character diversity to be quite good in this game, they definitely had me laughing at times, I was more interested here than when I played FFVII. Although I found Disgaea 3 for Vita to be similarly funny and equally ridiculous too.Now onto gameplay mechanics. P4G seems to possess the same ""turn-based"" system of P4 for PS2, however I noticed you can select attacks for each party member(max of 4). I do like that you can control AI partners, I dislike games where you have these mindless things doing the fighting for you. I found each character to play differently, except some are definitely less useful compared to others for certain bosses. Just like Pokemon, Persona cards & enemies have elemental weaknesses. I find that this adds a layer of difficulty, especially since YOU also have to prepare the right personas for certain bosses.Bosses in this game are interesting, and there are secret bosses you can fight after meeting certain requirements. Keep in mind every boss doesn't fight the same, some can do special tricks that can screw your strategy up. You certainly cannot always repeat attacks or else you'll die often.Outside of actual battles(while in dungeon) you can open treasure chests for items. Please note after opening X amount of chests you may encounter a powerful Reaper thing. If you're under leveled you may lose to it, thankfully he makes a chain sound when he's near.While outside of dungeons you are able to do so many things(can't finish everything in one playthru) like build social links, work for money and to build skills, and shop for weapons/armors. The social link is a major, major part of this game. There is NOT enough time in 1 playthru to max ALL links, do not attempt this, you'll fail. Max only the ones you mainly want first, then do a new game+. At times the social building is kinda meh and drawn out like a bad movie, but the dialogue can keep you interested somewhat.Before I end I'll give my opinion of the story. I like stories with a lot of turns, drama, mysteries, etc so I naturally was pulled to this game near the start. I don't want to spoil much so I'll give a general overview. So you're a boy who moves to a small town with family, you eventually learn about the TV world and make friends along the way. People are attacked in odd ways that no one knows about, but the persona power allows you to investigate to a certain extent. I felt the story was emotional at one particular point, though you'll have to play it to know what I mean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R316PJX5WO8W1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W8S2MG#wasThisHelpful","R316PJX5WO8W1E","AX1PJ7BKPDODC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX1PJ7BKPDODC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was hopeful that this would be as good a back scratcher as most of the reviews seem to think it is.  My experience wasn't what I wished for in a back scratcher.The  first issue I have is with the claw tips  they are pointed but they are blunt and dull. ""Scratching""  with this is comparative to rubbing your back against a door way wall. It will apply pressure to the area more so than a scratching sensation.Second the telescoping isn't done very well. The longer it is the more it rotates around and you end up with the back side of the Bear claw to your back.  You can't see which way the paw has rotated of course when you attempt to scratch with it. I was disappointed that there was no lock to stop this from happeningMy cheap spaghetti fork, like you can get at the .99¢ stores scratches better than this. I will keep looking for a back scratcher.

I didn't plan to keep them so that was okay by me.What I found objectionable enough to say I hate this product is. They are about the size and shape of a Hot Dog casing, if you have ever made any hot dogs or sausages  you will know what I mean. If not  the are small little tubular pieces of nylon you have to pull open and stretch as you put your foot into it. This was a challenge for my grandmother.Secondly they don't cover your whole foot. Which makes them unless. My grandmother is a tiny woman and it only went to the middle of her arch. I am average height and they only went just past the ball of my foot.

I am glad she is happy.However, I am not as impressed with the set as she is, which is why I gave them 4 stars.In reading other reviews I noticed that others mentioned the blue &,green grip being thin. I didn't think they would be much thinner than the one that was wearing out after many years.The blue and green are very thin if you ever tried to open something with a paper towel I would say they are about the same.  She likes that she can feel more of the jar she is opening. I don't expect them to last very long. The red cone is not a grip we have had before.

"I really like this Langers Variety pack. The Apple and orange are both 100% juice concentrate. The oranges are sourced from the USA, Brazil, and  Mexico. I find this to be the standard for bottled Orange juice that is not refrigerated.The Cranberry juice cocktail is 75% Cranberry juice with purified water. Having had 100% cranberry juice in the past. I will say it is extremely tart and normally blended to make it palatable. At 75% Juice it has a pleasant tart flavor that isn't full of sugar. The Orange is not blended with grapefruit juice which is a plus, as some people on certain medications must avoid grapefruit. It also has a impressive 600mg of Potassium.The Apple juice is a good Apple juice with no added sugar to it.. it is neither to tart or too sweet.I would say it's only draw back is that it  doesn't have a subscribe and save option to this variety pack. , for those who  wish to buy it regularly.

"Very lightweight, soo lightweight I realized I accidently tossed mine in the trash. I was cleaning up the room and forgot I had the sleep mask in my hand. The next night I started looking for the mask and realized what I had done. So how's that for lightweight?For quality, weight and darkness, I give this mask five stars.I personally like the weight of a stuffed sleep mask but for review purposes, this is a great sleep mask. I think I like the tighter sleep mask because I naturally have very long eyelashes. Mask, sunglasses, etc.. crowd my eyelashes and it feels uncomforable. The 3D design keeps that from happening . I think the mask give you ""fly"" eyes. The curve of the mask looks as though you are have fly or bee eyes.Even though you may look like an insect, I feel these would look much better on a plane, train or bus, than traditional sleep mask.Very, very thin memory foam for comfort and adjustable band to fit your individual head size.Sleep mask provided for me to review.

I am not trying to Dj at the local club so the fact that bass and treble are in perfect sync is great. Everything I have listened to has been very clear.

Covered cushion has become standard with a lot of earphones but I remember when cheap foam was top of the line!*Each earphone can turn independently so you dont have to remove the entire set to let someone else listen.*The headphones fold down to a half their size and fit inside the carry case.

"Review braceletThe quality of the bracelet itself is great. It feels heavy, sturdy.I am not a fan of the ""rose gold"" color.

I have used plastic holders before however, the squeeze clasp had metal bars inside. Fifth photo shows the plastic inside piece.The silicone bands are decent but not awesome. The red silicone pieces are not attached and will fall out, so they will need to be glued. You can see them in the last photo.

"*Next day Edit - my husband in a goverment building that uses RFID for every door. He said the sleeves slowed down the time in which the door opened but did not stop him from gaining entry.For those like myself who are technology challenged, these are not for the standard debit/credit cards.Now with that being said, your card could have a RFID chip in it and you not even know it.

"This is truely an awesome Ultra lightweight backpack!What I love most is how you can fold it inside itself to make a little pouch. I am going to need practice to learn how and fold it into the pouch, no biggy though. It's not that it's hard, I'm just easily confused!Living in Montana, we hike a lot. One of the many National Forrest is literally feet away from our backyard. This pack is awesome for hiking. Every 4th of July we climb to the top of the mountain and watch fireworkworks over the city. This will be great for our snacks, blankets, water, etc...I am orginially from the east coast. A lot of the deep woods hiking there is full of ground brush. I am curious how a thin pack like this would hold up.As far as northwest hiking, I believe this is exactly what you want.Urban hiking? No problem.Great as an extra bag tucked away for Black Friday shopping.Those trips you go on and come back with more than you started with - here ya go, perfect bag.Make your kids carry their own darn toys - it's lightweight and perfect for that.Use as a gym bag! Lightweight diaper bag! Bike riding! Everything the heavy packs can do, without the weight.When I say books, I'm talking Jr., Sr. highschool and college book loads. Elementary - no problem!

"I have two dogs that love this oil. Rock and HannahI took a photo of Rock in disbelief that he getting a plate of pure oil to lick. I normally mix it in their food.The oil is definitely helping their coats. Rock has very, very dry skin. I guess the best way to describe it is a bad case of dandruff but he's old and doesn't have a lot of hair so flakes just fall off him. I'm constantly dusting. This salmon oil has helped and I can visibly see a difference after two weeks.This is a huge bottle too. 32 oz. The bottle comes sealed and the pump is included in the bag.After opening, the bottle must be stored in the refrigerator.There is nearly no scent to this liquid.

"I have read other reviews and have to agree that going by the size chart, it does fit a little too snug. That can make it uncomfortable if your not use to wearing them.  I would consider going up a size.Remember, it has the velcro adjustable closures so while you are losing weight you can continue making a tighter fit. No biggie.The back has two ""bendable"" metal pieces just as a backbrace would. So not only is this waistbelt hiding your belly, it's helping to keeping your posture straight. That is a hugh benefit because bad posture shows not only in shoulders but also in your core. The back support is also what keeps the belt from rolling up or down on the top and sides.  As advertised, very breathable fabric and easy to use.This is one of the best tummy wraps I have used because of the quality and the back support. I gain weight in my stomach. From the back, I don't look as big as I am and my rear is pretty firm. I got this ""awesome"" trait from my mom.I perfer using the velcro wrap support over the corset for a couple reasons-1. I have children, I am no longer trying to hide a small pooch or make a hourglass figure.2. They are adjustable. I can adjust the size to whatever I am wearing over it.  Also if it becomes uncomfortable, I can easily take it off or just loosen it.Postpartum belt is provided by HOVEOX.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365QOIWX83NBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFE9S36#wasThisHelpful","R365QOIWX83NBP","A1FIA3GCTV8U3J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FIA3GCTV8U3J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased because we had a theatre room downstairs. There aren't any windows because it needed to be dark, of course. Now that the boys are older, they are never home.I got really tired of all the dishes laying around and having to take them upstairs before mold set in so we turned the theatre into a kitchen thinking  they could clean up their own mess. Well let's just say I don't have to tote the dishes upstairs anymore. Now I wash their dishes in their kitchen.Anyway, I decided I would take a break and be at the beach while I was cleaning.The backing is very sticky. I do have textured walls but also semi-gloss paint (some 3m have removed the paint) so I decided to apply to a poster board. Now I can move it around their kitchen, shoot maybe even their bathrooms when cleaning them!For the price, I think the print is great. This isn't a thirty dollar piece. It's a five dollar piece.

"I actually bought this as a Halloween costume for my dog along with wings. We ordered a large and cut the bottom off the dress. It didnt turn out too bad. :-)This set includes a white dress, a halo on a headband and a sash. No wings, no wand. I knew this before buying but they really need to change their photo. For one thing if you use the amazon app on your cell, you just see the photo and the first part of the description, so you it would be easy to miss. ""As described"" should mean the photo as well as the product description.The dress is thin. It would be ok worn over white but anything else would show through. Wearing a slip under would help. The flared mesh sleeves are cute. The belt is awful, just a peice of cut fabric with no hems. The headband wasn't too bad, it stayed on and didn't break.I had thought about making it. But fabric costs more than it used to and I dont have the supplies on hand. It would cost me just as much to buy the supplies.I had thought about sprucing up the costume. It would be easy to hot glue silver or gold garland around the hems and use garland for a belt. You could even add a small battery operated string of lights along the hem or belt. I also bought the wings, adding garland and/or lights around the wings would be super cute.Although thin, the dress held up. The fabric is stretchy so easy on/off.

"Super cute and soft. Fit true to size. I ordered the Bubble Dot and think its adorable, the colors are a little lighter than the pic. Love the pinks, baby blue and light green. There is no hard sole, the bottom of the sock is the same soft fabric as the top with dots of rubber to keep them from slipping.  Perfect for reading a book or watching a movie. I do wear them out on the porch, but that is the extent of outside wear. (You would feel it if you stepped on a rock.) The inside has a cozy fleece lining. Not too warm to make your feet sweaty, perfect over socks. I will probably wear a warmer slipper in the cold of winter, but these are great for fall or for cuddling up under a blanket. I will also wear other slippers if I will be on my feet for a long time, because you can feel the rubber dots a little through the bottom. Could be easlily rolled up and put in a tote or handbag when you go to a friend's house to slip on after taking off your shoes. Or at a relatives on Thanksgiving or Christmas. Speaking of that, they would make nice, inexpensive gifts. Who knows?

"I have tried different types but this is the one I prefer. It is soft and comfortable just like cotton guaze should be. It has a medium thickness, which I like because some guaze is way too thick and fuzzy and some guaze is too thin to help much.Each roll is wrapped in a sealed plastic bag so you know it is sterile. It helps cushion those painful areas. I have wrapped it around my foot and it holds up even when walked on. I put a non-stick pad on the wound, then wrap the guaze around it and tape the end in place with cotton or paper tape. Absorbant yet allows the skin to breath.

"The slippers size ""Medium"" fit correctly for me (7.5) but I do not like the construction. The nylon sides are too stretchy and do not have enough strength to hold the foot on the bottom when walking. The foot slips around the bottom.

"I have used this product for 4 years in tropical and freshwater tanks and it works quickly and safely to kill protozoan parasites such as Costra and Ich and some external fungi infections.  The ingredients are Formalin and Malachite Green. The dose is one drop per gallon, so a bottle goes a long, long way. You use it for a maximum of 3 days. It works to kills external parasites on gills, skin and fins. When treating for gill flukes on small fish, sometimes I notice a quick result, meaning the fish seem to start breathing easier in less than 6 hours. I personally prefer Quickcure to products containing prazi, because Quickcure is less expensive (only 1 drop per gallon) and because my fish HATE prazi for some reason. It makes them go crazy, 2 goldfish actually jumped out of the water after I added it! I don't know why our fish have such an adverse reaction to prazi, but quickcure seems less irritating to them.Every spring I dose Quickcure to prevent parasitic outbreaks. I don't remove the filters because, in my experience anyway, it does not have a big affect on the nitrifying bacteria. The most that has happened is a small increase in ammonia that lasted a couple days. By leaving the filters in, I want to kill developing parasite eggs and parasite embryos living in the filter.  Use of extra aeration is needed, because  Quickcure will remove a lot of dissolved oxygen from the water.Quickcure will sometimes cause a small increase in ph so keep an eye on the ph after adding it. Some say not to combine with salt, especially if you have high ph like we do, but I have had no problems using Quickcure in conjunction with a low salt treatment.Keep in mind that the goal of this is to kill external parasites and fungi, and often bacterial infections can piggyback on top. Parasites also decrease a fish's immunity. If you notice any signs of bacterial infection, a round of antibiotics may be needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353D48C62LTTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTH6EG4#wasThisHelpful","R353D48C62LTTK","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really like the way these cases look, fit and feel. I bought 3: this floral paisley one, the tree and a solid blue for my husband. I wanted something that looked nice but not too flashy, so these cases fit the bill.They have a soft coating that feels nice to the touch. Not too slippery.  There is a lip over the edge to protect the phones front when set face down.The floral and tree designs are pretty, the pattern looks 3d over the inside clear layer.We tried a couple other brands which we didn't like. The Eagle Hybrid my husband bought made the phone too bulky and heavy in his pocket. The Mpero Flex S did not fit tightly on the phone. This one was just right. Fits tight on the phone to protect dirt from getting in around the edges.I think an inexpensive hard case works just fine to protect your phone. I had a case like this on my iPhone 4S and after years of drops, spills and getting stuffed into a cluttered purse, the phone itself still looks perfect.Update Oct 2015: after 5 months of using the paisley design the finish started wearing off a little. It still works ok, but the silver is showing through on the sides.  So I slipped on the Tree cover, and I have ordered the Pink Lily because it looks pretty. I guess I should be upset, but for $2-$4 I am not out much. And I like switching out a new design on my phone. But the finish should last longer, so the rating went down to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMCQ3LSNPWQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIQGBCS#wasThisHelpful","R1GMCQ3LSNPWQM","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These cost roughly $1 each, the Fluval about $2.50 each. Have been using these a year with no problems. They are the same size as Fluval and fit perfectly in the canister. Very porous foam like fluval. These work just as well as the brand name and cost less than half the price. Good every day foam. They work to catch large debri before it enters the inner baskets in the canister. Easy to rinse out and reuse. I cut them up and use them in HOB filters also.One thing to note is that the Fluval ones are individually wrapped in plastic and in a box, but these generic pads are not individually wrapped. That is something to be aware of.This foam works well and I do recommend it for the price and convience. It is nice to have 12 on hand. As an extra precaution, I soak all products in a bucket of salt water (using aquarium salt) before use and then rinse well to clean and disinfect.

"I downloaded this collection of stories because I have been a fan of Stephen King since the 80's. I enjoy all his works, novels, short stories, movies, and TV shows. So I was so happy to find a collection of other good authors who also write horror stories. The title of the book says it all, Rage Against the Night. The general theme is people fighting against darkness and evil. I like reading short stories (especially scary ones) during the summer. You can read one while traveling in the car, sitting by a pool or beach, staying  in a hotel room, staying at a relatives's house, sitting in the park, in your backyard lawn chair, in your tent camping or sitting on the couch with a fan blowing on you. And then find yourself being a little scared because there could be someone lurking behind a tree or something creeping down the hallway...  While reading these stories on my kindle, I took notes on which stories were my favorite so I could look up books they published. It's always fun to find new authors. So far I downloaded The Keeper by Sarah Langan and really really liked it, finished it in a day. I am going to read more of her books next. Then go back to my kindle notes and read more authors.

"Very, very happy with the glass canopy! Fits my 10 gal. Shrimp tank perfectly. For lighting, I used a flathead screwdriver to gently pop the led lights off the old corroded black plastic cover, cleaned them with vinegar to remove water stains and used aquarium glue to glue the led lights on the middle of the new glass cover. Since they are glued under the brown middle strip, you can't see them from the top. The lights look pretty sparkling off the water through the glass!

"Nice addition for a small tank, such a shrimp tank, betta tank or a nano. They look cute in my 10g shrimp tank, I just let them float wherever.

"Bought this for my shrimp tank. The good points are that it does not suck up the shrimp like a power filter (even with a pre filter sponge they managed to slip in side). This sponge filter has lots of surface area to colonize bacteria. And it's a perfect shape to hide in the corner behind a plant.Like others have said, the weights do not hold the filter down. They should have left the weights off and added a suction cup. I used veggie clips on the air tubing, the suction cups on the clips hold the tubing (and the filter) down. Works ok but the filters still want to float up from the bottom when I clean the tank.My other dislike is that the plastic tube is not wide enough to insert an airstone into. So the sound you get is the sound you hear when air bubles out of tubing with no airstone. It's a pretty loud bubbling. If the plastic tube on top was just a little wider you could add an airstone to the end of the tubing, creating the fine bubbles that are not so loud.For the price it's not a bad filter but I do not recommend it for any messy fish because it doesn't clean like a power filter. If they could have added a suction cup to hold it in place instead of the ""weight"" and made the tube wide enough for an airstone, it would be 5 stars for a shrimp tank.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUCSU5ELC324/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VCHSKU#wasThisHelpful","R1FUCSU5ELC324","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An Occupational Therapist recommended that I get a transfer bench after having Knee surgery.Pros:. Fits  in my large size garden tub/shower. The side of my tub is 18"" high. This bench could go a few inches higher.. The legs are straight up and down - decreases the chance of tripping.. Easy to set up, everything snaps in place.. The legs are easy to adjust, no tools required as they lock in.. The back rest and the hand rail also slide in and click when locked  in.. Larger sitting area compared to a just small bench or chair sitting in the tub.. Sturdy, comfortable, dries quickly.. So much easier (and safer) than having to step over the sides of the tub.. The part of the bench that protrudes a little outside the tub is perfect for sitting on while undressing or drying off.Cons:. There is no place to set the shower head, an easy to reach built-in holder for the shower head should be added Instead of spending another $20 or so for a specially made shower curtain, I just cut a vertical slit on the bottom a shower curtain liner that I bought for a dollar. After closing the liner, I tucked a part under my leg to hold it in place. I cut it a little too high, but luckily no water on the floor and it saved me some money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKR6FH25JPN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IV0CTK#wasThisHelpful","RKKR6FH25JPN1","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*This is not written by DEAN Koontz, it's a self published book written by DAN Koontz.After seaching for Dean Koontz this appeared and I thought he had written a new interesting novel so I bought it. I cannot help but think that Mr DAN K. is using a name so close in spelling to get the seaches. I had read about ten percent of the book and I wondered why it was so dull. I revisited the online description and saw it was not DEAN K. My bad. Really, how did this book get so many positive reviews? (if have to wonder if acquaintances wrote them).  The premise is interesting and the potential was there but the execution falls short.From what other reviewers said the ending is disappointing so I am glad I quit when I did. The story plot is about coperate greed but I feel like it is greedy to use a name spelled almost exactly like a well known author in order to sell a self published book within the same genre. Not cool for those of who spent money on it.I am all for supporting new authors but there is a reason they have to pass a publisher's standards. From now on I am going to make sure the book is published by a company I know, no more self published. And I will pay very close attention to the authors spelling of their name. I think if this author had went through a publisher, the book could have been spiced up to be a really good debut.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6YA4WA6A358/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPR89BA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6YA4WA6A358","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter bought a set of these sheets and loves them, they are silky soft like you expect. So I ordered a set. Its like I got a competely different product with the Pinzon tag on it. I have bought Egyptian cotton for years now and I love it, but I do not love these sheets. Last Christmas I bought a similiar set at Target, those sheets are awesomely soft and comfortable with a nice heavy fabric and silky cool feel.  Love those Target sheets. But these Pinzon sheets not so much. I was really hoping for more after reading all the positive reviews. It is strange, like nine out of ten people are getting decent sheets but the rest of get a batch of scratchy sheets.  Mine feel scratchy, not soft like I expect Egyptian cotton should be. They remind me of my old flannel sheets that are worn and pilled.I have never had to use fabric softener on egyptian cotton. I washed them and dryed before putting them on the bed. But they still have a semi-rough surface. Not at all comfortable for sleeping on. And, oh man, for the wrinkles! Much more than any sheets I've ever owned, which I could overlook, but wrinkly and scratchy? Double whammy.I would return them but I washed them before using them and threw away the packaging. I am not saying these are so awful that a person can't ever sleep on them, I am sure after living on a deserted island a person would be glad to.

"Considering it was one of the least expensive I could find, I am pleasantly surprised at how good this bed skirt looks.  We got the navy blue color and it is not so dark that it looks black, just a rich dark blue.The fabric is a cotton polyester blend so it has a little bit of a satiny sheen but not too shiny at all, and its machine washable. When its in the dryer, the polyester helps keep the wrinkles out and keeps shrinking to a minimum. The fabric is not thick but I don't care as long as it looks good. Its not thin like some fabric that is so thin you can see through. The 18 inch drop is a perfect size for my bed.  The ruffle goes to the floor but doesn't hang down too far. I'm glad I got the tape measure out and measured the drop from the bottom of the mattress to the floor. (I thought we had a 14 inch drop and almost ordered that.)This skirt has a white fabric shell that goes under your mattress. This lining holds the bed skirt in place so it doesn't get moved around.

I bought many, many hair dryers throughout the years (usually cheap ones) and this is definitely worth the extra money.

"I ordered the case for the Asus memo pad. I chose it over a leather case because the leather cases are usually heavier and thicker. Its good points are that it fits snug, its very slim, lightweight, looks nice, easy to install, has a soft interior to protect the tablet and the camera and cables all work fine with the case on. But the flap doesn't keep it propped up and that is why I cannot recommend it. The flap folds up into a triangle but the soft fabric is slippery so it doesn't stay in a triangle.  Maybe it would be better if the inside were rubber or if it had a slot to hold the flap. Even if it did stay, there is no way to adjust it, so its either almost standing up straight or laying almost flat.  If you're reading and just want the tablet to stay upright it falls back down again.  I end up holding the case up and holding the back flap to keep it steady. I think a case should have two main functions, one is to protect the tablet and the other is for a way to prop the tablet up and hold it. This one gets an A+ on the first but fails the second part.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJ7G7LPQK81S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUXNTTC#wasThisHelpful","RXJ7G7LPQK81S","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, so I know there are people who are big supporters of this product and they will not appreciate any negative reviews of it. (I used to be one of them). But I have  to give an honest review so please hear me out.  Two of my tanks crashed after using regenerated Seachem. I am not saying this product itself caused it - I believe the use of BLEACH in the process of regeneration caused it. I followed the directions to use bleach to regenerate. I even doubled the Prime to neutralize the bleach after regenerating.Everything was going fine (my tanks had been cycled for years) then one day my tanks crashed. The only change was that I had started using regenerated Purigen. Ammonia and nitrites were reading at the highest level on the chart. The beneficial bacteria was gone. Some of my fish died, some got ich and some got fin rot. So I'm just saying be careful using BLEACH on anything you plan on putting in your aquarium if your aquarium is cycled. It has taken me a month to get the ammonia and nitrites back to zero. I treated the ich using medicines and am still giving some fish antibiotics to treat the severe fin rot.For me any benefits do not outweigh the risks and I am not using Purigen again. I will keep my tanks cycled to control ammonia and use floss to keep the water polished.If you are going to use this, be very careful using the regeneration process. Using strips to test for chlorine on the purigen before putting it in the filter would be a good idea. Or use the product once then toss it. I am just sharing my experience.UPdate 1-1-14: My tanks have been stable, everything within parameters, since I quit using this product. No crashes, no ammonia or nitrite spikes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKZ46NIQJ8BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002A5VK2#wasThisHelpful","R2BKZ46NIQJ8BB","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This plant is tall (18"") which fit nicely in my 75 gal. I say ""fit"" because it started to fall apart after about 4 months so I threw it.I liked the bottom holder because it looks like brown gravel ( not the pink bottom that some artificial plants have.)But it was too thin, it looks much fuller in the photo.And it tipped over all the time, even in gentle currents.  I had to kind of weave it into my other plant because any little current would tip it over on it's side. It finally just laid there on the bottom when I got tired of setting it back up. For the price they could have put more stems on it, designed it to stand on it's own, and made it so it wouldn't come apart.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8AXAUZ7JEZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LUUL48#wasThisHelpful","RV8AXAUZ7JEZ7","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Our softened water is 2 gh which is too low, especially for our snails that need calcium to grow their shells.  Experimented on test water and determined the correct amount of equilibrium to add.

"I loved the writing style, it moved at a graceful pace, like a slow sweet song telling a tale - which I appreciate in today's fast paced world. Beautifully written tale about a couple living Alaska and suffering hardships, enduring freezing weather, having little money, worrying about having enough food to survive, and on top of that not being able to have a child. There is distance between the husband and wife and their marriage is strained  as these challenges wear on them.But then one snowy night a magical child appears. She is part human but also partly wild, as if she were made of the couple's  desperation mixed with the forest's sweet yet savage nature. The mysterious girl comes in and out of their lives, giving them much needed hope and bringing the couple closer. It's as if the couple were sleep walking, only worried about surviving but that's it. The child wakes them up and they begin to feel love and overcome the pain and grief of being childless.The story takes many twists and turns as the girls grows up, still being half wild. This book made me feel sad sometimes but also made me feel happy for the couple, being blessed with a magical child who gave them so much.I think many of the negative reviews here are written because some people did not realize this is based on a fable, so it is not a realistic account of life in Alaska wilderness. That's why the details are not always explained logically and there are animals, mystical creatures and forces of nature at work. If you are not crazy about fantasy, I would pass on this book. I personally loved everything about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFRW8IU39W1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316175668#wasThisHelpful","R3CFRW8IU39W1J","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a using Fluval HOB filters for years on my tanks, but got this Fluval canister for my 70 gal FW. I have to say I am so glad I did. It has been keeping my tank cycled for over a year now. I rinse out the baskets every other month and that's all I've had to do.I also use a big HoB for cleaning the water and for additional circulation.The good:.  there is a lot room inside the canister and 3 large baskets so you can add lots of media. I took out the carbon and added more bio balls.. the filter runs quiet.. I like having the canister in the cabinet. It looks better than a filter hanging on the back. And the smell stays inside the canister!. The tubes going inside the tank are semi transparent.. Very sturdy and well built. It has ran problem free for over a year.The bad. Although it says it is works up to 70 gal,  it really is not enough filtration.  I would  go bigger.. Cleaning can be a wet affair. When you shut off the valve and remove the tubes from the top cover, a little water still comes out . I highly recommend putting this canister in a bucket or have a tray under it if you dont want water on your stand or foor. The directions say to carry the whole thing to the sink, which means pulling the cord with the canister, cover and all. It's heavy being full off water. When removing the cover, water splashes no matter how careful I try to be. Maybe if they had some way to suck some of the water out of the canister before opening it.Overall its a very reliable and well built filter and I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HVMRLOFJ7XSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QRDDWY#wasThisHelpful","R2HVMRLOFJ7XSY","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First time I tried a batch using the product's instructions, had little luck.  Then I saw the instructions listed in a comment here. When I followed this, had a big hatch rate. My fry and adult guppies love it! It's fun to watch them chase the baby brine, and it's good exercise for them. Every day I have a new batch. I didn't have another heater, so I bought a large plastic measuring cup with a wide handle from the local dollar store. I put one air hose in it, used a rock to hold the air tube inside the measuring cup, added 1 cup water from my cycled tank, added 1/8 tsp eggs, mixed it up, then hung the measuring cup on the inside of the tank wall. Turned on the air, let it run for an hour, then add 1 & 1/2 tsp uniodized table salt. Make sure the tank cover is on.Let it run for 24 hrs. Turn air off, remove measuring cup (leave air hose in) shine flashlight on side of cup for 15 min, use turkey baster to suck out brine, squirt into coffee filter placed on cup. After water has dripped out, swish coffee filter in tank to remove brine. Pour water from cup back into measuring cup, add 1/8  tsp eggs (no salt) put back in tank and  in 24 hrs -more brine!This way I use the heat and air hose from the tank. Works great and only cost an extra dollar!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10A6JZBIJB6NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000255SXC#wasThisHelpful","R10A6JZBIJB6NW","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works ok as a floss to put in front of biomedia  and then replace a couple times a week. However, quilt batting works just as well and it is cheaper. (you can get a big roll at a craft store or walmart..)This product itself is not strong enough to work as a  bio-filter and  grow beneficial bacteria for a cycled tank.  The pad I cut for the filter fell apart after a couple weeks. When it accumulates waste it shrinks.  I lost the bb in one tank and had an ammonia spike. I can't say that this media caused the problem, but I replaced it with another brand. (The Fluval foam pads that I'm using  have lasted 12 months). I leave the Fluval pads in the filter to hold the beneficial bacteria.  I cut pieces of cheap quilt batting and use it as floss in front of the Fluval pad to catch waste, replacing the batting it as needed, usually twice a week. A roll of quilt batting will last months. I have 4 tanks.While this product works ok as floss, I have other found other options that work better for me and are more economical.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8BQE8U53468/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002565PW#wasThisHelpful","RR8BQE8U53468","A3HSFWAJGSSVZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HSFWAJGSSVZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did not had ANY luck getting females to birth in this. The birthing female guppies became very stressed when put in here.  They felt trapped and vulnerable and did not birth one fry even after being left in here for a couple days. But when I removed her she dropped fry. Lesson learned.However it works great for raising fry once you catch them and get them in. You can monitor their feeding and growth. Instead of having the box float willy-nilly all over your tank, just press the side against the side of your tank and the pressure will make it stay put.*** I did a few modifications. Removed every-other side rail, drilled quarter inch holes all over the solid sides for ventilation, removed the cover and other extra parts, anchored the whole thing upside down with rocks, and put it on the bottom of my tank. The females give birth over it, and the fry learn to hide from the adults in here and can freely swim in and out between the rails and holes. Nature takes its course, I stay out of it, the mothers birth when they want and the fry are safe.

"I received the Rockport Luxury Cruise Penny Loafers for review through the courtesy of the amazon vine program.I got the Rockport loafers for my husband, who has to dress well for his job. We were both impressed with what they looked like straight out of the box. Very nice appearance, we could tell they were nice shoes. He put them on and said they were extremely comfortable and reminded him of some other shoes he has that are calf-lined and soft. He said the Rockports would not take long to break in.After walking in them for a while he mentioned they felt strange because they had virtually no heel and he felt as though he were tipping backward, but he got used to that very quickly. The tread on the bottom gave excellent traction. After wearing them to dinner and a graduation ceremony that night, he said they had rubbed a blister at the base of one of his big toes. He is going to try to stretch that part with a shoe tree and see how it goes. He really wants them to work out because he likes the way they look. Hey, that's usually what I say about my pinch-y shoes!Full marks for looks. Very attractive and expensive-looking shoe. Fit as expected in length and width. Soft and flexible. Good traction on the rubber-like soles.

"I received a bottle of Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua for review through the courtesy of the amazon vine program.I could probably talk about Eternity all day and not give you an accurate description of what it will smell like on you, in particular. So many factors come into play in determining that. How old are you? Do you take medications? Your body chemistry and diet, as well as your level of anxiety can affect the fragrance on your skin. The length of time Eternity will last on your skin is completely determined by your body chemistry, and whether or not you have dry or oily skin. But when making comparisons with other fragrances, it may be possible to give you an idea of what Eternity is like.The closest comparisons I can make are to Armani‚Äôs Acqua Di Gio (at 20. an ounce) and ‚Äì closest by far ‚Äì to Acqua Di Parmi (at 38. an ounce). All of these are crisp, clean, but not citrus scents, appropriate for the office or important social occasions. And all of them are on the subtle side. I‚Äôve known guys who use their cologne like pheromone in hope the scent will attract a mate. It‚Äôs more off-putting than anything else.

"I have used two of these to warm a large 12x20 foot building with a 71/2 foot ceiling. It is insulated but has no other source of heat but these oil heaters. They have kept it reasonably warm this winter, although it hasn't been an extremely cold one. Our temperatures got down into the teens and twenties at night, but the days were mostly in the forties. So if you live in Vermont, I don't know how they would work, but hopefully this gives you some means of comparison. Totally silent, safe, issue-free.

"I keep ordering this same pocketbook after the previous one wears out. It fits my needs perfectly. It holds my wallet, and checkbook, and cash, and has various pockets for receipts, credit cards, photos - but it isn't any bigger than a thick paperback. The loops that hold the strap are the first place that wears out. And I must admit that I often over-stuff it and weaken the corners of all the pockets. I could have it restitched at a leather repair place, but they are so inexpensive that seems a waste.The leather is nice, the snap closures are sturdy. The strap is a little thin and long, but I have a wider black leather strap I just keep putting on my new bag when I get it. There are two separate flaps and pockets in the body of the bag. In one I keep a small aspirin tin, a foldable brush and mirror combo, folding reading glasses, and a lip gloss.

"I don't see how anybody takes their temperature any more since digital became the standard. I have guarded my mercury thermometer like a gold ingot since they went out of production. Any digital thermometer will give you four different readings for four different tries, one right after the other. And I don't care if it's a forehead thermometer, or an ear thermometer, or ....whatever. They just cannot be consistent.So when we took my grandson to the doctor, I made a point of noticing what they used to take his temperature. It was this very same Welch Allyn thermometer. I did a little research and decided this is probably the only type of thermometer that actually works - accurately and consistently - besides my mercury thermometer. When it arrived I ran my own series of tests to compare it for accuracy, and I can state unequivocally that it matches the accuracy of a mercury thermometer, which is unquestionable.It is expensive, yes, but without the level of accuracy you get from this thermometer, what's the point of even taking your temperature. And with kids, do you want to know if they are spiking at 102 degrees - or just somewhere within 3 degrees plus or minus that number? There just is no price you can put on believing in the accuracy of the temperature reading when you are making important decisions about your child's illness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZ7SRQXMK2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GI0J6G#wasThisHelpful","R1FZ7SRQXMK2QH","A1BZN88T4GSZG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BZN88T4GSZG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I keep a PikStik ""grabber"" in my pantry area, my basement, my bedroom closet, and now a fourth one in the garage. I can hang it anywhere and it takes up much less room than a step stool, which is how I used to reach tall shelves and out-of-reach objects.The entire end piece is ridged for gription (even though that's not a word, it should be). You can grab handles and small objects with the pincher on the end, or bigger bottles, boxes and objects with the cuff, because they are both slip resistant. There is a limit to the weight you should try to pick up with these, because they are somewhat light-duty. A really heavy bottle of bleach will twist them out of shape and possibly get dropped in the process.The handle fits all size hands, and is easy to squeeze. I have had no problem using it one- or two-handed when necessary. At 32"" it is adding almost three feet to your height, and for me that's over eight-and-a-half feet of reach. Really the only limit to its usefulness is, as I mentioned, the weight restrictions on what you should try to lift.

"I have had two of these shades. They don't last forever, but they are definitely worth what you pay for them. I use mine on a balcony door with a small window in it. It doesn't get a lot of opening and closing or a lot of abuse, so it stays in pretty good shape for a long time. We do have kids in the house and they play around with the shade now and then, and I must agree with the reviewers who mentioned that the slats are thin and vulnerable. I would not use this on a high-traffic door.However, the shade clings tightly to the metal of your door. It takes a lot of downward pressure to pull it loose. In all likelihood, it would not come off with everyday use. It opens and closes easily, and the shade is prevented from swinging away from the frame when you open and close your door. If you need one for a small window, especially, or just a more or less out-of-the-way door that doesn't see constant use, then this is the best choice for the money. Looks good, works well, stands up for a reasonable amount use and abuse.

"What a fun pregnancy book!  I had reviewed the Mayo Clinic book and stated that it was the only prenatal book one would need in preparation for baby.  Well, that might be the case for all of the important, basic information needed during pregnancy, but I have to qualify that previous review because, after skimming sections of this Chocolate Lovers book (I just received it today), I find that it's a great addition for those of us who are fascinated by the science of pregnancy and the strange things the body does.  It's a light, fast read, especially considering the good amount of references to scientific studies, and surprisingly enjoyable because the topics covered are interesting and sometimes odd-ball.  I'm not one for pop-science as a rule, and I can't stand cutesy pregnancy books like the ""Girlfriend's Guide"" kind of stuff (bleh), but I needed something a bit more unusual and off-beat than the overly straightforward May Clinic book to keep me entertained and engaged during this pregnancy.  Plus, for those of us who want a list of works cited....it's here!  Yes!  My one complaint about the Mayo Clinic book was that there isn't a bibliography or ""further reading"" section for those of us who understand that the sciences include ""gray areas"" as ""facts"" become out-dated, debatable, or whatever.  Jena Pincott gives various studies, all presented as objectively as anything really can be presented without it sounding absolutist, and she does so with a nice, flowing, engaging, readable style.  As someone who teaches rhetoric and literary analysis, style and presentation are as important to me as the information given in a text; Pincott is just scholarly enough without being pedantic, and she includes personal anecdotes and some literary styling that is much more engaging than the typical fare.  And after reading Baby 411, which has a terribly condescending and judgmental tone, I appreciated that Pincott respects her readers enough to assume we have brains in our heads: she speaks to the reader and not at the reader, as though she's sharing some really fascinating, strange information she's learned while asking her own crazy questions about why and what her body is doing during her pregnancy, just in case we might find it fascinating, too.  Very nice.  : )Things to keep in mind:- This really is a pop-science book with some educational value mixed with a heavy dose of entertainment value.- This is not a guidebook: it is not meant to offer specific advice about doing one thing or another during pregnancy and/or child-rearing, but there is a nice, concise ""Lessons from the Lab: A Summary of Practical Tips"" section just before the list of source material that could be useful for some.  It's mostly common sense, but sometimes we need reminders of that common sense stuff, right?  I know I do!  Like everything else in this book, I appreciate how Pincott presents these lessons.- This includes bits and pieces of personal experience, so if you're not into the use of personal-story-as-frame-narrative before scientific studies are referenced, you might find it off-putting and too subjective for what you're looking for.  As a reader, I found this technique engaging and effective in holding my interest.- Along with personal anecdotes, Pincott references pop culture every now and then.  I didn't find it annoying, pandering, or excessive at all.I look forward to reading this in more depth and highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1A18C4HTLE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439183341#wasThisHelpful","R1R1A18C4HTLE7","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to preface my review by stating that I agree with much of what these women state in this book.  I appreciate most of the advice, when it's actually presented straight-forwardly and without bias.  With that said, I can't tolerate the way in which most of this ""advice"" is stated.  These women are terribly condescending and judgmental in tone, and I'm not talking about the drawing of conclusions based on medical fact.  I'll take that judgment, if you supply me with some legitimate references and studies.  But to be so snarky and self-righteous in one's advice comes off unprofessional, rude, and incredibly biased.  For example:Under the heading ""reality check"" (really?  I need a section called ""reality check,"" as though I'm not aware of reality? how presumptuous!):  ""Have a media management plan for everyone in your family - that includes YOU....Just turn it off and watch your shows later.  And don't get us started on parents who check email, latest stock quotes, or Facebook posts on smartphones while their little ones play on the playground, or worse, in the pool.  Turn it off!""Okay, I agree with the overall point, but only somewhat because of the way it's stated, as though this is a pet-peeve instead of a legitimate developmental or safety issue.  I don't much like the ""Entertainment Generation,"" either, and my university students laugh at what a Luddite I can be.  I don't have Facebook, I don't own a smartphone, I, too, get annoyed and disgusted when I'm at a restaurant and see a mother ignoring her child in favor of texting on her phone, and I'm not all that interested in television; however, it's the way these ladies lecture at the reader that I find infuriating, throwing in the demanding ""Turn it off!"" in an attempt to add credibility and authority to their statements.  If it had been stated as ""it's a good idea not to be distracted when...because...."" or ""studies have shown that it's important to spend one-on-one talk-time with your child because...., so we suggest distractions be put away,"" or whatever, then it wouldn't have been so bad.  Much of this is common sense and based on etiquette - there's no need to get self-righteous and bossy in your advice-giving. ladies.  Here's my demand of YOU: don't make demands of my family, and don't presume I'm an idiot who is looking forward to neglecting her child in favor of a television show during her first year on this planet.This is only one example out of MANY.  With faulty rhetorical strategies such as using ""Crazy, eh?"" at the end of a statement, the sarcasm and downright lack of respect for the reader undercuts any of the useful information I could find in this book.  Furthermore, the organization is all over the place.  Under the category of discipline you'll find questions about colic.  I never would have thought to look under ""discipline"" for something that can't be...well...disciplined.  Wouldn't it go under ""health"" or ""baby's well-being"" or something of that nature?  Good luck ""disciplining"" your colicky baby!I'm giving one extra star and considering keeping this in my home only because some of the information is useful.  But I stand by my 2 stars: I really don't like this book, I feel like I'd hate these authors if I ever met them, and I think there could be better options out there that I have yet to find.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let everyone know!  For now, I'm finding the Mayo Clinic guide helpful, and once baby is born, I'll look elsewhere for actual (and factual) ""clear answers & smart advice"" for baby's first year.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8SYEDT2N5S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO9M3DU#wasThisHelpful","R3J8SYEDT2N5S5","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seriously - this is the only pregnancy book you need.  I received a few others as gifts, and I never liked the tone, style, or presentation in the other books.  Whether it's the ""hey, girlfriend - let's talk about being prego over a cup of decaf Starbucks and shoe-shopping!"" (yuck) or a condescending/patronizing tone as though I'm a knocked-up idiot, I found myself quickly donating all other books except for this one.  The Mayo Clinic Guide is to-the-point but friendly enough with excellent pictures and descriptions of each stage, and the doctors' tone doesn't question your intelligence or know-how.  I appreciate that the source material is valid as this is a peer-reviewed effort including many doctors in the field listed as contributors (I'm a PhD/professor who teaches source evaluation, so yeah - it's important to me), and I like the logical organization of the chapters.  There's isn't too much information stuffed onto one page, and the layout makes it easy to skim to the parts you're most interested in at the time of reading.  I also greatly appreciate that the book doesn't get preachy, doesn't sway from trying to remain objective, offers different birthing options without judgment, and includes helpful charts and lists along the way.  I found everything spot-on (I'm now entering my 7th month of pregnancy), and it helped me to know what to expect with each ob appointment, what questions I should ask, and when to start planning for things such as interviewing pediatricians, filling out hospital forms, etc (each of these are included as reminders for each month of pregnancy, so it's not like you're bombarded by information up front that you'll have to remember throughout all 9 and 1/2 months of pregnancy).  I have found it most useful to skim through the book in its entirety upon first perusal, and then follow along as each month progresses.My only suggestion is that for those of us who like to check references or refer to them ourselves, it would have been helpful to have a bibliographic list of sources used in the book.  For example: ob doctors often frighten women away from all forms of vitamin A because of one study that was done in the 1990s, but vitamin A as beta carotene hasn't been shown to cause birth defects like vitamin A in the form of retinol has, which is stored in fat cells, and vitamin A as beta carotene is necessary for fetal eye development (this is based on newer data I've found through my research).  I had to argue with my ob about this when I told her I wouldn't take prescription prenatals and preferred my own vitamin mix - well, it was for many reasons, including the synthetic junk and dyes in most prescription prenatals (boy, I've got some stories about pharmaceutical reps pushing those things and their reasons why they include dyes in them that have been linked to birth defects, one of which included an old man making the statement that ""pregnant women don't want to take ugly brown pills; they want to take pretty blue ones!""  I kid you not.  Apparently we women are that dumb and shallow, according to pharmaceutical reps), but a scholarly article would have been nice to give to her in my defense of taking a holistic vitamin cocktail that included vitamin A as beta carotene, a vitamin that is flushed from the system once the body has taken what it needs.  I do realize that many readers wouldn't care about this kind of information, but it wouldn't hurt to include a ""works cited"" or ""bibliography"" page at the end with helpful, legitimate scholarly articles and information about various studies, and maybe some parenthetical citations throughout that could lead us active readers to the biblio reference.  More work?  Sure, the editors would have a good bit more work to do gathering this information, but it would make this book absolute perfection!Anyway, I do highly recommend this book for those of you who want medical advice from medical professionals, delivered in an approachable yet no-nonsense way that keeps you happy and motivated without the saccharine pandering often found in pregnancy guides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390MOUOWDVEMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561487171#wasThisHelpful","R390MOUOWDVEMK","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm highly sensitive to smells and hate most fabric softener scents, not to mention that I don't like the idea of drying my clothes in chemicals and synthetic fragrances.  I was skeptical of this product from some of the reviews, but these lavender dryer bags work wonders for me.  Yes, they leave a faint (very faint) smell of lavender, which might not be strong enough for some people but is PERFECT for me.  And for some unknown reason, one of these bags tossed in the dryer seems to do away with static without the need of dryer balls.  I don't know why, but it works for me.  Keep in mind that I don't own anything 100% polyester or other man-made fabrics, and this has only been used with cotton and bamboo with maybe a bit of poly or spandex for stretch (like cotton blends), so I can't say how it works for those kinds of fabrics that tend to have the most static like all poly or rayon.  I use one of these bags for about 4 loads before I decide to switch it out for a new one, using the old bag in my drawers and closets to make everything smell good.  I highly recommend these - wonderfully natural lavender scent!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EF6F2RAWIJDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DMDOUO#wasThisHelpful","R2EF6F2RAWIJDP","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two of these kitty sill perches - one in my living room and one in my bedroom - and my two cats adore them both.  For those having problems: 1) use industrial-strength velcro.  I've had one of these kitty sills for almost 10 years now, and it held up great in my old apartment for about 6 of those ten years with the use of industrial-strength velcro.  Then we moved it from the apartment into our first home, put fresh pieces of industrial-strength velcro and have had zero problems since...and one of those sills is often in direct sunlight.  2) you have to hear the legs snap into place.  If you didn't hear the snap, then they aren't in all of the way and yes...they will fall out.  The product isn't defective - put some muscle into it!  I know this because I had the same problem for the first week I had the first one I bought, but I eventually had that ""doh!"" moment when I realized that I was the problem.My two cats are between 10 and 12 pounds, and I've seen BOTH of them get on this thing together (although inevitably one cat freaks, hisses, and they scatter).  It's never fallen, but keep in mind that they haven't spent much time on it together, so I don't know how much weight the thing can take.The ONE complaint that I have is that, for the cost of a replacement cover, you might as well just repurchase the entire thing and have a spare frame.  Needless to say, after almost 10 years of cat puke, sun damage, and washing machine wear, I had to buy a new one for the living room because the egg-crate cushion and cover were in such bad shape and smelled off.  Come on, K&H!  You need a more affordable replacement for this thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250ATYF1I9DYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000795XJC#wasThisHelpful","R250ATYF1I9DYE","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my husband's macbook pro several years ago because the sharp edge was hurting his wrist (he's a web developer/programmer, so he's on it all day).  He loves this thing!  My dad got the same laptop as my husband a few months ago and had the same complaint (well, that and his old brain was having a difficult time going from a PC to Mac, despite how intuitive Macs are), so this past father's day, we got him one.  He, too, loves it and calls it a life-saver.  Too bad Apple hasn't done anything about this problem yet, and I hate the feel of the newer laptops (which is why I'm still on my old, trusty black macbook that I still love but is quickly becoming obsolete), but at least this serves as a nice, comfortable solution.

"These are getting returned.  It's rare that I post a 1-star rating, but these are horrible.  They stink of chemicals (on natural wicker?  why??), including the unattractive liner, the stitching is awful, the color of the ribbons is awkward (the worst blue, pink, and green were used - not soft colors, doesn't look like the picture and not suitable for my nursery), the size is awkward, and the bottom of the basket is uneven, making the baskets sit awkwardly and wobble.  To make matters worse: I was obviously sent someone's else's returned item that was barely repackaged because the ribbons were removed from the little ziplock bag for one of the baskets.

"These storage boxes are really great!  I bought several of these for the Better Homes and Gardens storage 9- cube organizer, and they fit perfectly and are much better quality than the ones usually sold for that organizer.  When the rigid bottom is pushed into place, they're pretty sturdy.  The apliques are vibrant and fun and totally pull my simply-decorated neutral nursery together.  The only reason I removed a star is for those pesky tags.  They don't seem as intrusive when you're looking at a picture of one box, but when you have an organizer or shelf with several of them lined up, as I do, you'll quickly grow to HATE that the room is suddenly a marketing ploy for 3 Sprouts, and those tags do distract from the adorable animal pictures.  If they weren't large and bright white with red lettering, it wouldn't be so bad.  I don't like name brands on things like clothes and home-goods, and I refuse to let my home become a billboard, so, despite knowing that it would leave holes (the fabric on these boxes is a tight-weave polyester, so you can guarantee the holes are there to stay, which wasn't the case when I removed the tag from the 3 Sprouts hamper, which is canvas), I took the tags off.  Yes, you can clearly see the outline of a rectangle of holes when up close, but I'll take that over the bombardment of advertising from a distance.  Still, it would have been nice NOT to have to do this.  I wish 3 Sprouts would reconsider the use of those obnoxious tags on every single one of their products!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QML3RYE8C297/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Y7P2MY#wasThisHelpful","R2QML3RYE8C297","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a discussion about Trader Joe's toothpaste, I had originally stated that I much preferred this toothpaste and had switched for good.  WRONG.  Sure, the flavor was great, my teeth felt clean, my gums seemed to be doing well after a horrible experience using Trader Joe's Baking Soda toothpaste, which left terrible cuts and sores all over my gums, and I thought it was doing a good job overall.  As the annoying health person I can be, I pushed this product on my friends and family.  My husband wasn't thrilled with the results and his breath would be kickin' in the middle of the night, but he said it was better than others I had forced him to try (hehe).  My mother liked it for a short while and thought she, too, would permanently switch...until she developed thrush (!).  She switched back to her old standby, regular Colgate, and her mouth is fine again.  I thought, ""well, that's my mom - she might have problems that I don't have because she's a smoker and soda-drinker"" (I know...awful).  After about a month and a half of using this, however, I developed a severe abscess that ruptured and produced a significant tear along my gum line, enough so that my recession went from a 1 to something like a 4 in no time.  I now will need to one day get periodontal work done to help close the gap left after what I thought was a cut that had healed, but my dentist believes it was an abscess from something in the toothpaste.  Who knows for sure, but I'm not a smoker, I don't consume a lot of sugar - no soda, I stay hydrated and eat well, and the only change I had made was this toothpaste.  Yes, I have sensitive gums that are prone to recession, but I had NEVER experienced anything like that before, and it was awful.  I have now switched back to Colgate Total (yes, I know I know...the ""devil"" that is triclosan and whatever other crap is in there that I was trying to get away from), but at least my gums are back to good health with no sores and zero bleeding.  I've been weighing the pros and cons of various health products for years, and this is the one thing I simply can no longer experiment with because my gums are apparently so problematic when it comes to 'natural' toothpastes.  So, if you have no problems, awesome - you might really like this toothpaste as a good alternative.  Sure, there's sls in it, which you'll read has its problems, and sure, Tom's was bought out by 'the man,' and yep, it has fluoride, and everyone has his or her opinions about that, but I really wish this had been at least a more natural answer for me than others I have tried, including my current brand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFH79I8QY4L4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUJ17JK#wasThisHelpful","RFH79I8QY4L4X","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to preface: I've been jokingly described by my students as hippie and ""granola,"" and I'd like to think I'm a very open-minded person.  Also, I find eastern philosophy truly enlightening in many respects, and I enjoy yoga and belly dancing, so I thought this would be perfect as a relaxing alternative to the more intense prenatal cardio and sculpting I typically do to stay active and strong during this pregnancy.  As an on-again-off-again professor of rhetoric, I should have paid closer attention to the ""mind conditioning"" part of the DVD's title: I found myself rolling my eyes, getting annoyed at the constant lecturing and obvious bias, and just wanting some relaxing music and brief instruction so that I could relax and do my thing.  I didn't want an extended history lesson while stretching or opinions about eastern vs. western birthing techniques, and I certainly don't need a spiritual guide in the form of an RN belly dancer; I have (many) books and articles for history and medical advice, and I'm a bit too, well ""secular"" shall we say, for all the overt (and I mean OVERT) heaven and god talk, something I have never encountered during an actual yoga or belly dancing class.  Sure, talk about becoming one with the things around you, finding one's center, nature, earth, aligning the chakras, or whatever, and it would work for me; there was something about the attempt at sounding soothing that bugged me, too, as though it were forced, self-conscious, and performative.  If you have sensitive ears for performative tones and cadences of speech, you'll quickly pick up on what I'm saying.  I'm 5 months pregnant and all I felt with this DVD were boredom and frustration, not because the exercises were difficult but because they were repetitive and completely effortless.  This DVD simply doesn't do it for me, and I, personally, didn't find it fun or enjoyable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJXVIIGGTCZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W2HZ1C#wasThisHelpful","R2HJXVIIGGTCZI","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this directly from a reputable store, and I agree with those who say this product leaves one's skin too white.  This stuff is so oddly tinted and way too white.  I have a light complexion - not quite porcelain, but ""fair"" to light in the winter.  With pregnancy and the summer sun, my skin has darkened only very slightly and has more redness than anything.  My point is: I'm not dark-complexioned...not even tan, and this stuff makes my skin look sickly pale.  I don't know how this could be marketed as a universally tinted-sunscreen, and if you have any color at all to your skin, stay far far away from this product.  I can only imagine what this would look like on someone with any sort of tanned skin.  It has a strange yellowness to it, too, and it gathers in every crease and pore on my light skin just as though it were plaster.  Also, as others have noted, it doesn't smooth over the skin at all.  I added one star because I like how it doesn't leave my skin greasy and it feels good on, but that's it.  I'd only use this if I were working in the yard or playing at the beach and didn't care about the white tint.  If you're looking for a good natural brand with better tint, you might try Pacifica's CC cream.  It's fantastic, covers well, and has a more natural tint to it (I use the ""light"" one, but there's a darker tinted one, too), but it does leave my very oily skin a bit too shiny by the end of the day, but nowhere near as bad as most sunscreens.  For darker complexions that tend to be dry, Coola is very good, but it leaves my skin very slick and shiny, and it's much too dark and shimmery for my skin.  For now, I'm sticking with Pacifica's CC, but it would have been nice to find a heavy-duty higher SPF sunscreen for those days when I'm in the sun for a while.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Z37R3T773YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHGPLDQ#wasThisHelpful","R15Z37R3T773YC","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My old review (keep reading for revised):What I really like:1) The size is great - plenty large enough but not bulky.2) The patten is nice and neutral.3) The plastic coating makes for an easy cleanup.Minor issues:1) I can't seem to get mine to lay flat because of the creases in the fabric; this isn't a very pliable material, and the creases don't seem like they'll be comfortable for baby to rest on.2) It can be a bit difficult maneuvering the pad into a nice, uniform rolled shape.  I think this has to do with the lack of pliability of the fabric.3) Most annoying: one of mine has this strange dark fuzz or lint on it, and when I tried to wipe it off, I realized that the little hairs/fuzz/lint are UNDERNEATH the plastic coating, so there's no way to remove them.  It's a shame because the chevron design on the fabric is really nice, but all that fuzz detracts from the cleanness of the pattern.  The other changing pad is perfect, so I think this was just a manufacturing issue when this particular part of the fabric was made.  Somebody forgot the lint brush before plasticizing it!Overall, these are very nice, but I think they are way overpriced for the quality of the product.REVISED REVIEW:After receiving a comment from Talia@snugbug about contacting her in reference to the defective pad, I emailed her and received some of the best customer service I've experience in a long time.  She quickly sent me a replacement pad (this one is PERFECT) and gave me some advice about softening the pad by washing it.  She suggested that perhaps the pads had been stored in a hot warehouse before being sent out, which might have contributed to the stiffness and creasing.  I think she was right!  After washing the pads in warm water and hanging them to dry, they are now pliable and much easier to roll up.  I still think these are a bit overpriced but are very nice changing pads, and I highly recommend The Snug Bug for their SUPER fast customer service.  I'd purchase these again and will consider them for future baby shower gifts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQVGIN0T45AN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3HGGBY#wasThisHelpful","R2AQVGIN0T45AN","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a great find!  I had already made a Beatles mix cd for future nugget, and when I saw this one by Caspar Babypants, I immediately thought, ""yuck - why not just play the originals?""  But I have to admit that he's done a great job making what are already adorable Beatles songs even more kid accessible in a way that won't grate on mom or dad's ears - it really is adorable, but not sickeningly so.  The soul is still there.  There are some Beatles songs that would be perfect for babies and young children like ""Me and my Monkey"" that needed to be toned down a bit for very little ears, which is why that particular song (although it's the funniest, cutest song) was left off my mixed cd.  Caspar Babypants hit the nail on the head with that one!  The same goes for most of the songs on this cd.  My only minor complaint (and it's super minor) is that some songs sound a bit off or just needless in their simplification.  For those, I'd rather just play the originals (ex: ""Blackbird"" - the original is just too lovely, and Caspar's ""Here Comes the Sun"" is a great rendition, but it's another I'd rather just play the original).  With that said, I have several of Caspar Babypants' cds on my baby registry now, and I can't wait to introduce nugget to mommy and daddy's music taste, which is as far away from ""Kidz Bop"" as it gets!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R122R8S35QAWCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENWD85K#wasThisHelpful","R122R8S35QAWCV","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terrible bird bath!  I bought this to replace a WAY less expensive one that was about the same color but more attractive from Lowes or Home Depot - I forget which store.  I loved that old bird bath with its true robin's egg blue/green (this ""antique"" one is more of a bright blue color) and its sturdier base, had it for a few years with no problems at all despite some icy winters, but something knocked the bowl off the base and it cracked in two.  Because bird baths are seasonal products in most stores, I was forced to look online.  I liked the idea of this ""antique"" style bird bath having a bowl that locks into the base, thought it was attractive enough online, so I went ahead and payed quite a bit for it.  It was okay when it arrived - not exactly as attractive as pictured, but it was shipped well and worked fine.  Well, I bought this October 30th, and now, 6 months later, it's falling apart.  The crackle of the glaze causes chunks of the ceramic to chip off (I'm sure in no time the bowl will completely crumble into pieces), and the piece that fits into the base broke off.  I'm so disappointed with this bird bath.  I spent 5x the cost of my first bird bath for this piece of junk, and now I'm off to find a replacement now that they are back in season.  I really hope to find the old one I had, and with a little Gorilla Glue, I'll be able to permanently fit the bowl to the base, and that's fine with me.  Do yourself a favor and do NOT purchase this bird bath unless you're okay with thinking of it as a disposable, temporary piece.  And for a hundred bucks, who would want to replace this every 6 months??

"Great workout dvd!  I'm not into prenatal yoga, and I wanted something a bit more upbeat with both cardio and sculpting.  This one is a winner!  Sarago is a pleasant instructor: as other reviewers have stated, she isn't overly peppy or annoying; she talks TO you and not AT you, which I really like.  The exercises are just challenging enough for me but easily modified for a more intense or less intense workout.  Each workout segment targets specific areas, but she still keeps your entire body moving and engaged regardless of which you choose.  The warm up is fun, the stretching nice, but my favorite is the upper body cardio sculpt.  It isn't too much for my tired, pregnant self to accomplish, and my arms are definitely showing more definition.  There are moments when Sarago gets off-beat in her repetitions, but it's fine - not really distracting or anything.My one minor suggestion is to have just a bit more low-intensity cardio.  I don't have room in my house for a treadmill or elliptical, and it would be nice to get that 30 min. of activity in other than the focus on sculpting, especially on a rainy day when I can't walk my neighborhood.  Also, and this is minor but worth mentioning, the dance-beat music grates on my nerves after a while.  What's worse is that there are songs that I definitely recognize and wouldn't have minded if they were the original (ex: Guetta's ""Titanium"" featuring Sia and Ellie Goulding's ""Lights""), but they have different words and a second-rate auto-tuned singer that sounds like a Brittney Spears blow-up doll to me.

"Unlike the other negative review, I actually really like the feel of this clipper.  I have small hands and paper-thin nails, and I really like the delicate hand-feel of this clipper.  Unfortunately, it isn't sharp enough (or even enough? maybe doesn't apply enough pressure or something?  I can't quite tell), so it doesn't cut cleanly, leaving behind a rough, jagged area where the nail has been clipped.

Or is my older bag mislabeled and misleading, so they corrected the ingredient list to include fillers that had always been present??  Whatever the case, my review will be for what I purchased months ago, and if anyone has repurchased directly from Amazon (not a third party vendor) and noticed a change, feel free to comment..  I love this stuff!  I've been using it in my tea for months now, and it dissolves instantly, adding just the right amount of sweetness with a touch of honey flavor (not as overpowering of a honey flavor as liquid honey).  For now, ignorance is bliss, and even if there is sugar added to this product, I find the flavor a nice change from the typical sugar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27S4MH0PLPB9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GM969M#wasThisHelpful","R27S4MH0PLPB9G","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although nothing tastes better than fresh brown basmati, it takes FOREVER to cook!  Personally, I don't have time to soak the rice and/or boil it for an hour, which is what brown rice often requires (I'll admit: pressure-cookers freak me out.  Silly, I know, but this is coming from someone who also refuses to fry anything in a pot of oil).  I've tried several other companies, but Seeds of Change has the best tasting instant brown basmati.  I haven't found there to be a plastic taste like other microwave rice has, and the quality seems consistently good for me.  I've purchased this rice twice now from Amazon, and I've never received a bad batch.  It's pricy, no doubt, but splitting a bag between my husband and myself every once in a while isn't going to break the bank.

"I had tried the Iveta cranberry-orange scones before the strawberry, and they have been a consistent favorite: lighter and somewhat fluffier than some scones I've had in the past, but still rich in the middle with a crispy outside like a scone should be; not too cake-y, not too biscuity...just right.  Now the strawberry is my very favorite, and I switch back-and-forth between the two for my scone fix.  The strawberries are substantial and taste super fresh once the scone has baked - it's a scone miracle!  They are quick and easy to whip up in a hurry, and Iveta doesn't skimp on ingredients.  I've never thought, ""Boy, I wish there were more fruit pieces in this scone.""  After I put all of the ingredients together in a bowl and knead it by hand into a thick dough, I section it out into 6 wads (I like my scones a bit bigger), push each wad into a section of my non-stick scone pan to form the triangles (no greasing necessary for the non-stick pan), brush the tops with a bit of heavy cream (as the directions state), and bake for the recommended time - voila!  The only time I've messed up these scones is when I added too much cream, thinking I could make a thinner batter to pour into my scone pan (I know, I know: common sense dictates that it wouldn't come out right, but sometimes commonsense mysteriously disappears).  Came out yucky, greasy, and like a dense cake, so don't deviate from the directions on the box - they are spot-on and work great every time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IX5VX84X43HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5DQSS#wasThisHelpful","R2IX5VX84X43HA","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I actually review the tea, let me go ahead and say that I did not purchase this tea at full price.  I would NEVER purchase this tea at full price.  There's something about the marketing of this tea, from the whole ""Cup of Couture"" slogan to the name ""Soho Earl"" that made me roll my eyes when I saw a box of this tea in the discount bin at my local grocery store, but the price was slashed from ten bucks to three and a half bucks.  Sold!  (despite the gimmicky marketing)Surprisingly, I've found the teas from Talbott to actually be very, very good.  The earl grey is STRONG in the bergamot department, which gives the tea a bright citrusy flavor.  If you like lemony teas with a bit more depth from a good black tea, you'll probably like this tea.  However, I don't reach for this tea as often as I do my Mighty Leaf earl grey because the bergamot is sometimes too much for me - maybe even oily, if that's the right word I'm looking for?  I much prefer Talbott's ""Green Tea Indulgence,"" which has a lovely fragrant fruit aroma and flavor that works really well with the green tea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSACT27VGVHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1Z6IRW#wasThisHelpful","R3HSACT27VGVHV","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: Maty's in no way states or implies that this vapor rub is meant to be applied inside the nostrils, and this might not work for everyone.  But for the past couple of years, I've had a debilitating sensitive nerve in one spot way up inside my left nostril.  When the air is cold and dry, this area of my nose becomes scabby and unbearably ticklish, causing me to sneeze uncontrollably, my eyes to water, and my nose to run non-stop.  It got to the point that, if I cooked dinner on the stove, the onions, garlic and/or spices I used would inevitably irritate that one nostril, leading me to feel sick for days after.  While doing research about this issue online, one commenter made mention that he found Vicks Vapor Rub to work wonders at alleviating the irritation.  I don't like using products with petroleum jelly in them, especially in a place like inside the nose, so I started searching for a more natural alternative.  I've been applying Maty's with a q-tip inside my nostrils off-and-on for a few weeks now whenever the flair up occurs, and it has been a life saver!  I don't know if it's the mint having a numbing effect, if it's the oils moisturizing my nose, or a mix of both, but I could kiss that commenter for recommending Vicks, and I could high-five Maty for creating a natural version. If you have dryness or other nasal problems brought on by allergies, cold dry weather, or a cold, you might give this a try.  It's very soothing, there's no burn or other negative reactions to the product, and the wintergreen scent is relaxing.  If you're nervous about applying it inside the nose, I suggest rubbing it directly under the nose.  My dad used to put Vicks under my nose when I had coughing attacks caused by colds, and as strong as the mint in Maty's is, I'm sure it'd be just as effective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Y6KKSOSEURT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005X74DFS#wasThisHelpful","R14Y6KKSOSEURT","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tray is attractive enough and certainly LARGE enough to use for my 4 cup teapot, a teacup and saucer, a snack plate, and other tea accessories to keep in my office during a long day of research and writing.  I like the antique look (by the way, those ""cracks"" people are talking about in their reviews are NOT cracks; they are built into the laminate to give it a distressed look and do not affect the integrity of the tray).  The bottom is thin and more cheaply made than I would like (the sides are much nicer), but it does the job.  For the money, I haven't found anything that works as well as this tray while still being attractive, and I'm happy enough with the product.HOWEVER, and this is why I remove one star, the mothball smell is incredibly strong and stubborn.  I had to air out the tray outside in the sun for two days after I got fumigated out of my office from the stench the first day I had it, and then I used J. R. Watkins lemon cleaner spray to clean it (this helped a lot).  While the smell has finally improved to the point that I can leave the tray in my office with the door closed (now at day 3), those of you who are sensitive to mothballs, like myself, will still smell it when near the tray.  I'm hoping the smell continues to improve, but it's at least tolerable now (trust me: it wasn't tolerable the first couple of days, and the smell about knocked me out when I first opened the box!).  So, I do recommend the tray for the cost, look, size, and sturdiness for the money and free shipping, but just know what you'll be getting into as far as detoxing it before using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWAURHI0BM45S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00489UE7I#wasThisHelpful","RWAURHI0BM45S","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to collect vintage teacups and saucers, and Royal Albert has always been a favorite; however, the vintage sets for Royal Albert can be quite expensive if you can even find the pieces you're looking for.  I knew for the price that these wouldn't be as fine as my old-school teacup and saucer sets by Royal Albert and Minton, but I'm not disappointed in the least.  They're a bit heavier than I'm used to, but the print on the cups is attractive enough (although, like any factory produced prints, the pattern is obvious and cold in its repetition unlike the warmth and variety in hand-painted china).  This set is especially fun to pull out when I'm using the matching Royal Albert 100 years chintz teapot set with friends and in-laws who, admittedly, I might not trust using the classic stuff (terrible, I know - but it's the truth!  You tea folks know what I'm talking about.  There's nothing like sitting next to someone who clangs a teaspoon against fine china to set my teeth on edge!).

"Usually I'm a Wusthof kinda gal and have a beautiful set of Wusthof knives for food prep; however, I bought this MIU knife set several years ago specifically because they are inexpensive and can go in the dishwasher for everyday use (I'd NEVER put a Wusthof in the dishwasher).  This is now my 2nd set of these exact knives, and I've been using my first set for at least 6 years now (if not 8).  They are finally starting to show a bit of cracking in the rivets from the constant dishwasher use - not enough to get rid of the knives, but I wanted to make sure I had a replacement just in case (which is why I now have the 2nd set).  For the price and look of these knives (they match my Wusthof set perfectly!), you really can't go wrong with these for basic, sturdy steak knives that work very well when cutting anything from tender meat to tougher steak to veggie patties.

"My husband and I had this tea years ago while having afternoon tea during our anniversary trip to the Biltmore Estate.  We had a choice of several loose leaf teas (there were sample tins of tea to smell), and this one was so wonderfully fragrant that we both immediately chose it.  And what an excellent choice!  It's slightly fruity, but not over-poweringly so - an interesting blend of floral, fruity, and black tea with a hint of sweetness.  I enjoy it both hot and iced, and I like that there is no need for sugar because of the sweetness from the fruit.

I should have listened to the other review that complained about the stiff bristles because they really are too stiff to clean plastic straws without severely scratching them.  I was planning on using this brush for my reusable Starbucks straws, but I'm worried that this thing will destroy them.  However, I think I might find other uses for this brush, such as cleaning the nooks and crannies in my cats' drinking fountain, which is made of a much harder plastic than Starbucks straws.

"This product works wonderfully for those of us who don't mind a bit of sweat but want protection from funk.  I was skeptical of this product, just as I'm skeptical about most beauty and health products, but I was absolutely amazed by how well this stuff works to control body odor.  I never have BO since I started using this product over a year ago. Growing up at the beach and swimming in the ocean almost on a daily basis, I never really had any use for deodorant or antiperspirants until I moved away for college (just goes to show you that salt water truly does keep the odor at bay!). After a few years of using antiperspirants, I had started getting clogged pores and small cysts under my arms, so I was feeling desperate one day while perusing the health aisle at my local organic/health food grocer when I spotted the kind of crystal deodorant shaped like a rock, no aloe.  I started with the other brand that did not contain aloe, and while it worked, it burned, was difficult to apply despite being wet (the one with aloe is slicker when wet), and started to become jagged and actually CUT my underarms.  No joke.  Disappointed but still willing to experiment, I went back to the health store and found this Naturally Fresh crystal deodorant with the aloe.  PERFECT.  When wet it goes on smoothly (must be very wet), dissolves evenly over time, and it does not burn at all.  And these tubes last forever - I've had mine for almost a year.  Also, the effect lasts for DAYS.  Zero smells, and I think this stuff actually does help with the sweating a bit, the same way a dip in the ocean does - just don't expect the same control as an antiperspirant, which is fine by me.  Sweating is healthy, and I think this particular crystal deodorant is an excellent product and an excellent value here on Amazon.Update: I've finally coerced my husband into trying this salt deodorant because I was tired of throwing away t-shirts that had developed permanently hard, discolored areas from antiperspirant.  Shockingly...he likes it!  I never thought he'd ever give up his Gillette, but he's done for good!  However, there are a couple of caveats.  Because he has armpit hair, unlike myself, the large stick doesn't dissolve as evenly for him as it does for me.  It's kind of like the hairs create indention-lines all over the surface, making it less smooth and more prone to cracking and crumbling (which it finally did after just a couple of months).  When I travel, I use the mini tubes of this exact crystal deodorant, so I let my husband give one of those a try.  He has found that he prefers the mini-stick over the regular-sized tube, and it seems to dissolve better for him.  This also helps with the problem that some have mentioned about the twist mechanism malfunctioning after a while.  I'll agree with that critique - mine did the same thing, but I simply unscrewed the larger part of the crystal and began using it without the plastic dispenser.  By the way, the mini tubes do not have a twist-up mechanism.  Second caveat for the easily-funky: if my husband doesn't make sure to reeeaaaally spread the crystal around and into/underneath the armpit hair, he develops a slight bit of BO - nothing that anyone could ever smell, though, and I've only smelled it when checking his tees before laundering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36EDFINNU4186/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JVWU2E#wasThisHelpful","R36EDFINNU4186","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used the Lillian Vernon guest towels for years now and really like them, albeit the designs can be tacky depending on the year.  Based on one of the reviews here, I went with these guest towels because, as the reviewer stated, it IS a better deal, and I like the lack of design.  These Simulinen towels are of good quality.  They feel nice, and they work well.  However, I didn't realize how narrow the towels were going to be in comparison to all other disposable guest towels I've ever used (including Lenox buffet napkins).  These Simulinen towels look a bit ridiculous in the holder I've been using all these years.  Apparently those few millimeters make a big difference in presentation.  Also, they were packed in a way that wrinkled and squished the corners, making for a messy presentation for guests.  I recently repurchased some Lillian Vernon towels on sale, plus a discount code, and they ended up only a few dollars more than these, which I now consider well worth it for guest towels that don't get used all that often except during parties and the occasional guest.  If you use disposable guest towels on a daily basis, and if you don't mind a rather large gap between towel and edge of holder, then you'll probably really like the Simulinen towels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNDFKKM30IJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FPAF6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1JNDFKKM30IJF","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sukhi's sauces are amazingly good.  Seriously, the BEST quick indian food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  My in-laws are from Kerala, and I wouldn't be embarrassed to cook them a meal using these sauces (and then hide the evidence, of course!  what?  me use a pre-made sauce?? never!)  Everything I've ever tried, from the vindaloo to the masala to the spice mixes for potatoes, etc, have been wonderful, and you can switch up the meat (I usually use chicken breast, but sometimes use lamb or pork instead, and sometimes just veggies).  Last night was the first time my husband and I had tried the korma, and it might be our favorite now.  It's got a bit of a kick to it, which is unfortunately rare in most americanized indian sauces.  I added skim milk instead of cream, and it still came out great.  I usually saute onions first (but not always - if I'm in a hurry, they get left out), then brown about a pound of meat, next the sauce packet and milk, and then add a a couple of boiled potatoes (cubed) and half a can of peas.  I then simmer until the potatoes have absorbed the flavor.  Each packet is for about a pound of meat or veggies, but I've used one packet for a pound of meat plus about half a pound of veggies and it was fine - very strong, concentrated sauce.  Last night I used 2 packets because I used about a pound and 1/2 of chicken breast, 2 large potatoes, and peas, and the meal lasts for about 3 night for the two of us. It makes for a easy, fast meal, and goes great with rice or naan.  If you live near a specialty grocery store, you might check to see if they carry the frozen sukhi's meals, too.  The samosas are especially delicious, and my husband and I practically live off the frozen naanwiches during the weekends!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PXWWBXF6CYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SWL5CO#wasThisHelpful","R25PXWWBXF6CYJ","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had such high hopes for this litter!  Personally, I love the smell, and I've been using World's Best for 6 years and love it, too.  My cats prefer World's Best, but it is annoying that it doesn't cover litter smells very well (although I will say that I prefer the smell of natural litter over that heavily chemical-perfume smell of most clay litters).  And yes, I scoop the boxes (we have two) daily, sometimes twice a day.  When I spotted World's Best with lavender, I was thrilled!  I love the smell of natural lavender, and I had hoped it would solve the smell problem.  The first day I used it, I was in love (with a litter?  yes!).  The litter box closet smelled so much better.  The smell of the lavender is VERY strong but pleasant and earthy, but, unfortunately, my cats don't care for the lavender smell at all.  I even tried mixing the lavender with the original to make it less strong.  My more finicky cat started spraying the wall next to the litter box RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME after I switched to this litter.  Okay, cat - you've got my attention!  Now I've got a major problem with keeping the entire area near the litter box scrubbed clean so that my cat doesn't maintain this frustrating behavioral problem.  Because of this litter, I now have to pull everything out of the litter closet nightly to check and see if my cat has decided to spray (how does she manage to spray in strange nooks and crannies and between the two litter boxes that are side-by-side??).

"I had been looking for the perfect pasta bowls for a reasonable price (does that even exist??), and found that I kept going back to these for the large size.  The designs on the bowls are cute, although a little sloppy looking.  The size is perfect - nice and big and deep enough to hold a good amount of pasta without being too deep, allowing for better sauce distribution.  However, right away I noticed a design flaw that has bothered me about a lot of the ""pottery"" (for lack of a better word at the moment) coming out of China: the bottom has exposed ""clay"" (what IS that white powdery stuff??) that has not been glazed, thus allowing water to soak through and up under the surrounding glaze.  I know from past experience that this can often lead to cracks and chips, even when hand-washed but even more so when put in the dishwasher.  And it just seems unsanitary to me - moisture collecting and remaining inside the bowls.  I have just now placed one of the bowls in my sink for a few minutes, and water has seeped into the ""clay,"" darkening the painted picture where it shows the moisture trapped underneath the glaze.Meh.

"I have been a Neutrogena fan since I was 8 years old, and I'm now in my early 30's - so we're talking over 20 years.  I refuse to wear heavy or obvious make-up, and even light foundations end up an oily mess on my skin (except for Almay's Nearly Naked - that stuff is great, but doesn't moisturize effectively and doesn't keep my skin as matte as this one does).

Most anything going on my face bothers me in some way, whether it's the smell, the oily feel, or my skin's reaction to it.And now there's Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer!  The PERFECT balance between super lightweight coverage, moisturizer, and fantastic SPF that smells nice and doesn't make my skin oily or break out.  It doesn't cover much, but it's not really intended to cover.  It doesn't advertise that it's a foundation, and it certainly isn't, but that's what is so great about it!  I don't want to cover my skin - I want to enhance it, which it does.  It's super natural, super light, and has definitely improved the texture of my skin after only a few uses - fantastic!  I actually went to sleep last night forgetting to wash it off, which I usually would never do, and my skin looked great this morning.  With any other product I'd be a pimply, oily mess today.  And as someone who has pale skin (I use the Fair to Light #20) and suffers from slight melasma and discoloration from past acne scars and heavy sun exposure, but also someone who isn't afraid to show that I have human skin (ugh...nothing looks worse than that plastic heavy foundation look.  I'd rather show my flaws!), Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer is the perfect solution to even-out my skin tone and make it look more youthful and glowing.I couldn't be happier with this product, and I highly recommend it to those who hate the feel of make-up and lotions on their skin and want their natural colorations to show through.  I never would have thought that I'd actually find a tinted SPF that I not only tolerate but actually enjoy using!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ER4ZW1MBCE99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYTSMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ER4ZW1MBCE99","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had this Sleep Mate sound screen (model 980) for over 10 years and cannot sleep without it!  This thing is built so well that the ""sound"" it produces has not altered any all this time.  I usually set mine at its deepest yet loudest setting (you twist the outer and top parts around so that the frequency changes via the variation in the size of the openings).  I am such a light sleeper that I take this wonderful little machine with me to hotels and when staying overnight at friends' and inlaws' houses.  While I got used to the whirring sound immediately (and my masseuse uses one of these in her massage room, by the way), I will admit that my husband took a while to get used to it.  Now he also cannot relax or sleep without it.  Furthermore, this machine is MUCH better than those that make specific sounds (rain, ocean, etc).  I have very sensitive hearing (have played music all my life), so the ""track"" rotation of those other sound machines makes me crazy.  If you are sensitive to music, you will definitely notice the pattern of those sounds.  With the sound screen all you get is a constant and natural air-blowing sound from the internal fan.This sound screen is expensive, but if they still make it like the one I have had for over 10 years, then rest assured that you are getting your money's worth!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLHWZR6CJ7NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002SI1LA#wasThisHelpful","R2LLHWZR6CJ7NU","A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Make no mistake: this book has a very creepy premise. A serial killer is imprisoning two victims at a time, giving them no food or water, and leaving them only a loaded gun. Neither will be set free until one kills the other. Author M.J. Arlidge cleverly recognizes that the only thing arguably more twisted than hurting people is forcing them to hurt each other.With a premise this creepy, it's no surprise that the book has a very dark feel. Inspector Helen Grace is in charge of solving the series of crimes, but (of course) she has her own baggage, some of which is unspecified but which goes back to her abusive childhood. There's a group of fellow cops to round out the station, including a young, attractive female cop trying to get pregnant; a divorced dad with an alcohol problem; and a nasty boss.""Eeny Meeny"" never grabbed me the way some police procedurals do. Sure, there was suspense, a few plot twists, some back story, but for me the disparate pieces never jelled into a really compelling read. That's not to say it was bad, either; a bit overlong, maybe, and in the end, a bit too neatly tied together, but the author has promise. Overall, the book felt like it had been done before. Maybe crisper writing and a more vigorous edit would have helped.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIH8ERYQNB1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475496#wasThisHelpful","R2FIH8ERYQNB1C","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine a world very similar to ours, except everyone knows the precise date of their death. That's the world Denton Little lives in, and his quiet suburban life is rapidly reaching its predetermined end; as the book begins, his death date is just one day away. Denton is a charming character and his voice is funny, real and sweet. He wakes up on the day before his Death Date hungover, in the bed of his best friend's sister, not quite remember what happened the night before. In just 24 hours he'll have to face the great unknown, but in the meantime, he's got to face attending his own funeral, saying goodbyes, figuring out why he has a weird purple blotch on his leg, and maybe learning a little more about his biological mom, who died when he was born. Although the subject seems morbid, in the hands of Lance Rubin, the narrative is actually quite humorous and fun to read, subtly raising the intiguing question whether it's better to know the exact date of one's demise, or whether it's preferable to not know and try to live each day unsure whether it will be your last.I didn't expect to enjoy this book so much, but it was really funny and creative. The characters seemed very real, and I loved Denton's voice. The story takes some unexpected twists and the ending wasn't quite what I expected. A quick read that manages to be both touching and laugh-out-loud funny, while it also makes you think a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MN4YKW6P3US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553496964#wasThisHelpful","R34MN4YKW6P3US","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Sand, born Aurore Dupin, is a fascinating figure: she was a talented and prolific writer, but given the way human nature works, she's probably more remembered for her propensity to dress as a man and for her liaisons with other prominent figures, such as Chopin and de Musset. Elizabeth Berg tackles this complex and multilayered figure in the form of a fictionalized ""memoir"" -- Sand's life as she herself might have described it. It's a lot of territory to cover and Berg does a good job of synthesizing it, pulling out the most important vignettes and people in Sand's life. Berg captures the feel of the time period in the way she imagines Sand's voice. While I ultimately enjoyed the book and was glad I read it, there were a few reasons I didn't give it five stars:  first, the book is a bit slow to get started. As I got to know Sand and the people in her life, the book became more interesting to me, but I didn't get grabbed by the book in the beginning. Second, I found the frequent shifts in time -- Berg goes back and forth between Sand's childhood, the early days of her marriage, and her post-separation life quite a bit in the beginning -- confusing. It would have worked better had Berg interspersed fewer, longer scenes with fewer shifts in time. Finally, the voice of Sand as she writes about her life was definitely arm's-length, the voice of someone who is looking back thoughtfully on her life. That makes it harder for the reader to feel as intensely about what's happening -- it makes it harder to get caught up in the book and lose yourself in it.Overall, though, I enjoyed the book and found Sand to be a fascinating and inspiring woman. I would have enjoyed it more had the imagined voice of Sand been more passionate and in the moment, rather than arm's length.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A23EZF2QR489/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993152#wasThisHelpful","R1A23EZF2QR489","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the message of this book:  that you never know who has the capacity, deep down, to be a hero. Certainly Billy, the protagonist of this story, doesn't sound like a typical hero:  he's a kid who's a bit of a troublemaker, his dad's about to see the family home foreclosed upon, and Billy's sister is unexpectedly pregnant. But Billy is smart, and tough, and stubborn, and he really really wants to help his dad make enough money to hold onto the family home -- and maybe start a fruit stand with him.This book is written in the first person, using vernacular speech (which I usually don't care for, but it's effectively done here), and we get to know and like Billy, and appreciate where he's coming from. When teenage boys start to go missing, Billy is concerned. He's observant -- more so than people would assume -- and he dearly wants to earn the reward for finding out what happened to the missing boys. That desire to help his dad and save his home leads Billy to take some big risks.This was a quick and suspenseful read and I became very attached to the voice of Billy, a good-hearted kid put in unsupportable circumstances who does the best he can. I loved that Billy's best ended up being pretty darn good. Lots of action and thrills, a good detective story, and a heartwarming ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V85L2IW9QGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544308271#wasThisHelpful","R15V85L2IW9QGG","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of this series, featuring an ex-soldier who returns to his small hometown in rural France and serves as chief of police. Bruno is a wonderful character, complex, entertaining, and endearing. In the seventh novel in the series, the autistic son of a village resident returns under awful circumstances:  Sami was sent to a school for specialized education, only to end up in Afghanistan making bombs and detonators for Islamofascists. Sami has been returned to France but now is the subject of a legal ""custody dispute"" -- will he be extradited to the US to stand trial for his part in the deaths of soldiers caused by the explosives he helped create, will he be subjected to the French justice system, or will he be found mentally unfit to stand trial and be hospitalized? While the politics and diplomacy plays out, danger resurfaces in the form of Islamofascist terrorists who want to kill Sami before he can give Western authorities information about the terrorist group.There's a lot of suspense and action, making this book more like a thriller than the usual police procedural/mystery, and I confess that I missed the less frenetic pace of the typical Bruno book. By pulling in a plotline involving terrorists (and therefore government antiterror forces), the book lost its focus on the village and townspeople, and became more like a Hollywood action movie. I prefer the cozier pace and stories that center around town residents, rather than the Good vs. Evil action/thriller plot of this book. Still, the book is well-written, with its lovely countryside settting and at least brief glimpses of favorite characters from previous books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSIPT09IIVZ7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354150#wasThisHelpful","RSIPT09IIVZ7B","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like knitting sweaters but aren't crazy about the finishing process, then you'll definitely want to check out ""No-Sew Knits,"" by designer Kristen TenDyke. Twenty lovely patterns for women's sweaters are included, with chapter order roughly corresponding to difficulty from easiest to hardest. Chapter 1 includes basic stitch patterns like garter stitch, stockinette, and moss; Chapter 2 provides six patterns and six stitch patterns that can be mixed and matched to suit the maker's preferences (each stitch pattern uses the same multiple in its repeat) incorporating cables, lacy stitches and texture; Chapter 3 focuses on lace stitchwork; and Chapter 4 features cables. Especially helpful are sections allowing customizing patterns, for example a section that shows how to add a hood to any sweater; how to knit seamless hems; adding seamless pockets; adding bust darts; tips for shaping lace, and so on. The patterns are mostly cardigans and pullovers, with some vests, shrugs and tanks in the mix. One thing that Interweave knows how to do is publish beautiful books, and ""No-Sew Knits"" is no exception. Nice big size, lots of clear color photographs, charts, schematics, and plenty of tips and tricks.  Stitch patterns are both written out and charted, a bonus for those who have a strong preference for one or the other. Yarn weights range from chunky to fingering, with workhorse worsted-weight most frequently used. Sizes range is generous; most garments start at 29-32 inch finished bust circumference and go up to 50+ inch finished bust circumference.So if you'd like to explore the world of seamless sweaters, or just are looking for a timeless collection of versatile sweaters, ""No-Sew Knits"" is an excellent choice.Please note that I was given a review copy by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4JRBVM0P2J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODF0UHG#wasThisHelpful","R2T4JRBVM0P2J1","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked Kimberly McCreight's first book (""Reconstructing Amelia"") but maybe my high expectations made me a more demanding critic of her second book. ""Where They Found Her"" focuses on the discovery of a newborn baby's body in a wooded area near a New Jersey university. The main character, Molly Sanderson, is an attorney turned local newspaper reporter, just starting to come out of a severe depression caused by the stillborn daughter she delivered. At first, both Molly and her husband aren't sure if she can handle the story, but as she becomes more involved, she becomes doggedly determined to see the story through to the end. The story deals with the strains on her marriage and her lingering strong emotions about her lost child, as well as the mystery of who the baby's parents are and how the baby died. (And there are several subsidiary storylines involving other people in the small college town.)The mystery in the book wasn't bad, but I felt as though there were too many characters in the book, and therefore too many shifts in perspective: at various times, we read Molly's point of view in the present; transcripts of her psychotherapy sessions from the past; Molly's on-line columns and various on-line message boards; the perspective of Barbara, the police chief's wife; Sandy, a nineteen-year-old dropout who is trying to get her GED and is entangled in the baby case; excerpts of Jenna's diary (Jenna is Sandy's mother)... it just got to be too much to keep straight. I think the constant shifts in POV and number of characters made it harder to bond to any particular character, and some seemed not to come alive or be believable for me. The number of contemporaneous plot lines also got unwieldy -- the book addresses Molly's grief, Molly's marriage, infertile friends, the police chief and his wife (and issues with their daughter and son), Molly's friend and issues with her kids, a possible sexual predator at the university, a weird security guard, a death at the university in the past, Sandy the dropout and her druggie mother Jenna, on top of the dead baby storyline.McCreight is a good writer and I think a tighter focus in the next book would really help her talents to shine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7Q05NDC56GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062225464#wasThisHelpful","RI7Q05NDC56GT","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very grim but true story of a young man whose father was a Liberian dictator:  Charles Taylor was ""president"" of the ravaged African nation of Liberia; his son Chucky grew up in the United States, arriving in Liberia as a teenager. Journalist Johnny Dwyer traces Chucky Taylor's life, perhaps trying to isolate that moment when a seemingly typical suburban teenager decided to throw in his lot with a brutal dictator (as is often the case, it's hard to find the exact tipping point; Chucky had a propensity for substance abuse and violence even in his younger years). Chucky not only came to live with his father and get to know him, but became the head of a powerful militia ostensibly responsible for his father's security called the Anti Terrrorist Unit, or ATU. As a young man in his late teens and early twenties, he was responsible for setting up a training camp for the ATU, as well as recruiting, equipping and disciplining the ATU's members. It was in this role that he was accused of obscenely violent acts against ATU members, rebel soldiers and refugees. The last third of Chucky's story traces the federal government's investigation and use of anti-torture legislation to charge Chucky and, eventually, convict him. Hard to read parts of this book, hard to imagine the suffering of the people living in this region, hard to imagine how someone could sink to the depths the book describes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPST4KI7812QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307273482#wasThisHelpful","RPST4KI7812QR","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexander McQueen and John Galliano were two fashion superstars with a surprisingly amount in common:  they attended the same school, grew up in tough London neighborhoods, struggled financially in their early years although had critical notice, went to work for prestigious French fashion houses owned by a bazillionaire and his conglomerate, then both flamed out in the 2000s (McQueen committed suicide, while Galliano's substance abuse and arrest for anti-Semitic slurs caused him to be fired and basically unemployable for a while). Author Dana Thomas followed the men's lives in real time and has pulled together additional research and interviews to write what seems to me to be a very thorough treatment of their lives.Having not studied fashion history, it was fascinating to get a look behind the scenes of two extremely talented designers as they broke into the fashion world and struggled to create designs that were true to their artistic vision, yet commercially viable. And both designers appeared on the scene at a critical juncture for fashion. Their very unique styles and talents were a wake-up call to the industry from an artistic standpoint. Both entered big-time couture houses during a transition period, as wealthy executives and their corporations began buying up formerly-independent fashion houses -- and clearly Dana Thomas thinks that the overall state of the fashion world has suffered as a result of that transition.Lots of quotes from intimates of the men, background information that placed events in context, evocative descriptions of clothing and shows, a healthy dollop of sex and drugs, it's all here. And it's both inspirational and utterly tragic that two such talented individuals ended up destroyed by their own excesses, the stress of their work and other factors. Well worth a read, even if you aren't a fashion maven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTY9SRIJGZEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204942#wasThisHelpful","R3GTY9SRIJGZEI","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bittersweet YA novel is told from the perspective of Sam, a high school sophomore whose best friend committed suicide. Sam's had a rough time: he was sleeping over at his friend's and discovered the body that morning. Sam and Hayden were the best of friends, bonded together by their common interests in music and gaming, years of friendship, and their own shyness (which prevented them from seeking out other people). The two were bullied mercilessly by Hayden's older brother and friends, which made their daily lives miserable. The book presents Hayden's suicide as kind of a mystery: Sam needs to find out whatever he can to understand why Hayden did it. Author Michelle Falkoff skillfully teases out the story of Hayden's last night, and the multiple things that coalesced one fateful night at a party to make him lose all hope. Without ruining the plot, I did appreciate that ultimately Sam reaches out to some other people in his life, forging new connections and helping him to better understand himself and Hayden. And the book ends on a hopeful note. Overall, a well-written book that left me a little misty-eyed but also says some interesting things about isolation and friendship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JWRKW121EHTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006231050X#wasThisHelpful","R1JWRKW121EHTW","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But Poppy's heart isn't in the match, and she climbs out a window to jilt her fiance at the altar. Poppy retreats to her father's cottage to lick her wounds and figure out what to do next -- and is driven there by a young vicar who is kind and charming. When she tries to look up the vicar to thank him, she discovers he's gone. And vow to find him, wherever he may be.Thus beguns a romantic adventure story, very light in tone but well-written, in which Poppy gets her first job, travels to the Middle East, gets kidnapped, and discovers more about herself and what she wants out of life.

"Having read Marilyn Johnson's The Dead Beat, a fascinating and offbeat look at obituary writers, I was eager to dive into Johnson's latest book, which takes a look at archaeology. Not the idealized version we see on TV, or the Indiana Jones swashbuckling, get-in-there-and-grab-the-priceless-artifacts version, but the kind where underpaid, highly-trained scientists try to extract the leftover pieces of past societies, preserve them, and analyze them to try to learn more about their creators. Johnson interviewed many archaeologists and joined them in the field. She traveled to conferences, helped out at various digs and sat in on college classes. As a result, she not only gives the reader an overview of what it's like to work as a professional archaeologist, but she also highlights the frustrations and limitations that these scientists are faced with every day. She gently points out some of the absurdities within this world but always is on the side of these professionals who must travel constantly, face high levels of unemployment and do battle with real estate developers, hostile governments and others who view archaeology as a waste of time. Even if you never dreamed about discovering a lost world or finding that elusive fossil that changes our thinking, you'll enjoy reading about those who do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX2RH5CMQ9US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062127187#wasThisHelpful","R1BX2RH5CMQ9US","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not often that a book makes me laugh out loud as often as Caitlin Moran's ""How To Build A Girl."" The book is a fictionalized (I assume) version of Moran's own childhood, focusing on her seventeenth year. The main character, Johanna, lives in a down-at-the-heels industrial town in the UK in the early 90s. Her parents are on the dole, she has four brothers and money is tight in post-Thatcher England. Johanna throws herself into music, avidly borrowing albums from the library and becoming entranced with the club scene of the times. Although she's only a teenager, she manages to score a job reviewing albums for a music magazine, which takes her inside the exciting, tawdry, thrilling world of excess that is 90s rock-n-roll. The book is a modern coming-of-age story, as Johanna tries to re-invent herself, experimenting with different identities, navigating her sexuality, learning about who she is and who she wants to be.What I liked:1. Humor. Very very funny scenes that made me giggle like a madwoman.2. Very honest and frank look at a teenage girl and her sexuality.3. Poignant moments as Johanna some critical things about herself and the world.4. Funny characters5. Vivid settingThings to think about if you're considering reading this book:1. It's very open and frank about sex. If you don't want to read about, say, masturbation, fellatio, body functions or drug-taking, you'll be uncomfortable with many scenes in this book. Not a value judgment, just an observation.2. Ditto for the language. If slang and cursewords freak you out, you're going to be very freaked out reading this book.3.

"This is one of those books that challenges me to write a fair review. Part of the problem is that the book just wasn't a good fit for me, apart from any issues with the quality of the writing. The book has been described in terms of the main character, a Mississippi woman named Mary Byrd, getting a phone call out of the blue telling her that her younger brother's 30-year-old murder case is being reopened. I assumed that the murder case would be the central focus of the book, either in terms of digging up old secrets or in terms of Mary Byrd finally putting to rest a very painful part of her past. And while the book does address the latter, it doesn't spend much time doing it. The bulk of the book is a kind of character study of Mary Byrd and some of the people around her.It also didn't help that I didn't particularly like Mary Byrd's character. Again, it's not a matter of the character not being well drawn, but rather I found the character herself to be irritating and shallow. The fact that the author can create a character that triggers an emotional response suggests a certain amount of talent in writing and characterization.However, in addition to my personal reaction to the book and character, there are some issues with the writing that I thought needed improvement:1. Needed a good edit. The book meanders to an incredibly degree, and is full of asides, explanations, descriptions and other minutiae that detract from the focus of the book and made me inclined to skip paragraphs and pages at a time. It's first writer syndrome, I think, being unable to bear cutting any of your writing out, but as painful as it is to remove your writing, sometimes you have to ruthlessly edit out your precious words.2. Unlikeable characters. Leaving apart the question of Mary Byrd's personality (some will love, some will hate), none of the other characters in the book is particularly likeable and some who have potential aren't fleshed out enough to become real.3. Side plot lines become too distracting. Too much goes on this novel -- the shooting committed by Evagreen's daughter, the big storm, and the death of another minor character, for example, The main story, about Mary Byrd and her brother's murder, gets to feel like an afterthought. And the resolution of Stevie's murder, such as it is, feels rushed and forced.Sometimes I think publishers, in their quest to find a ""hook"" to market a book, do their authors a disservice by making a book seem like something it's not. ""Flying Shoes' isn't a mystery novel or a police procedural, and it isn't primarily a story of a woman coming to grips with her stepbrother's violent death. It's mainly a folksy, chatty character study of one woman, her family and friends. I think the author has real potential but I think readers would be better served by a clearer description of the book, and I think Howarth's writing might turn out better if she removed the real-life specter of her own brother's death from her work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCPRLLV286J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620403013#wasThisHelpful","R1LCPRLLV286J1","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't the type of book I'd pick up on my own, but I read a favorable review in a British paper. The title ""Department of Speculation"" is the cryptic return address that a husband and wife used as the return address when they wrote each other. Jenny Offill uses very brief but powerful vignettes (for lack of a better word) to portray the joys, pain, conflicts and dilemmas that modern marriage and parenthood can create. The book is not written like the typical novel: the characters don't get names (they are referred to as ""the wife"" and ""the philosopher,"" to give two examples) and the action is described in a more oblique way, as if someone was writing in their journal. It sounds weird but it's very well done and manages to pack quite an emotional punch. I read most of it in one sitting (it's short) and enjoyed it far more than I ever expected to. A really vivid example of how writing doesn't have to be long-winded or detailed to be moving and meaningful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9I49RGC3AQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350813#wasThisHelpful","RH9I49RGC3AQQ","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have long preferred Cascade for our dishwasher.

"There's no doubt that Tom Rachman is a terrific writer. He can create memorable, unique characters, can turn an amazing phrase, elicits emotion and has imagined a narrative spanning thirty-plus years. The book is, to summarize it most briefly, the story of Tooly Zylberberg, a 30-something American expat who has lived a pretty extraordinary life, traveling the world with different quirky characters, some of whom may or may not be her parents. The story is told in a somewhat disjointed way, jumping back and forth between decades; in an interview, Rachman said he wanted to anchor the story in three time periods immediately preceding monumental events (one is the collapse of the Soviet Union; one is the period preceding 9/11; he leaves the third oblique, but it's 2011). Tooly is looking back at her odd life, and trying to figure some things out about herself and where she comes from. The reader is kept in the dark about how various characters fit together and where Tooly fits among them until fairly far along in the book. Just as Tooly is trying to arrange the pieces of her life to make sense to her, the reader is trying to discern the patterns in Tooly's life. And in that regard, the novel rewards patience; if you get cranky because all is not clear in the first few chapters, you'll miss out on a lot. Rachman takes his time revealing important bits about Tooly's story, and it's not until nearly the end that the narrative coheres (at least for me). That being said, I think Rachman could work on better integrating Toolie's story sooner on and I think in seeking to create a bigger book with a bigger aim, he ends up flailing a bit. (The Imperfectionists, in contrast, is much more tightly constructed, snappier, with a wry tone that is missing much of the time here.) I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more of Rachman's work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YU7RDVXMNCM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679643656#wasThisHelpful","R2YU7RDVXMNCM9","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the reams of mystery novels published each year, finding a unique story, one that goes beyond the genre, isn't easy. Emma Healey's first book does so beautifully -- and poignantly. The lead character and narrator is an elderly woman with Alzheimer's (or a very similar form of dementia). Maud is in her 80s and as the book begins, she is just barely managing to stay in her home, with the help of caretakers and her loyal, loving yet often exasperated daughter Helen. The title refers to Maud's conviction that something has happened to her best friend Elizabeth, who lives nearby and is suddenly nowhere Maud can find her. At the same time, Elizabeth is a stand-in for Maud's sister Sukie, who went missing right after WW2 and whose whereabouts have never been determined. Healey does a great job of imagining how meaningful memories of the past get jumbled up with the mental detritus of the present, leaving Maud with a persistent feeling that someone she loves is missing and feeling driven to discover what happened.I have a dear friend whose wife has been suffering from Alzheimer's and so Healey's portrait of a woman who is gradually losing her memory, particularly for things in the present, moved me deeply, as I recognized many of the emotions and experiences my friends have been going through. Healey manages to show how baffling it must be to honestly not remember things and then be faced with consequences that, while they make sense to those around, don't make sense at all to you. She shows how Maud's hold on the present starts to give way to her memories of the past, and experiencing Maud's mental deterioration through her narration of the book is heartbreaking. Kudos to Healey for taking what must be very painful memories of her own grandmothers and creating Maud's character, helping to illuminate the terrible toll that dementia takes on both patient and caregiver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF1AEVIXY881U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062309668#wasThisHelpful","RF1AEVIXY881U","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadn't read any of Garth Stein's previous work, so I had no preconceived notions about ""A Sudden Light."" I wasn't prepared to be so moved by the novel -- it grabbed me, especially toward the end, and I stayed up late one night because I had to finish it. The narrator is Trevor Riddell, who is looking back at the summer he spent with his father, visiting the family home outside Seattle. It turns out that Trevor's great-grandfather was a lumber baron, who made a fortune clearcutting vast swathes of land in the US. Trevor's dad has returned to the family homestead to see his sister Serena and his father Sam; Trevor's parents are on the verge of divorce, and everyone hopes that time apart will help them reconcile. Trevor's grandfather suffers from increasing dementia, and Trevor's father wants to get a power of attorney so he can sell the land that the family home is on.""A Sudden Light"" is probably best read without knowing much more than that going in. It's a story, of course, about a boy's coming of age; about dysfunctional families and how they still cast long shadows over even adult children; it's a ghost story; it's about solving family mysteries; it's a story about what it means to be part of a family; it's a story about keeping promises and having faith (in the general sense, not in a specific religious sense). The characters are offbeat but believable and the setting is fascinating. The story really sucks you in, at times surprises you, and frequently touches you. Reading this book was an unexpected pleasure and I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35960CQVJSSCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439187037#wasThisHelpful","R35960CQVJSSCI","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""Brilliance,"" Marcus Sakey created an alternate reality for our world: what if, beginning in the 1980s, a small percentage of the population was born with remarkable talents or intellect? what if those individuals, called ""brilliants,"" used their abilities in ways that freaked out the rest of the population? how tolerant would American society be of this minority of savants? ""Brilliance"" explores how exceptional talents in the hands of a small percentage of the population could create a world where the ""normal"" majority seeks to suppress and control the talents of brilliants, leading to a tiny faction of brilliants engaging in terrorism.""A Better World"" picks up where ""Brilliance"" left off, showing us a scary and on-the-brink-of-disaster world where abnormal terrorists have begun attacking supply trucks, causing shortages of food and other essential supplies in a few major US cities. I don't want to give any spoilers that will ruin the way Sakey plays out the story, but suffice it to say that not everything is what is seems. This is a fast-paced, well-written thriller with lots of action and plenty of plot twists. And it's impossible not to read the book and think about how America is dealing with similar issues with regard to Islamofascist terrorism -- and perhaps making some of the same mistakes that Sakey's fictional government makes in this book. You will need to read the first book in the series before you plunge into this one, though; the plot and characters build on what came before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MO731UDB65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477823948#wasThisHelpful","R9MO731UDB65","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katherine Howe is a descendant of a girl who survived the Salem Witch trials, and her fascination with her family history is evident in this book. She presents two parallel stories: that of Ann Putnam, one of the teenagers who accused her neighbors of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692-93; and that of Colleen Rowley, who attends a tony private girl's school in Danvers, near where the original witch trials took place, and where students start manifesting strange physical symptoms, seemingly out of nowhere. Two things about the book really stood out for me. First was the way in which Howe manages to get inside the head of Ann Putnam and show us how a young girl could be manipulated and pressured into making crazy accusations of sorcery. The other is how well she captures the pressures placed on adolescent girls today, particularly girls who are expected to get good grades and get into a top-notch college, while simulateneously being popular, looking attractive, and navigating the perilous physical/emotional changes of the teenage years. It's a quick read since the story moves so fast, and I recommend it not only for the YA audience at which it's directed, but also their parents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13VOMXKW7FYFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167773#wasThisHelpful","R13VOMXKW7FYFA","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed ""The Dark World."" The book was an easy and engaging read, sucking me right in to the high school world of Paige, a teenage girl living in New York City. Paige was hit by a car and when she recovered from a coma and near-death experience, she'd gained the unenviable ability to see and talk with ghosts. Chatting with a spirit in your high school's bathroom isn't going to endear you to your classmates, and Paige is marked as an outsider, a weirdo, crazy. One day she's given detention, where a terrifying demon attacks her. Her classmate Logan appears and helps Paige escape. Logan introduces Paige to the world of demons, demon-slayers, warlocks and the shadow world that exists alongside their world.You've got action and suspense, supernatural plot elements, interspecies romance (Paige is human while Logan is not) and a nice dash of humor in Shultz's writing. Yes, certain plot elements feel a little trite (girl falls in love with dishy guy who isn't human, dark powers have a reason to hunt down girl and boyfriend) but it works. Keep your expectations a little low and you'll enjoy this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129GUVTU3550M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211201#wasThisHelpful","R129GUVTU3550M","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently finished the first book in the series by D.A. Mishana, featuring Israeli detective Avi Avraham. The sequel is, I think, better than the debut, and bodes well for the further development of this interesting series.As the novel begins, Avi Avraham is returning to work after a long vacation from his job as a police inspector -- the vacation being part of Avi's attempt to get past the resolution of a difficult missing-persons case he finished (the subject of the first novel in this series, The Missing File).Because his squad is low on manpower, Avi is pulled right into the investigation of who left a fake bomb in a suitcase outside a day care center. Avi has to face head-on his own regrets and self-recrimination about the way his last case ended, while making sure he doesn't screw this one up. And this case quickly gets complicated. One suspect, arrested on the scene, is an ex-con who denies any connection with the fake bomb, so Avi must look for alternative suspects, and focuses on the owner of the day care center, who seems to be hiding something. Things aren't exactly as you might expect, and the novel builds to a suspenseful conclusion.I found the author's straightforward, almost deadpan style effective in telling this story, and I think the pacing of this book was much improved over the previous one. I'm looking forward to see where D.A. Mishani goes next with this detective and series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5HVUY41BJRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062195409#wasThisHelpful","R1H5HVUY41BJRV","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Deliverance of Evil"" won an Italian award for best Italian crime thriller and is the first in a projected trilogy featuring Michele Balistreri, an italian police inspector haunted by regret and guilt. The book begins in 1982, when Italy is in the finals of the World Cup. A young woman goes missing, but young Balistreri isn't convinced she's the victim of foul play; immature, selfish, more concerned with his poker game than her job, he brushes off her family's concern. A few days later her body is found, murdered. Suspicion hovers around a teenager who knew the victim, but after he is arrested, it turns out that he has an alibi. The story picks up in 2006, when Italy is again on the verge of winning the World Cup. Balistreri is older, somewhat wiser, still tortured by the possibility that he could have prevented the woman's murder or at least solved the crime. More murders with a similar MO occur, and issues of political corruption, immigration, and Italy's fragile relationship with the Catholic church come into play.Overall, I did enjoy this book and thought that the author shows a lot of promise. Pros: interesting backdrop of Italian politics and social history, some interesting characters, raises issues (like bias against immigrants) that are pertinent today, lots of twists in an unpredictable plot. Cons: too long (needed some editing and tightening up), plot gets too confusing and convoluted at times, some of the explanations for Balistreri's behavior isn't clear (for example, after many allusions to a key incident in his youth, we still don't know what was by the end of the book), some readers not familiar with modern Italian politics might not quite understand some of the nuances.If I could give it three and half stars, I would, but although there's room for improvement, still not a bad book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MD5K9I3XYNQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162365002X#wasThisHelpful","R3MD5K9I3XYNQM","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Oathbreaker"" is the follow-up to Martin Jensen's ""The King's Hounds."" Set in 11th century England, we see a brutal world where the UK is divided into smaller kingdoms; Vikings frequently invade from the north; and political tensions run high. The two ""detectives"" are Winston, a monk turned manuscript illustrator, and Halfdan, son of a former nobleman who has been dispossessed of his estate. Winston and Halfdan have the confidence of Knit Cnut (having solved a murder for him in the previous book) and he asks them to travel north to assess the political winds. While they are staying overnight at an abbey, a monk is murdered. Winston and Halfdan are asked to look into the crime.I enjoyed this book, in particular the historical backdrop of medieval England. It gives the murder mystery an interesting twist, working in the politics and culture of the various tribes, showing how human nature remains essentially the same even though society changes greatly. I did not feel that I'd missed out on anything by not having read the first book and would search out more in the series. Good translation (it's a Danish series). My biggest gripe for the publisher is to please use less microscopic type -- it was very difficult to read given its tiny size.

"Perhaps it's because I'm an attorney (granted, a non-practicing one who never did much criminal law) and perhaps I should know better than to opt for books that rely on a lot of legal wrangling for my entertainment, but I just couldn't get into this mystery/thriller by Alafair Burke. The plot is convoluted, and concerns a man serving life without parole who pled guilty to a murder (call it Murder A). He was also suspected but never charged with 5 additional murders (B, C, D, E, and F). After he has served some 18 years in prison, the novel opens with a new murder -- Murder G.The police get an anonymous letter about Murder G that tries to connect it to all the previous murders by referring to a detail about the crime that was never released to the public -- and was also present in some of the prior crimes. The police assign a ""fresh look"" pair of detectives to review the cases, in particular Murder A -- the one that is keeping the convict behind bars. Somehow a flashy criminal defense lawyer is able to leverage the reinvestigation into getting the convict released, based largely on the discovery that Victim F had unknown DNA under her fingernails. The book follows the two detectives who are reviewing the cases, on the one hand, and a young attorney who is working for the convicted man. The convicted man is released from prison practically instantaneously and the heat is on -- to figure out who killed which victims, whether more than one murderer is involved, and to try to stop the convicted man from killing again (maybe; maybe he's innocent).  Even this bare-bones description of the plot sounds preposterous to me.And did I mention that the young attorney is the half-sister of Victim F and therefore working to free the man that everyone else thinks killed her sister?  And one of the detectives reviewing the cases happens to be living with the assistant DA in charge of prosecuting the convicted man?By a third of the way in, the plot had already presented me with some essential information that I simply could not believe would ever happen:  1. a man who pled guilty and confessed to crime A gets let out due to evidence involving a completely different crime for which he was never charged or tried; 2. after one hearing at the state court level, he is released within hours -- no lengthy appeals, no federal court review, no paperwork -- boom -- he's out. And he isn't required to be monitored by any law enforcement agency. 3. the DA is in a relationship with one of the detectives reinvestigating the case. 4. one of the convicts lawyers is the half-sister of one of his suspected victims.The book isn't badly written, although previous books I've read by Burke were better. I found it impossible to get engrossed in the story and suspend my disbelief when I was constantly thinking how unlikely the happenings of the book were in real life. I know that creative license is often taken to make books more interesting or add conflict, but this was just. too. much.Hard-core fans of Burke and those who are able to let their imaginations run a bit wilder than apparently I can may enjoy this book, which is one of a series of mysteries involving the police detectives Hatcher & Rogan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YWY9YTJTJUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062208381#wasThisHelpful","R39YWY9YTJTJUN","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy police procedurals and have been fascinated by crime novels set in countries other than the US -- so discovering a new Scandinavian detective novel is always fun. In ""The Viper,"" detectives in a remote part of Sweden are called to investigate the murder of a man and a woman. The bodies are found in the home of a wealthy corporate consultant named Arvid Traneus. Turns out that Traneus just returned to Sweden after a lengthy stay working in Tokyo. The detectives must first identify the bodies (is it Traneus? or some other man?), and then begins the sometimes-tedious process of sorting through physical evidence, interviewing witnesses and following up leads to try to figure out who killed the victims. This is a classic police procedural told mainly from the perspective of the detectives working the case, supplemented by vignettes from the lives of those involved.If I could, I'd give this one three and a half stars. I enjoyed reading it, and it was competently-written, with believable characters, an interesting backdrop (life in a rural part of Sweden) and lots of policework. However, it never really drew me in and engaged me the way that many other police procedurals have. It seemed longer than it was, and I found the shifts in time (particularly the ones in which we go back and forth from the middle of the investigation to the end) jarring.If you are a hardcore fan of police procedurals, or really fascinated by Scandinavian crime novels, you'll want to give this one a go, but more casual readers will want to explore the real stars of the genre (Henning Mankell, Jo Nesbo, or Karin Fossum) first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Z5S9V2ZJ0K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312642326#wasThisHelpful","R12Z5S9V2ZJ0K7","AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good Bluetooth stereo receiver with a surprisingly long range. It is similar to others I've used except for two things, one good and one less good:PRO: The noise cancelling unit is nice if you take a lot of calls while driving, and it also lets you connect to a cassette to stereo adapter if your vehicle does not have a stereo input jack.CON: No magnetic base so you're forced to use the sticker mount. The stickers don't hold up well and get messy, so I prefer not to use them.Overall this is a decent product. I'm not a huge fan of this design in general, however, which is not a knock on this particular item. Like others it has long wires that add to the clutter of your vehicle. I don't know why they don't make the base a dongle that simply plugs into a stereo input jack and hangs there.

"Kevin Barnes has made a livelihood out of playing dress up on of Montreal albums; from a peaceof montreal and love paisley troubadour, to a pop-centric studio loner, to a manic depressant, anxiety-ridden groove maker, to a transvestite hooker. Barnes has taken character-driven songwriting to new heights. The thing is, I think each ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù Barnes has taken on have all been elements of himself. Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer seemed to be the most biographical he‚Äôd gotten on any album up to that point, using that record as a jumping off point into two albums(Skeletal Lamping and False Priest) where he got lost in those record‚Äôs worlds. In 2013 with the release of Lousy With Sylvianbriar, Barnes opened the studio doors to friends and recorded as a real band, live in the studio directly to tape. The result was a buzzing, breathing record filled with late 60s nostalgia by way of the Stones and Bob Dylan. Now, with Aureate Gloom Kevin Barnes stuck with that living, breathing formula in the studio and traded in the late 60s nostalgia for mid-70s New York grime. The Stones and Dylan have been shelved for Television‚Äôs beatnik post-punk and Talking Heads‚Äô jitters. of Montreal haven‚Äôt sounded this vital and in-the-moment since 2007.‚ÄúBassem Sabry‚Äù is all funk and disco skronk, and it puts us in Barnes‚Äô headspace right away. It sounds like Talking Heads, had they gone full-on disco. The song shifts as Barnes sings ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never follow, no kind of master‚Äôs voice‚Äù with a melancholy lean before the song refrain ‚ÄúI believe in witches, I believe in you‚Äù fades us out. It‚Äôs a great opening track, and one that seems to encompass everything that‚Äôs great about a Kevin Barnes song. ‚ÄúLast Rites At The Jane Hotel‚Äù is filled with all kinds of gnarly attitude and jagged regret. ‚ÄúEmpyrean Abattoir‚Äù starts out like an IRS-era R.E.M., all tight high hat and driving bass before the song gets mildly frantic and psychedelic in the chorus. ‚ÄúAluminum Crown‚Äù floats on a cloud of disenchantment as Barnes sings ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been cursed by troubled dreams, I‚Äôve been hurt by troubled dreams‚Äù, before the song kicks in jangly new wave mode half way through. ‚ÄúVirgilian Lots‚Äù is classic of Montreal, with genteel backing vocals and some classic Barnes vernacular.I think the most striking thing about Aureate Gloom is how good this band sounds. They sound like a cohesive, rock ‚Äòn roll machine willing to perform whatever pops into Kevin Barnes‚Äô head and with great ease and vigor. Barnes did the studio loner thing for quite a few years, and with much success. Hell, I will throw fisiticuffs with anyone that says anything bad about Skeletal Lamping as I feel it‚Äôs a genius and masterful mess. But by 2011 I think the formula for of Montreal needed some tinkering. Adding living, breathing cohorts to the mix to help Barnes create his aural mazes and melody-painted panic attacks was just what this band needed. ‚ÄúEstocadas‚Äù, for my money, is the greatest example of that. It‚Äôs rock swagger, psychedelic blues, and overall melancholy bridge epitomizes everything Barnes is capable of. He shows the verbiage he‚Äôs known for is no match for heart-on-sleeve pain and pissed-on aspirations. ‚ÄúEstocadas‚Äù is baroque and gritty and damn near perfect.If you‚Äôve never been a fan of of Montreal, I‚Äôm not sure the tide will turn with Aureate Gloom. It‚Äôs very much an of Montreal record; which is to say it‚Äôs still fussy, labyrinthine, and sometimes a hard pill to choke down. Thing is, those exact things are what make of Montreal fans come back for more. Kevin Barnes creates musical tapestries that you can get lost in. He creates worlds that look familiar and strangely perverse at all once. You commit to an of Montreal album. You‚Äôre rewarded with raw art and pained emotion. Aureate Gloom is of Montreal at their grittiest and gnarliest yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXD6EIKGF1AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBLW7L6#wasThisHelpful","RAXD6EIKGF1AO","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot can be said for a good boogie. Take that boogie, mix in some psychedelics and some robotic rhythms and what you have some something kinda fun and menacing. Moon Duo's Eric ""Ripley"" Johnson likes music you feel in your bones and in the chattering of your teeth. Along with band mate and keyboardist Sanae Yamada, Johnson makes hypnotic tomes that aren't about storytelling as they are about creating some great grooves and beats to soundtrack the story. They've been making music as Moon Duo since 2009 and with each release they seem to expand their musical ideas a little more. They've begun to sound less like a Johnson's other band Wooden Shjips and more like a beefed-up, psychedelic B-52s. Last year's Live at Ravenna showed that live Moon Duo were a force to be reckoned with, displaying a power with a live drummer backing them up. Shadows of the Sun take that concept to the studio and the result is a tasty, brawny chunk of psych groove music that makes Wooden Shjips all the more insignificant.Insignificant is a strong word. I mean, every record Johnson's main gig put out up to 2011s West were pretty stellar. Quaalude-hazy riffs ground down to nubs, with desert death trip rhythms that crawled along for as long as the band stayed aware that they were still playing instruments. It was 60s psychedelic biker music that owed as much to Black Sabbath and Kenneth Anger's Lucifer Rising, as it did to LSD and that salty Bay Area air. Unfortunately their last effort, 2013s Back To Land, just felt exhausted and tired. Moon Duo seemed to be an outlet for Johnson to speed up the riffs and get those dirty hippies dancing. On Shadows of the Sun Johnson and Yamada have made their most clear-eyed record to date. The song ""Zero"" on another planet, lets call it Bizarro Earth, would have been a radio hit. It's equal parts Dire Straits, B-52s, and dark wave's incessant oppression. It feels like a pop hit in the catacombs of Paris. Then it's followed by the mozy good feelings of ""In A Cloud"". You can almost see them playing amongst towering cirrus clouds as a storm raged below them. Opening track ""Wilding"" and ""Night Beat"" come out of the speakers as a declaration of groove. They provide the greatest argument for Moon Duo to be a three-piece as opposed to a literal duo. There's still drum programming, but when drummer John Jeffrey is dispatched the robotic grooves have a decidedly human heart beat at the center.It's not so much a change of flavor on Shadows of the Sun as it is a change up of the spices that go to make that hypnotic, druggy flavor. Eric ""Ripley"" Johnson and Sanae Yamada are still creating great grooves and loping riffs that offer many zoning out possibilities. This time though, the android beats and looping keyboards feel more flesh and bone and less circuits and wires.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFN01SR72V66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHRP3G6#wasThisHelpful","R1QFN01SR72V66","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dodos have been doing their thing now for a few years. It seems like we've gone from theirPRC-284LP-COVERART_HIres 2008 album Visiter to their new album Individ in the blink of an eye. I know that's not the case, as Meric Long and Logan Kroeber have put out some truly great music in the years that followed that defining 2008 release. Time To Die, No Color, and their last record Carrier all seemed to add, expand, and build upon the formula they'd patented and created with on Visiter. What was that formula? Frantic, hyper beats mixed with acoustic strums and rhythms equally frantic in jangly desperation, all topped with Long's playful and youthful vocal delivery. Yelps and barks peppered the tracks as if coming from the bottom of an endless well. All of this came together to create the folk equivalent of a punk and youth-fed emotional exorcism. You got the feeling that Long and Kroeber were just as earnest and heartfelt as they were jaded and pissed off. That combination made listening to the Dodos all the more fun and palpable.Over the years, with every new record the Dodos sounded a little more mature and earthbound. A little more weighted down by the everyday slag. That feeling came to a head with 2013s Carrier. It was a record steeped in laments on life, death, and the overwhelming ""why?"" It was never maudlin, and it still retained some of that youthful and swift movement in the rhythm department; it was, however, weighted in emotional intricacies not fully explored until that point. Only a year and a half later we have the excellent Individ. Recorded at the same time as Carrier, you get the feeling they are two bookends to one explosive writing session. You also get the feeling that Individ is more of ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" part of that writing session. It also feels like a full circle kind of album. They've taken everything they've learned since 2008 and that knowledge culminates on this album. If this were to be the final Dodos record, we could be happy and content knowing that they gave us the best they had to offer.But let's hope that's not the case.The songs on Individ retain much of the clear-eyed honesty that filled Carrier, yet you get the feeling the songs on this new album are of the ""next morning"" variety. ""Precipitation"" has distant guitar swells, Kroeber's amazing tom work, and that guitar jangle Long has made his bread and butter. The clouds have cleared in this song, and while there may be more storms to deal with things seem better. ""The Tide"" harkens back to Visiter and that album's excellent ""Red and Purple"". All manic energy kept in control with Long's calm vocal delivery. ""Bubble"" sounds a bit reminiscent of Time To Die's more contemplative moments, albeit with the weight of a few years of living under their belts. Meric Long has learned how to use electric guitar very well since the early days. He creates heaviness in mood, not volume so much. There's a real existential weightiness to the songs thanks to Long's guitar technique. ""Competition"" is the lead single and it's a great way to introduce Individ to folks. It's a nice culmination of what you have to look forward to on this album.The Dodos have made an album that shows the years they've lived, the friends they've gained and lost, and hopefully what's in store for the future of the band. From ""Darkness"" and it's gentle swells and lilting vocals, to ""Retriever"" and it's fuzzed-out manic persistence, to the epic closer ""Pattern/Shadow"", Meric Long and Logan Kroeber have made an album filled with light and life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7GYZBKWGSO25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6PE0PS#wasThisHelpful","R7GYZBKWGSO25","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can see where some fans of Title Fight prior to their new record Hyperview might feel a little distraught or confused. Floral Green was this one long bloody scream of anguish sountracked with a wall of drums and guitars that was reminiscent of Motion City Soundtrack of steroids. Vocals front and center, it was an emotional exorcism put on record. It was something you could mosh to and cry to, even at the same time. With Hyperview, Title Fight have given into their previously mild flirtations with more of a dreamy, distant sound. There are some missteps here and there, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and let your favorite band grow a little.""Murder Your Memory"" is the first clue that your favorite punk band from Pennsylvania have decided to change things up. The tempo has been downgraded to almost a distant shuffle. Jamie Rhoden's vocals barely rise above a whisper, giving the song a maudlin feel that is quite striking when you think of Floral Green's opener ""Numb, But I Still Feel It"". ""Chlorine"" picks up a bit, sounding a bit like Title Fight's Pennsylvania brethren Nothing. ""Hypernight"" sounds like a cross between Whirr and Sunny Day Real Estate, with Rhoden putting his voice back in the screaming levels.Here's the thing, I hear ""shoegaze"" thrown around quite a bit when folks are talking about Hyperview. Sorry ,but this is not a shoegaze album. Shoegaze, besides being used way too much to describe some pretty but bland albums, is something far different than Title Fight. It's far druggier, gnarlier, and dangerous. The only thing Title Fight's album has in common with any real shoegaze record is that the vocals are mixed into the music, not above it to be the central focus. No, Hyperview has far more in common with the Captured Tracks roster. Bands like Wild Nothing, Beach Fossils, and Diiv seem to have offered up some DNA strands for Title Fight to meld with their own sound. ""Your Pain Is Mine Now"" is dreamy and pleasant with a hint of sadness. Chords ring slightly dissonant giving the song an eerie Motels vibe. ""Rose of Sharon"" has an early 90s feel. Portland and Seattle in all their heroin glory days. The last half of the album teeter totters between blissful lamenting and hard edged indifference.I think Title Fight seem to be wanting to expand their sound from emotional sanctification and barrel-chested punk aggression to something more subtle and restrained. With changes like that to ones art you end up pissing off some fans and they call you a sell-out. To those fans I say growing pains can hurt, but you gotta let it happen. Hyperview, to some, will be a painful growing spurt. But to the more open-minded listener they may find things are really starting to fit nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKALRLPF2UUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG6IEFK#wasThisHelpful","RXKALRLPF2UUG","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôve never really been much into live albums. For some reason they just don‚Äôt do much for me. TheyFlamingo never seem to truly capture the magic of that moment. You know the moment I‚Äôm referring to. It‚Äôs that moment when you‚Äôre in a sweaty room or overcrowded theater and as sweat is dripping down your back and your legs feel like they‚Äôre going to buckle you hear the opening notes of a song and things click. The dude to the right of you feels it, and that chick standing in front of you feels it, too. The guy behind you is screaming his head off so you know he‚Äôs feeling it. It‚Äôs that moment when the band on stage hit the opening notes of the battle cry. The tune that takes a room full of sweaty strangers and turns them into one beautiful creature that sings along to every word. Sometimes in tune, sometimes not. It doesn‚Äôt matter. A ‚Äúthing‚Äù occurred in the lives of both those in attendance and those strumming the chords and beating the beats. A song turns bystanders into a rock ‚Äòn roll Voltron.It‚Äôs a beautiful feeling, man.It‚Äôs happened to me a few times at shows. One that sticks out is Indianapolis back in the summer of 2008. Dr. Dog was playing at Radio Radio and my wife and I headed down with one of our best friends to see them. The show was stellar. The room small and intimate, and by the time we‚Äôd gotten half way through Dr. Dog‚Äôs set the room was boiling, man. It was like a Turkish bathhouse. I could see steam coming off my friend. My shirt was wet as if I‚Äôd jumped into a pool. As the sweat rolled down the side of my face the band went into ‚ÄúThe Bat, The Rabbit, & The Reindeer‚Äù and everyone roared. The song built and built and the crowd buzzed and frenzied. Dr. Dog jumped in unison on Radio Radio‚Äôs small stage and it looked as if the band was going to fall through the floor. Amps, keyboards, drums, and PAs jerked inward with every manic jump the band made, yet nothing crashed. The song built and built and we jumped along with every downbeat. It was a beautiful feeling. It was magic that sprayed off ourselves along with sweat(and in one case vomit.)Those are the moments at a show where the band locks in with the crowd. With the fans. It‚Äôs a communal experience. You can‚Äôt get that experience sitting on your couch drinking a beer listening to a live album. Try as you might, that magic isn‚Äôt canned. It‚Äôs not pressed on the vinyl. There may be other magic in those grooves, but strangers‚Äô blood, sweat, and tears sadly are not. The magic of a live show is in that room with the band, fellow fans, and the tingle you get at the base of your spine when those opening notes are hit and your wife squeals like a banshee in your ear and begins to jump wildly. That‚Äôs the magic of live music.Still, having said all that there are a few exceptions to my live album shunning. Cheap Trick at Budokan, Rush All The World‚Äôs A Stage, Television Live at the Old Waldorf, and Wilco Kicking Television: Live In Chicago, and even Tame Impala‚Äôs Live Versions do a nice job of bottling some of that live mojo magic. Dr. Dog‚Äôs Live At At Flamingo Hotel can be added to that list. The 19-song set is a great cross section of the band‚Äôs decade of music making and a testament to Dr. Dog‚Äôs stage prowess and skill at holding a crowd in complete awe.Is it as good as actually seeing them live? No, but it‚Äôs the next best thing. And when ‚ÄúThe Bat, The Rabbit, & The Reindeer‚Äù came on it was all I could do to not jump around like a sweaty idiot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXJ53SCZHI2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG15M5U#wasThisHelpful","R2JXJ53SCZHI2E","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Carpenter colored at least two generations' dreams in burnt fall hues. Faded browns,sbr123-johncarpenter-lostthemes-1400_1024x1024 oranges, yellows, and reds, topped with gray, overcast skies bled into our psyche and made us re-imagine Halloween in a whole new way. In a way where the fear we felt walking down the sidewalk in our Darth Vader costume holding a grocery bag full of Hershey and Nestle confections wasn't something made up in our own minds and imaginations. It was something very real. The Bogeyman wasn't just contained in a campfire ghost story; the Bogeyman was lurking just up the street ahead waiting for you. Carpenter defined a genre of horror and indie films with 1978s Halloween. From there he made films that would go on to inspire fans and fledgling filmmakers alike for years to come. Part of the appeal of his films, besides the very distinctive look(color, lighting, cinematography) were the scores he created to help push the story along. He used modern technology with classic touches to make haunted, eerie, and pulsating soundtracks. The Prophet 5 and 10 synths were used by Carpenter to create classic scores for Assault On Precinct 13, Halloween I,II,and III, The Fog, Christine, and The Prince of Darkness just to name a few.For a certain portion of the music-loving population these scores Carpenter created(in the case of Halloween along with Alan Howarth) are as important as the films themselves. They define an era of horror film where auteurs like John Carpenter made what to the common eye appeared to be ""cheap thrills"" kind of horror. But looked at a little deeper there was more going on. These scores act as a time machine of sorts to back to those days. Before ""the gorier the better"" adage took hold. Much like those films, the scores were classics. Lost Themes is John Carpenter's debut standalone album of instrumental tracks. Music for films never made by Carpenter. It's a soundtrack to whatever your imagination can come up with. It's every bit as good as you'd think, with only a few moments where it staggers a bit.Lost Themes is filled with great, haunting moments. ""Vortex"" feels like an opening steadicam shot through neon lit city streets. The lights reflecting off puddles along the sidewalks as someone makes their way through an urban landscape dimly lit. ""Obsidian"" is a driving track that feels like a chase through the night. ""Fallen"" is melancholy and dream-like. ""Purgatory"" is menacing and mournful, while ""Night"" is arpeggiated menace. Every track is a single word title, and I think that works well for these songs.Carpenter, along with his son who helps his dad out on Lost Themes, creates dark moods and aural experiences with a singular precision. Some songs suffer from at times a dated sound here and there. ""Mystery"" moves along nicely until ""rock"" drums enter the picture and add an element of Trans-Siberian Orchestra to the proceedings which slows down the songs initial tension. ""Wraith"" gets bogged down a bit towards the end with a guitar part that seems to have been pulled from a Savatage song from 1987. ""Domain"" sounds more like Australia's The Night Terrors than John Carpenter, but these are just small issues. Nothing that bogs the album down too much.Bands like Sinoia Caves, The Night Terrors, and Night Flights have been making synth-heavy records over the last few years that borrow heavily from John Carpenter's scores and they do it well, without aping Carpenter too bad. More homage than anything else. But it's great to see and hear the ""Master of Horror"" himself putting out a standalone record of original music. Lost Themes is both a throwback to classic Carpenter soundscapes and a modern take on synth-driven music. He may not be making movies like he used to, but if this album is any indication, he's certainly not running short of creativity or artistic wealth. Not by a long shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDM3WJ5WLB64W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2XKBEU#wasThisHelpful","RDM3WJ5WLB64W","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listening to Alex Calder's Strange Dreams I had the strongest feeling of deja vu I've ever had. It was as if I'd heard the album before. Hell, it was as if I'd written about it in fact. But how could that be? How could I have written a review for an album I'd never heard before? It was like a, well, strange dream.But this feeling coming from Alex Calder isn't surprising. The guy is out there. Just, well, you just don't know if the guy is pulling your leg or if he's really just insane. But why would Captured Tracks put his albums out if he was just some crazy Canadian that played in a band with Mac Demarco once? I don't know. They wouldn't. There had to be something about Alex Calder besides five different Instagram accounts and his constant ""retiring from music"" and ""returning to music"" every couple months.I'm listening to Strange Dreams right now and I am remembering why I love this guy's music so much. His Time EP from 2013 was this compact little album filled with tension, woozy pop, and the feeling of a buzz gone horribly wrong. You go from sweet bliss to paranoia in seconds flat. Strange Dreams is his official album debut and it lives up to the promise of that EP and then some. It's still catchy as hell. But catchy in the way someone like Ariel Pink or Bradford Cox is, not like the Beatles or(insert pop artist here.) It's like the promise of a train wreck, but he never quite goes off the rails. It's filled with woozy enchantment, much like being doped up before getting a cavity filled at the dentist's office. The nitrous was left on a little too long and the voices are distant echoes as you gladly open wide for a drill.The songs? They're like a funhouse mirror version of pop from the 80s. But not the 80s you recall. A bizarro version of the 80s. A place where Deerhunter had the number one song in August of 1982. The Motels played the 1986 Superbowl Halftime Show. An 80s where Ariel Pink put together ""We Are The World"". Alex Calder's music is the alternative to the alternative. It's apparent he loves pop music. But pop music coming from the point-of-view of latchkey kids. It's stoned indifference. It's darkly lit humor and a WTF middle finger up to anything that is too fussed over. ""Retract"", ""Strange Dreams"", and ""Out of My Head"" sound like distant jangle. It's hard to discern the words Calder sings, but that's of little importance. The words are merely another instrument. His voice is reverbed-drenched and just audible enough. It's just another color splattered on the canvas, filthy canvas that it is. ""The Morning"" is distant rumble, synth, and Calder's voice floating above in a cloud of THC.Am I reading too much into this guy? Am I giving him too much credit? It's one thing to have a sense of humor about yourself and pull one over on folks. I get it. It's fun to do that kind of crap. But at some point people are going to start questioning your intent. Am I just a dope for liking Alex Calder? I guess it doesn't really matter. I like his Time Ep, and I really like Strange Dreams. I also like strange dreams. Like that one I had where I reviewed an Alex Calder album back in June of 2014 called Strange Dreams. Weird, man. Just weird.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26I0MM51JQKSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKXPCSM#wasThisHelpful","R26I0MM51JQKSK","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Newspaper Spoons"" opens like a distant canon firing into the abyss. An overblown kick drum beats like a death knell before Matt Flegel sings ""Writhing violence essentially without distortion, Wired silent, vanishing into the boredom"". It's a hell of a way to open a debut album, but that's just the kind of album Viet Cong is. With every turn your put through an aural wringer. Your mind is blown and your head feels like it's going to explode. Welcome to 2015, the year of Viet Cong.The band is one half of the former Calgary band Women. When that band broke up, bassist Matthew Flegel wanted to start a band with guitarist Scott Munro. They enlisted Women drummer Michael Wallace and guitarist Daniel Christiansen and Viet Cong was born. They released a cassette-only EP that was sold at gigs in 2012. That album showed a spry, post-punk informed band with darker tendencies. On Viet Cong they fully embrace the darkness and get down to some serious gothic tendencies. ""Pointless Experience"" stabs with siren-like guitars and Flegel's heavily-reverbed vocals. It's as if Interpol put the suits away and embraced the gutter. Lyrics sound like the prose of a post-apocalyptic survivor. Flegel sings ""Failed to keep the necessary papers for evacuation, Hideously synchronized with cold and cruel arithmetic"". Viet Cong don't do paint-by-numbers lyrics. It's poetic and dystopian. ""March Of Progress"" starts out with white noise, as if looking for signs of life on an old tube television. Pretty soon distorted drums come through the fuzz like war drums as wavering synths move back and forth as if stuck in a vacuum. Vocals come in beautifully, harmonies singing ""Lately there's a wound that needs some healing soon, Before the infection can set in."" Soon enough the song kicks into an almost new wave drum beat and the guitars become chime-y and have more of a post-punk jangle.You get the feeling through the darkness and shadowy entities that haunt this record that there's an element of healing going on here. It's like the aural version of prolonged exposure therapy. You keep going over the pain through each song until it loses the hurt. A song like ""Bunker Buster"" is all splintered guitar jabs and post-punk strut. It's like Mission of Burma in swagger mode. Munro and Christiansen are making some of the most interesting and intriguing guitar noise that I've heard in a very long time. ""Continental Shelf"" has elements of A Place To Bury Stranger's wall-of-guitar noise in the songs verses before becoming quite eerie and beautiful in the chorus. Lyrically it's doomed, tragic, and oddly moving. Flegel has a knack for doomed and romantic lyrics. Dream-like, dystopian, and darkly vague. He paints dark landscapes that you can occasionally catch something dimly lit hiding amongst the shadows. ""Continental Shelf"" is a massive song that gives you a world to get lost in, at your own risk of course. ""Silhouettes"" has the dark, bass-y pulse of Luis Vasquez' The Soft Moon with new wave synths hanging over the proceedings. It's a hell of a track. The album closes on the epic and mammoth dirge ""Death"". It's over 11 minutes of new wave, post-punk, and dark wave haze. It feels like this cycle of mourning and healing. The vocals fade and the song turns into this churning, swirling sea of noise and madness.Viet Cong feels vital and intense. It's blood spurting on the canvas. It's embracing the scars that come with the wounds of the past. Embracing the fact you survived and lived to tell about it. This album feels revolutionary. Viet Cong is pure, raw, bloody rock and roll at it's best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBSKB0VYQFKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHKK8K6#wasThisHelpful","R2MBSKB0VYQFKA","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be honest, the only reason I listened to this album was because of Kevin Parker. I think Kevin Parker is a musical genius and can do no wrong, so if he's cool with Mark Ronson I suppose I am as well. As far as albums go where there's tons of different artists playing puppet to Mr. Ronson's puppet master Uptown Special isn't too bad. But if you're here for something deep, meaningful, and precious go look elsewhere.So how does this work, anyways? Does Mark Ronson write these songs and bring in people he likes to sing on them? Does he arrange and let the singers write lyrics? I have no idea. Up until this album I thought Ronson was just some wunderkind producer. Amy Whinehouse's Back To Black was where my ears perked up to what Ronson was doing. I loved the retro sound he made. But looking back he's put out at least two other albums under his own name. Don't ask me what's on those, as I have no idea. Anyways, Uptown Special is 37 minutes of funkified pop and dance music with a couple excursions into territory that lifts the overall project into something other than radio hits.The songs? Well apparently ""Uptown Funk"" with Bruno Mars is a hit. It sounds like a hit. Mars is a hell of a singer with the whole package; dance moves, style, and the vocal chops to back it all up. It's a catchy tune that will surely steal the retro funk crown from Pharrell's ""Happy"". In a year grandmas and great aunts will be singing ""Uptown funk you up"" at wedding receptions across these great lands. You heard it here first.Elsewhere Stevie Wonder even makes an appearance. He plays his world famous harmonica and sings on ""Uptown's First Finale"" and his harp reappears for closer ""Crack in the Pearl, Pt. II"". ""Feel Right"" has rapper Mystical doing his best hip hop version of Joe Tex' ""I Gotcha"". It's a fun song that you'll have to turn down when listening to it on your work computer(I learned the hard way.) ""Crack In The Pearl"" is kinda atmospheric with some great vocals. ""In Case of Fire"" has some rock guitar going on with an almost Steely Dan smoothness to it.But to my ears the highlights on this album are the tracks that have Tame Impala's Kevin Parker on vocal duties. ""Summer Breaking"" has a 60s vibe to it with the fuzzy guitar, then when Parker's vocals come in it becomes this 70s soft rock slow burner that shouldn't work but does. ""Daffodils"" sounds as much like a Tame Impala song as it does a Ronson joint. Wiggy synths and an almost ""Billie Jean"" rhythm, it ebbs and flows with some serious stoned indifference. It has the vibe of Lonerism B-side ""Beverly Laurel"". This song alone is worth the price of admission. ""Leaving Los Feliz"" is a fun song with a great beat and another great vocal melody courtesy of Mr. Kevin Parker. A full-on collaboration LP between Ronson and Parker would be a cool thing to see and hear.Okay, so Uptown Special isn't going to change your world or blow your mind. It is, however, a fun and funky dance album filled with top notch production and a couple great rump shakin' tunes. Plus, Kevin Parker. Can't go wrong with that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QAR1TRYUWO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4EJVRO#wasThisHelpful","R33QAR1TRYUWO0","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know a whole lot about D'Angelo. Up until hearing his incredible new album Black Messiah with his band The Vanguard the most I knew about this soulful crooner was that video for ""Untitled(How Does It Feel)"" he put out back in 2000. You know the one. Don't lie, I know you do. Anyways, so just a couple of weeks ago he drops this new record. The album he'd been working on with ?uestlove for a couple years now. It's called Black Messiah and it's out of this world good. It's weird, funky, soulful, and deep. I think the record has been done a disservice by being released just a couple weeks before the new year, as it surely would've made best-of lists all over the place had it been put out either two months ago or waited until January to release. That's just my opinion. It doesn't matter really, cause when it's this good who cares?""Ain't That Easy"" opens the album on this funky stroll down some hot city street. There's hints of so many ghosts from the past, yet D'Angelo and The Vanguard make something altogether new and essential. You can hear a little bit of Sly and the Family Stone, Al Green, and Parliament in the mix of soulful melody and street funk. Then you get to something like ""1000 Deaths"" and everything changes. It sounds like The Reality of My Surroundings-era Fishbone, had they been channeling Berlin-era Bowie. It's this spaced-out mix of funk, soul, and neo-futuristic dread. It's crazy and wonderful.I'd read somewhere that D'Angelo wanted this album to be his version of the Beach Boys' Smile, and listening to this record that's exactly the vibe one gets. It's a concept album of sorts, but one that doesn't necessarily tell a continuous story. You don't have to take it all in one sitting to get what he's doing here(but I recommend you do, as it's a hell of a trip.) ""The Charade"" is not paint-by-numbers soul music. In fact, nothing on Black Messiah is paint-by-numbers. It's more like beautiful splashes of blues, reds, purples, yellows, and greens laid out on this canvas we call life. It's big, heavy, bluesy, and dense. It goes from the world on your shoulders to strutting and smiling down the street. ""Sugah Daddy"" makes you smile from the first to last notes. This is the kind of song Prince used to make. Or the kind of song you wish he'd make again. Thing is, Prince doesn't need to now because D'Angelo has us covered. The Vanguard is his backing band. I'm not sure who's in the band, but they are amazing. ""Till It's Done"" opens up like a Baths cut before the guitar comes in and goes into an almost Ohio Players-on-acid vibe. ""Betray My Heart"" has a scat-like rhythm that keeps the song at a nice pace. This is probably some of the best vocals on the record(and that says a lot.) Closing track ""Another Life"" sounds like the Delfonics in outer space with Ohio Players covering ""I Want To Be Free"". It's out there and pretty incredible.  D'Angelo lives up to his reputation as one of the best, soulful singers of my generation with just this song alone. This album, from start to finish, is just immense.Black Messiah is a welcome return of one of my generations premier artists and songwriters. What this record proves is that there's more than just some crooner with some amazing abs writing soulful songs. D'Angelo is an amazing artist and someone with a clear vision of what he wants to create. Black Messiah is fun, quirky, groovy, and a heady, soulful trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R478BVC46W5U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR7ZN16#wasThisHelpful","R478BVC46W5U3","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to be completely honest here, okay? I've never been much of a fan of this guy called Ty Segall. Yeah, I know this is a shocking revelation to the world at large, but I felt I needed to get that out in the open before I went any further with this review. I will say that I've always admired the guy and his rather prolific output. If he's not putting out something under his own name then he's putting something out with one of his West Coast garage/psych brethren. While everyone around me hailed Segall as the second coming of rock n' roll, I responded with a less than enthusiastic ""meh."" I bought last year's Sleeper and found it to be an earnest little record that didn't feel the need to hide behind piles of hiss and feedback(not that I have anything against hiss and feedback.) I think with me it's always been this feeling that Segall was hiding behind the noise instead of wielding it as one of his many weapons in his rock n' roll arsenal. Well, I am here to admit dear readers that I was dead wrong about the 26 year-old wunderkind from Orange County and his newest masterpiece, the double album Manipulator, is proof of just how wrong I was.Listening to albums like Melted, Goodbye Bread, and Twins you get the feeling Ty has listened to his fair share of late-60s psych, garage, and a healthy dose of Blue Cheer, Stooges, and Black Sabbath, so when you throw on Manipulator for the first time you're instantly thrown off by the cleaned up production and locked-in grooves. The needle in the red levels of ear bleeding volume are replaced with Hunky Dory-era Bowie glam. The acoustic guitar almost seems attached to the drums as each strum accents the snare on ""Tall Man Skinny Lady"". It has a ""Queen Bitch"" vibe with Segall sporting a hell of a falsetto. I have to say right here that the drums on this album sound incredible. The extra time Segall took to make this record shows wonderfully in the engineering. The drums and bass work together on this album like they never have previously. Manipulator doesn't lose any of Ty Segall's DIY-approach to album making, but there's a clarity here that's never been present before. At times it comes off as the Stooges making The White Album. ""The Singer"" starts out like an acoustic ballad and then morphs into a T. Rex strut. ""Mister Main"" and ""Green Belly"" sport some great rhythm as the drums and bass lock in together and never let up. There's still plenty of face-melting guitar, like on the blistering ""The Connection Man"" and the opening build-up of ""The Faker"" before it rolls through the speakers with a rock n' roll chug. And I dare you not to pump your fists to ""The Crawler"". It's like an unholy union of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath run through the Bay area speed metal scene. Face melting, man. Manipulator takes everything Segall has dabbled in previously and churns it out into this proto glam/psych/metal sound that's just about perfect.If Ty Segall hasn't already released his breakthrough album, I believe he just has with Manipulator. And as someone who never bought into the hype of Mr. Segall before, I'm here to say I'm buying now. I'm a believer in this Orange County wunderkind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286D6OV4B3AA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUIV2OK#wasThisHelpful","R286D6OV4B3AA8","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while you happen across an album that surprises you. Maybe it doesn't change your life or blow your mind, but it stops your brain from that constant run of streaming real-world problems. You momentarily just shut the cranial machine down for a half hour or so and allow yourself to enjoy some music. Ashrae Fax's Never Really Been Into It is one of those shutdown moments for me. For its 40 minute run time I forget about responsibilities, deadlines, school obligations, and what I need to pull out of the freezer to thaw out for dinner. For 40 minutes I can take a load off in my mind palace and listen to Renee Mendoza sing in her Elizabeth Fraser-meets-Siouxie Sioux otherworldly coo. It's a pretty nice place to be, my mind palace. Yep, there's a mini-fridge stocked with craft beer and plenty of black lights.Musically, North Carolina's Ashrae Fax sound like they hail from Leeds in 1984, not Greensboro in 2014. That's the beauty of this gothic pop band. The Synsonics-sounding drum beats and ethereal keys give the ears a taste of Cocteau Twins and Siouxie Sioux and the Banshees, with the black fingernails of Robert Smith. Having been immersing myself in the Cocteau Twins recently reissued Blue Bell Knoll, Never Really Been Into It is definitely giving me that vibe, with even a hint of This Mortal Coil. For those who worship at the alter of 4AD(like me), then Ashrae Fax have got your number. Besides Mendoza, the band also consists of Alex Chesney, Mike Soter, and Robert Parker. They all work together to create a dreamy, goth-coated pop melancholy that is made for getting lost into.""Dreamers Tied To Chairs"" is an exquisite piece of goth pop that'll make you long for 1984 and late night summer breezes as the needle skimmed over Treasure. What's nice about this album is that it's not in a hurry. These songs take their time getting to the end, giving you plenty of time to get lost in them. ""CHKN"" sounds like what would've happened if The Motels had been on 4AD. Guitars that chime like primo-era Cure, right before Smith's hair grew to Redwood heights and he still had some of those pop tendencies in him prior to getting so sad and angry. ""The Big Lie"" is more tense in its delivery, bringing to mind some contemporaries like The Soft Moon and Cold Cave, with Mendoza showing her fangs a bit. It's like Kate Bush getting all post-punk on us. ""You Make Me Question My Mind(in a thousand words about time)"" is a quirky pop song that has the feel of a bizarro-world number one hit, somewhere in the days of 'Alf' and ""it's morning in America again"", hidden in the middle of a 120 Minutes broadcast. ""Intexus"" takes the Elizabeth Fraser likeness to a whole new level. Close your eyes, you'd swear you were listening to some lost b-side to Garlands' ""Wax And Wane"". Comparisons abound, but only to give the uninitiated a reference point. You can't go wrong with a single song on Ashrae Fax's sophomore album. This is catnip for 80s kids and 120 Minutes dwellers.I really should go pull something out of the freezer for dinner, but I think I'll just sit on my comfortable couch inside my mind palace for another 40 minutes and spin Never Really Been Into It one more time. Then I'll get up. Promise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2SJAC780LNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI3ZPE4#wasThisHelpful","R3V2SJAC780LNB","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bear In Heaven make music that create both icy, blue moments of detachment and bright, technicolor sheets of emotion. Their debut album, Red Bloom of the Boom, was this collection of odd, industrial-esque dirges bordering on experimentation. They hinted at what was ahead. 2009s masterpiece Best Rest Forth Mouth kept some that darkness and translated it into a tribal, viseral mix of Suicide and Tangerine Dream with an industrial sheen that mingled desire, loneliness, and a doomed hopeless romantic. 2012s I Love You, It's Cool lost much of the band's dark, tribal punch for jagged synth lines and a dance vibe that while worked, lost a bit of the bite Bear In Heaven had honed previously. It's been over two years and Bear In Heaven have returned with what is a perfect mix of darkness and light. Time Is Over One Day Old is a sparser, leaner album than I Love You, It's Cool and has the vibe of earlier albums while still not getting into any heavy dirges. Bottom line: Bear In Heaven have honed in on their strengths and kept things simple.""Autumn"" opens the album on a robotic beat and a hard-driving bass line that carries this great tune into dark, desolate space. It has everything you've come to love about Bear In Heaven: strong, driving rhythm, icy synth, and Jon Philpot's distant, yet ghostly innocent voice carrying you along. This is a great way to start an album. ""Time Between"" rolls in and takes you back to 2009 all over again. It's reminiscent of Beast Rest Forth Mouth's ""You Do You"". The tribal drums and big, foreboding synths hang in the air as Phipot humanizes the scene with his vocals. If there was a DNA strand showing Bear In Heaven's sound this track would be it. ""If I Were To Lie"" has a bit of a shuffle to it, giving this song something unique in the Bear In Heaven canon. ""They Dream"" mixes both the dark and light quite nicely, bringing some of the second half of I Love You, It's Cool into the fold. The synths have more of an ambient feel to them, with some of those great rolling toms filling in the empty spots. But just as the song gets going it melts into this atmospheric, dream-like segment that lulls you into a quieter head space. It's a great moment. ""The Sun and the Moon and the Stars"" floats by on a cloud of early 80s Echo and the Bunnymen while ""Memory Heart"" gets dark with a prominent bass line and some tribal drums reminiscent of early Cure before the chorus opens enough to let just the slightest bit of light in. ""Dissolve The Wall"" is this great atmospheric track that glides right by your ears, once again with a great bass line and Philpot's vocals hanging in the background in a curtain of reverb, while ""You Don't Need The World"" is strangely uplifting. A perfect song to end a great album on.With Time Is Over One Day Old Bear In Heaven have found their way back to that magic they created on Beast Rest Forth Mouth, this time honing it and making the songs more compact and in a pop song structure. At times I feel some of these songs could've been even longer and more expansive, but that's just me being difficult. Bear In Heaven have made a great album that gets better with each listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZTIWNO7344Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6D20K4#wasThisHelpful","R22ZTIWNO7344Z","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you name your band The Bilinda Butchers a precedent is being set. There‚Äôs no him-hawing around. This San Francisco trio describes their band‚Äôs genre as ‚Äúsad pop‚Äù, and has this to say about their sound, ‚Äù the group writes songs that contrast idealistic nostalgia with romantic uncertainty and sorrow.‚Äù Well there you have it. I wouldn‚Äôt call their new album Heaven ‚Äúsad‚Äù, per say. I would call it melancholy and dreamy, with hints of ambient haze and maudlin regret. But hey, that‚Äôs just me.While naming your band The Bilinda Butchers is fun and all, I think a more accurate name would have been The Elizabeth Frasers. There‚Äôs definitely more of a Cocteau Twins sheen happening on Heaven, rather than the grinding, druggy, shoegaze sound of My Bloody Valentine. I guess The Bilinda Butchers has a better ring to it. ‚ÄúUme‚Äù opens the album with an ethereal vibe as Juri Nakashima speaks quietly in a dreamy voice before the synths come in and sleepy vocals hang over the proceedings. The song has the wooziness of a Wish-era Cure song and vocals that would fit on a Pains of Being Pure At Heart track quite nicely. ‚ÄúLess Than‚Äù shifts gears dramatically, starting out like ‚ÄúThat Thing You Do‚Äù with a Fountains of Wayne jaunty pop sway happening. From dream pop to indie garage pop rock in the blink of an eye. ‚ÄúOld Style Amami‚Äù shifts gears once again with birds chirping and a woman(presumably beautiful and unattainable) speaks sweet nothings as yet another stylistic shift occurs. A programmed beat pulses through the speakers as synths whoosh and float by your ears. It‚Äôs a mood piece that pushes gently into ‚ÄúShadow Beat‚Äù. Keeping in the spirit of ‚ÄúOld Style Amami‚Äù at first with a bright, white light ambience before getting loud and rocking like a mid-90s Billy Corgan aspiring to be a late-80s Kevin Shields. Despite indie rock aspirations this track is too polished and slick to be categorized as anything but pop. This might‚Äôve fit in nicely on The Cure‚Äôs Wild Mood Swings. ‚ÄúGolden House‚Äù sounds like Wild Nothing on a digital synth binge with some great female vocals, while ‚ÄúThe Lover‚Äôs Suicide‚Äù sounds more down-to-earth with its guitar/bass/drums forwardness and ‚ÄúBoys Don‚Äôt Cry‚Äù-like drum beat. Throughout Heaven The Bilinda Butchers do a nice job of mixing dream pop, ambient whisps, and early 80s alternative rock in order to give a well-rounded listening experience. ‚ÄúTanka‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdo Method‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe River Sumida‚Äù help to make this album more than just a tribute to a genre, and ‚ÄúHeaven Holds A Place‚Äù feels like a 80s dance party on a purple cloud in some other dimension all the while sounding exhilarating and lamenting all at once.Though their name could work to pigeonhole the band as a whole, at times I can indeed hear the resemblance in the dreamy waves of purple noise that wafts from the speakers. To my ears there‚Äôs a lot more going on than just a tribute to a beautiful Irish chanteuse named Bilinda Butcher. But if you‚Äôre going to name your band after someone, it might as well be Bilinda Butcher. Or Elizabeth Fraser.Hey, it‚Äôs an option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HYGZ6M8Q8BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L03JGIS#wasThisHelpful","R20HYGZ6M8Q8BH","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever wondered what the Foo Fighters might sound like if they were fronted by Neko Case? No? Well then you can be excused. For the rest of you cue up Honeyblood‚Äôs self-titled album and check out opening track ‚ÄúFall Forever‚Äù and you‚Äôll find out. It‚Äôs as if that blonde guy was kicked off the drum throne and Dave Grohl took his rightful place back behind the kit as The New Pornographers chanteuse took over mic duties. It‚Äôs a stunning sound, really. Of course ‚ÄúFall Forever‚Äù isn‚Äôt the Foo Fighters or Neko Case, it‚Äôs Honeyblood and you won‚Äôt be forgetting that name anytime soon.Stina Marie Claire‚Äôs vocals possess a power that harken back to the glory days of the late-80s and early 90s when bands like Throwing Muses, The Breeders, and Blake Babies were making their presence known in the world of dude-dominated alternative music. Besides vocal duty Stina also plays guitar with as much force and machismo as any flannel-clad dude did back in Aberdeen or Seattle. This Scottish two-piece band, which also consists of Shona McVicar on drums are making a sound that guys like Gil Norton, Butch Vig, and Steve Albini produced back when President Clinton had just been sworn in. Besides ‚ÄúFall Forever‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuper Rat‚Äù seethes as Stina sings ‚ÄúYou are the smartest rat in the sewer,‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúI will hate you forever‚Äù as the song buzzes and hums like classic Pixies. ‚Äú(I‚Äôd Rather Be) Anywhere But Here‚Äù starts up like Concrete Blonde covering ‚ÄúLithium‚Äù, while ‚ÄúBud‚Äù has a Grant Lee Buffalo vibe with more of that Neko Case vocal phrasing. This is classic early 90s alternative. Honeyblood are tapping into a musical vein that has sorely been left to shrivel and fade. That space between the over indulgence of the 80s and the anti-establishment 90s indie music; that place in alternative music where a band could still sound good without losing street cred for doing so. ‚ÄúChoker‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Spare Key‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNo Spare Key‚Äù all grind and slither with the spirit of underground rock and the vibe classic 120 Minutes. Closing track ‚ÄúBraidburn Valley‚Äù sounds like a big, sweeping Mazzy Star track with a hint of Straitjacket Fits. Melancholy and angry all at once.So we may not have Neco Case fronting the Foos, and I suppose that‚Äôs just kind of weird when you think about it. But Honeyblood have given us one hell of a debut record. For those 80s and 90s kids that remember Alternative Nation, 120 Minutes, and being exiled in a place called Guyville.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q17KS7N30HLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXNTMNG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q17KS7N30HLC","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"United Waters‚Äô Sunburner is the sound of a hot apartment in July. With the air conditioner on the fritz the windows are wide open in the blazing afternoon and the sound of the neighborhood seeps in like the humid belches of heat that consume you. In the distance a guy cranks his stereo and blares some unrecognizable industrial album; the kid down the hall spends a half hour plucking an out-of-tune electric guitar, while a couple blocks away you can hear city workers breaking up a sidewalk. You can barely make it out, but someone is definitely playing a drumset, out of time of course and in intermittent slaps, pats, and tats. All of these noises are alarming at first. Painful even in the heat as you try to find some semblance of solitude amidst the cacophony of aural chaos. But after awhile all of these noises begin to mesh. They blend into this pharmaceutical, hypnotic sound soup. Underneath all of the noise you hear a low, monotone voice speaking to you, soothing you. What‚Äôs it saying? You can‚Äôt tell, but that‚Äôs okay. Pretty soon the city squall becomes this muffled, warbly pop song. A score to a sticky, sun and sweat-drenched afternoon. An industrial lullaby played in the key of nothing in-particular.I recently came across United Waters‚Äô Sunburner and I was a bit perplexed. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to make of it. Is it some avante garde take on noise rock? A codeine-laced, post-surgical numbed pop? I ran out of quirky, clever adjective-filled sentences to describe it. Pitchfork writer Marc Masters wrote this about Sunburner:Yet every inch of Sunburner is muffled and drenched as if it‚Äôs wearing a sweater in 100-degree weather; at times, it resembles a Joy Division record played under a stack of mattresses.I felt this was a great description but not one that would entice me to seek out United Waters‚Äô Sunburner at any point in the near future. I listened as opening track ‚ÄúBlue Weaver‚Äù played and to my ears it sounded like some beat up, warped tape copy of a lost Morphine song. With its simple guitar riff and what sounds like a distant kick drum playing, followed by singer Brian Sullivan‚Äôs moan/vocal it all sounded fairly common. Then this warped, mutant noise comes up from the depths and turns the song into something else. Darker and more sinister. ‚ÄúTurn On Your Century‚Äù beats and booms along like a band playing some nondescript song in a room three doors down. ‚ÄúSunburner‚Äù indeed sounds like the echoes of Joy Division running through their set list in a grimy Manchester garage as Leonard Cohen reads lyrics into a third rate microphone. ‚ÄúOur Beat‚Äù sounds like The Motels playing in an ether haze.The whole albums chugs along song after song with a disjointed rhythm and a rusty, industrial darkness. Like something that would be playing in the background of a David Lynch film, or a black and white German expressionistic short film. You start out thinking why you‚Äôre listening to this noise, but by the end you‚Äôre hitting play again. And again. It‚Äôs a hypnotic listening experience. You won‚Äôt be putting this album on to entertain the family or for a party jam. But much like Body/Head‚Äôs Coming Apart, it‚Äôs a visceral listening experience that affects you. You may even find a place to curl up and hide inside it for a bit. That‚Äôs not a bad thing.7.9 out of 10","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IC2C2UJJYBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6AWV9M#wasThisHelpful","R36IC2C2UJJYBH","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't start listening to Corrosion of Conformity till 1994. It was the next phase in their sound. Before the album Deliverance they were a hardcore punk band. They had street cred and lots of hardcore punk fans. But Deliverance saw the band head in more of a dirge-filled, Sabbath-oozing direction. Pepper Keenan as lead vocalist the band embarked on a journey to take over alternative music one song at a time. Wiseblood was just as good as Deliverance, if not better, and they continued to mix and match doom and gloom metal with a punk attitude until 2001s America's Volume Dealer. That album bordered on southern rock and made me want to forget the name Corrosion of Conformity. They attempted to redeem themselves with In The Arms of God before taking a hiatus till 2010. Their self-titled was a return to their hardcore days with the original trio finding that Animosity-era magic. With IX they continue the streak and add in some of that doom and gloom magic along with some classic thrash. This is Corrosion of Conformity in classic form. Look out, you little whippersnappers.""Brand New Sleep"" is a sludge-filled dirge, with a penchant for Sleep-filled doom and a dusting of 70s dizziness in those phaser pedals. It's a classic, bluesy doom song that opens the album on the right note. ""Elphyn"" brings Sabbath into the fold opening with the distant sound of thunder before blasting into a ""Children of the Grave"" hustle in the rhythm. Woody Weatherman's guitar tone is a calling card, with it's overpowered Gibson howl and this song howls all over the place. ""Denmark Vesey"" is a straight-up thrash song, sounding like a cross between classic Venom and Overkill. As much as I love their albums with Pepper Keenan at the helm, they just weren't hitting these thrash and speed metal tunes with Keenan. A song like ""The Nectar"", with it's breakneck rhythm and classic speed metal vocals, just wasn't an option on an album like Deliverance or Wiseblood. A little over a minute into this song we shift down to first gear and trudge along like some post-apolcalyptic war machine destroying everything in its path. This is southern metal sludge, something Mastodon and Kylesa used to do really well. Corrosion of Conformity are showing these younger bands up on IX.  Neither one of those bands have recorded a song like ""On Your Way"" in years. A meaty riff that could feed a village and metal drums that sound like a beast running through the wilds. ""Tarquinius Superbus"" sounds like a Helloween and Bad Brains mash-up. It's pure adrenaline and has a chorus that sticks in your head all day. ""Who You Need To Blame"" has a groove that brings to mind some of those classic earworm riffs from Deliverance. For the all-around metal fan or for someone like me who grew up in the 80s listening to bands on Metal Blade Records and lots of thrash this album is a smorgasbord of metal goodness.If you lost interest in CoC after America's Volume Dealer like I did, you should revisit them. IX is a new metal classic. Hardcore, thrash, speed, and sludge-y doom are awaiting to destroy your hearing and give your whiplash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2237QXEZXPXUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWKKQW#wasThisHelpful","R2237QXEZXPXUO","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Justin Vallesteros makes music that puts you in a particular place and time. He goes by the band name Craft Spells but like many younger, shy songwriters he‚Äôs really the only guy making all that magic and putting it to tape. Idle Labor was Craft Spells debut for the Brooklyn record label Captured Tracks and it showed Vallesteros was a songwriter pulling from the early 80s alternative scene that gave us bands like Depeche Mode, New Order, and a much leaner Cure. Though Craft Spells sounded like party music for a bunch of kids with eyeliner and teased hair there was still an element of loneliness. As upbeat as it sounded, it still had the feeling of a guy alone in his bedroom making soundtracks to non-existent teen films. Three years and one E.P. later Vallesteros returns with one of the most lush and detailed albums you‚Äôll likely hear this year. Nausea is a darkly lit record with the ease of a summer drive and the weight of a painful breakup.The album opens with the title track and the first thing you notice is the absence of electronic drums and tinkling synths. This is an album created with a band playing together. Justin Vallesteros has assembled musicians to make this album live and breathe. ‚ÄúNausea‚Äù moves and grooves slowly through four and a half minutes as keys create a dizzying effect on the listener. Vallesteros even sings differently this time around. His voice sounding not as low, he gives the vocals a much more lovelorn feel. Then you‚Äôre treated to the absolute beauty of ‚ÄúKomorebi‚Äù, a melancholy song that is carried along by a string part(possibly keys, possibly the real thing) and piano. Vallesteros‚Äô voice sounds as much an instrument as the piano does, delivering melody and sadness as the exquisite jazz-inflected drums carries the song along. It‚Äôs a beautiful song that deserves to be played through the summer and fall on repeat. ‚ÄúChanging Faces‚Äù keeps the dreamy vibe going. I have to admit that this song sounds like something Justin Vallesteros‚Äô label mate Jack Tatum would‚Äôve written. Tatum‚Äôs Wild Nothing has a similar career path, taking a drastic and wonderful turn on his sophomore album Nocturne. While in no way sounding like Wild Nothing, Vallesteros has gone from a smaller concentrated sound to something much more lush and detailed, like Tatum did. This is a sound that suits Craft Spells sensibility very well.Nausea is filled with little moments of beauty and detail, melancholy and grief. The Smiths haunt the track ‚ÄúDwindle‚Äù like an unfulfilled ghost. ‚ÄúTwirl‚Äù bounces and shakes like the Psychedelic Furs on a sugar rush, and ‚ÄúBreaking the Angle Against the Tide‚Äù brings back a little of that 4AD and early 80s Sire releases sound Vallesteros perfected on Idle Labor, with some help from some great-sounding strings. ‚ÄúStill Fields(October 10, 1987)‚Äù closes the album on a beautiful and lilting note. It puts you in mind of bands like Tangerine Dream and another Captured Tracks alumni Thieves Like Us; in particular their excellent instrumental album Berlin/Alex.I can only hope that Justin Paul. Vallesteros reads this at some point so he knows how much this album means to me and others. It‚Äôs a beautiful record filled with detail, mood, emotion, and heartache. He‚Äôs made a wonderful musical statement. A statement heard loud and clear by these ears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0B3FCL2U8B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQYUVTG#wasThisHelpful","R1X0B3FCL2U8B2","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't remember the first time I heard A Sunny Day In Glasgow, but I do remember how I felt. I felt as if I'd found this wonderful musical gift. Part dream pop, part shoegaze, and yet still totally modern. They were taking the building blocks of those late-80s noise genres and turning into something all their own. Ben Daniels and Ever Nalens started the band after returning to the US from being in Europe for years. Daniels is now the only original member after several line-up changes(including his twin sisters who sang in the band before leaving during the recording of their excelllent 2009 album Ashes Grammar.) Sea When Absent is long overdue, but the wait has been worth it.""Byebye, Big Ocean(The End)"" opens the album beautifully. It sounds like Kevin Shields remixing Cocteau Twins. Synths jumping from left to right as Annie Fredrickson and Jen Goma sing over the noise blasts. ""In Love With Useless(The Timeless Geometry in the Tradtion of Passing)"" is another blast of neo-futuristic pop. Towards the end of the song it turns into a Lush-like chorus. ""Crushin'"" brings Cocteau Twins to mind. Airy and melancholy. ""MTLOV(Minor Keys)"" is nothing short of inspiring with it's ""break in the clouds"" bigness.Ben Daniels doesn't wear his influences on his sleeve as much as he weaves them into the fabric of his shirt sleeve. ""The Things They Do To Me"" takes some modern Medicine and mixes it with a dash 80s synth pop. A collaboration between Brad Laner and Ben Daniels would be something to behold. ""Never Nothing(It's Alright[It's Ok])"" is A Sunny Day In Glasgow in full-on Cocteau Twins mode. This song would've sounded right at home on Blue Bell Knoll.What I love about A Sunny Day In Glasgow is that they create these emotional worlds where you're free to feel what you want. You're not led along like so many other bands do to their listeners. ""Feel sad now."" ""Feel happy now."" Sea When Absent is an album awash in emotional twists and turns. One person may find a song a bit melancholy while another will find the same song uplifting. That's the beautiful thing about dream pop and shoegaze, it's all about perspective. A Sunny Day In Glasgow have made a masterpiece of beautiful sound and at times haunting melody.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJBW3I7FCTBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZ8ZHTC#wasThisHelpful","R3PJBW3I7FCTBP","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There has been a gradual move for New York City's The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart; from a rough-around-the-edges sound on their debut to something resembling a sunny 80s pop sheen on their newest long player Days Of Abandon. The change is subtle, but there. On their debut album there was a slight darkness to the fuzzy pop hooks. You got the feeling My Bloody Valentine and Teenage Fanclub were spun quite a bit in the band's formative years. On their sophomore effort We Belong the band traded 4AD grit for Smashing Pumpkins grandiosity. Big guitar crunch took the place of shoegaze and post-punk flair. With Days Of Abandon the Pains' have embraced 80s FM radio and junior high dance soundtracks. It works for them, but I can't help pine for some of that darkness that's been lit up by neon lights.""Art Smock"" opens the album with a whispered vocal and musical refrain. At times this track sounds like Ezra Koenig stopped in to help out in the vocal department. ""Beautiful You"" could have been playing over the closing credits of any John Hughes film. Any of 'em, just take your pick. I'm picking 'Some Kind of Wonderful'. He didn't direct it, but he wrote it. ""Coral and Gold"" is an atmospheric little gem. You get the feeling there's some pain behind those words, ""I've been waiting for you, just waiting for you, When you gonna turn? I've been tracking your spine, mixing your blood with mine, When you gonna turn?"" The song builds into a beautiful crescendo before lilting at the end. ""Eurydice"" is that Bruce Springsteen and Pat Benatar collaboration we never got. At one point towards the end of the song I swear that Pat Benatar is singing the song's refrain. ""I turned cold in September air, I wanted to follow you anywhere, but you weren't anywhere I could go"" Berman sings as the band pumps up the chest-thumping moxie. ""Masokissed"" is big guitars and big keys that makes one long for a convertible and a sunset to drive into.Days Of Abandon is one lilting heartbreak put to 80s sunshine after another. It's a solid album. The biggest problem here is the lack of grit and grime that The Pains' used to their advantage back in 2009. There's nothing wrong with some sunshine and optimistic synths. It's just that once in a while a fuzzy melody and terse vocal help to make the album a more relatable experience. The once dark and tragic is replaced with something more universal, or ""one size fits all"".Regardless, it's a solid album that will soundtrack many summer parties and drives at dusk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YXRP7RUFYL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEK4A2G#wasThisHelpful","R25YXRP7RUFYL6","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think Adam Granduciel has a lot on his mind. Things that have laid heavy on his shoulders for a couple of years now. You wouldn‚Äôt know that at first listen to his excellent new album with The War On Drugs. ‚ÄúUnder The Pressure‚Äù has an uplift to it that most current artists that would attempt it would just come off as being ironic or pretentious. It has a promise in the delivery; the horns, synths, strummed acoustics give you the feeling that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning In America‚Äù once again. But listen a little closer and Granduciel tells a different story. Words are more personally apocalyptic. This is ‚ÄúMorning In America‚Äù for the latchkey kids and the lost souls, not the affluent and gated community members. ‚ÄúUnder The Pressure‚Äù is an anthem for the disenfranchised and disillusioned and damn is it catchy. Lost In The Dream is a reminder of a time back in the 80s when artists like Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, U2, and Dire Straits donned the Top Forty. It‚Äôs a reminder that pop songs were actually written by the performers of said songs. Adam Granduciel and The War On Drugs have written an album filled with massive songs and what could‚Äôve been huge hits 30 years ago. As it happens the 80s are dead but Granduciel didn‚Äôt get the memo.‚ÄúRed Eyes‚Äù is just ridiculously great. It‚Äôs got the feeling of Bruce Springsteen on a good day. All driving beats and pop bombast not seen since Bono used to dance with fans in front of the stage. I know the Springsteen connection has been mentioned ad nauseam but I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say listening to ‚ÄúRed Eyes‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take me back to 1984 and watching Bruce dance on stage with a then unknown Courtney Cox. Actually, this whole album takes me back to being a kid and taking trips into town with my mom and on a 20 minute drive hearing a handful of artists on pop radio that now are deemed as ‚Äúclassics‚Äù, or even legendary artists. Turn on the radio on your ride home from work today. Tell me if any one of those singers you hear will be deemed as classics or legends thirty years from now. Hell, how many of them actually wrote the song they‚Äôre singing? Those numbers will be small. I feel The War On Drugs have tapped into that classic vein. There‚Äôs not pretension, no irony, and no sly little grin. Here we have Adam Granduciel creating sonic journeys that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúof the time‚Äù. They‚Äôre timeless. It only took one listen to ‚ÄúSuffering‚Äù and that Leslie speaker guitar solo for me to realize that Granduciel is the real deal. Someone that writes a song as sublime and beautiful as that song isn‚Äôt trying to cop a feel and run. He‚Äôs in this for the long haul.There‚Äôs so much to love about this album. I can‚Äôt get into the lyrics as I haven‚Äôt quite broke the code as they say. The words are hazy and somewhat muddled by Granduciel‚Äôs delivery, but I know they‚Äôre important. Even on the album‚Äôs liner notes they‚Äôre nearly illegible to read, so I just go with how he says them more than what they really are. The music here is more than enough to win you over. ‚ÄúAn Ocean In Between The Waves‚Äù sounds like Petty‚Äôs ‚ÄúRunnin‚Äô Down A Dream‚Äù with Mark Knopfler on lead guitar. It‚Äôs an epic jam. When the drums kick in over the drum machine you feel like you kick in the 6th gear and hyper speed. ‚ÄúDisappearing‚Äù sounds like a lost collaboration between Bob Dylan and Dire Straits. Or some artist that never existed except in my mind. A song like ‚ÄúDisappearing‚Äù seems to have existed in my subconscious for 30 years and heard on so many bus rides and car rides in dreams. ‚ÄúEyes To The Wind‚Äù, the eerie instrumental ‚ÄúThe Haunting Idle‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBurning‚Äù all float along like some drug-induced and hallucinated radio station from my childhood. I was sick a lot as a kid. I was under the influence of many prescription medications. These songs feel old and worn-in to me. They feel comfortable and reassuring. ‚ÄúSuffering‚Äù is one of those songs that when it would‚Äôve came on the radio I‚Äôd turn my lousy little bedroom radio up as loud as it would go before the speaker would give. ‚ÄúLost In The Dream‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn Reverse‚Äù bring back some of that ambient noise and lilting melancholy that made Slave Ambient of 2011s best albums.This album hits me on a much deeper level than most. It brings up memories of childhood. Some that happened and some that didn‚Äôt. A childhood that exists in a random car ride with a random radio station. Songs that weren‚Äôt ever hits but should‚Äôve been hits, if this were a fair and just world.  Adam Granduciel and The War On Drugs have given us their version of ‚ÄúMorning In America‚Äù, regardless how dark it may be outside the window.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LL8ECFNGXEJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2A2T1O#wasThisHelpful","R1LL8ECFNGXEJ8","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hello. It‚Äôs good to be back from my mission to the fourth realm of Garzan. It was a rough flight, flying through the Araucaria Fire, just past the Eastman Oyster and landing near the Omega Oscillator. The native Garzanians call their home planet an ‚ÄúEarth of No Horizon‚Äù, which means if you look out onto the Synthemesc Sea there appears to be no seeming line where the purple skies of Garzan meet the blood-red seas of Synthemesc. If you head to the northern most peak of the Payan Mountains you‚Äôll find the Aya Powa tribe, or the ‚ÄúMantis in Lace‚Äù as it‚Äôs translated to in our human vernacular. They are a dangerous tribe, willing to kill on a whim(which sadly three of our crew members found out.)  Yes. It was a dangerous mission, but as they say ‚ÄúAmor Fati‚Äù, which is Latin for ‚Äúlove of fate‚Äù or ‚Äúlove of one‚Äôs fate‚Äù. Good or bad, it is what it is.""If dystopian landscapes, futuristic visions, and the bubbly analog howls that go along with those visions peak your interest in the least, then Jakob Skott has created a soundtrack to the most intense sci fi epic you‚Äôve never seen.For those that don‚Äôt know(and there are probably quite a few reading this that don‚Äôt), Jakob Skott is the drummer extraordinaire for the Danish psych band Causa Sui. Skott, along with Causa Sui guitarist -and solo artist in his own right- Jonas Munk started El Paraiso Records in Denmark so they could put out their records the way they want. Besides Causa Sui albums they‚Äôve released albums by fellow psych purveyors Papir and the American band Psicomagia. Munk and Skott have also put out records under their own names. This time around Jakob Skott is giving us his second solo record called Amor Fati. His previous effort was the lo fi-ish Doppler. That record bubbled and swooshed like some old analog machine found in an ancient lab. Amor Fati is decidedly crisper in its production but no less bubbly. It swirls and swells with analog warmth giving fans of both Boards of Canada and Tangerine Dream something to love dearly. ‚ÄúMantis in Lace‚Äù opens like something from a late-70s Tangerine Dream concept album. That is until Skott comes in on his drum set and proceeds to blow that thought out of the water. It‚Äôs like Tangerine Dream being backed up by Tony Williams. Skott isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfour on the floor‚Äù kind of drummer. He‚Äôs all over the place. He adds this organic element to the cold, desolate landscape of a post-apocalyptic world his synths bring to mind. ‚ÄúSynthemesc‚Äù rises from the ashes of a future war with square waves and radar readings of hope. Bleeps, swishes, and swooshes of sonic stabs come in and out. Amor Fati sounds like Boards of Canada after a long night of agitation and angst. This is what the dark(er) side of Tomorrow‚Äôs Harvest would sound like. ‚ÄúAraucaria Fire‚Äù sounds like ancient war drums bursting through a wall of flames as laser pierce the air in the background. This is 8 minutes of sonic grandeur. Again, Jakob Skott shows he has more musical interests than just beating on the drums, like building walls of analog noise. But he tears through those walls with tight grooves and snare rolls Buddy Rich would‚Äôve been proud to call his own.Really, I can‚Äôt say enough about this album. It ebbs and flows from hard, spacey funk(‚ÄúEastman Oyster‚Äù), to beautiful, hazy sunset drones(‚ÄúOmega Oscillator‚Äù), to just plain driving synth/drum strutting with a hint of electric Miles(‚ÄúAmor Fati‚Äù). Jakob Skott has so much more to offer than just being a hell of a drummer. But yeah, he‚Äôs one hell of a drummer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TW47XHKW1ZZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDBJVDA#wasThisHelpful","R3TW47XHKW1ZZU","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cheatahs singer and guitarist and general lead guy Nathan Hewitt wears his influences proudly on his sleeve. Listening to Cheatahs self-titled LP they echo in every nook and cranny. The fuzzy, tremolo-bent chords, the reverbed and echoing vocals, and the steady pulse of drums and bass moving in unison harken back to a time in the late 80s when bands like My Bloody Valentine, Swervedriver, Chapterhouse, and Slowdive were making a name for themselves in the UK and abroad as the purveyors of this new kind of loud, abrasive, yet at times very melancholy music called shoegaze. I think Hewitt -originally from Edmonton, Canada but moved to London- had a few of those albums running through his head. Much like bands such as Yuck, Young Prisms, and even Speedy Ortiz, Cheatahs aren‚Äôt making something new here, or even re-writing what was already done. What they are doing is writing some great songs in the key of Shields, Bell, and Mascis.Opening with a short instrumental interlude, the album explodes into ‚ÄúGeographic‚Äù, a noisy little number that sounds like Kevin Shields guesting on Doves Lost Souls. Imagine ‚ÄúCatch The Sun‚Äù sped up to 45rpms and Kevin Shields doing some of his chord bending magic, then you‚Äôd have a good idea of what this song is about. ‚ÄúNorthern Exposure‚Äù, to the best of my knowledge has nothing to do with the quirky 90s TV show, but it does bring to mind the blown out pop of Teenage Fanclub and the fuzzed-out glee of Bug-era Dinosaur Jr. It‚Äôs a great song that also brings to mind Canada‚Äôs reigning indie rock Godfathers Sloan as well. ‚ÄúMission Creep‚Äù brings things down a notch, but in no way does it get sleepy. From the get go this is a guitar album, and Hewitt seems to enjoy playing his six-string. Many layers of stomp box-colored guitars paint the canvas here, which seems to extend clear back to the early 90s indie rock heyday. Hewitt‚Äôs vocals bring to mind Fountains of Wayne‚Äôs Chris Collingwood, had he fronted Straitjacket Fits. ‚ÄúIV‚Äù is a real gem. If I didn‚Äôt know this was Cheatahs I‚Äôd say Kevin Shields was back at it and making a new record. Full of wavering, fuzzy chords and hazy vocals, this track is a mixture of beautiful guitar sonic dizziness and great melancholy pop finesse in the vocals. A shoegaze slacker anthem.There‚Äôs nothing to skip over on this record. Hewitt and Cheatahs seem to have made an album with no filler. From indie fuzz pop(‚ÄúGet Tight‚Äù) to an almost classic rock strut(‚ÄúThe Swan‚Äù) and of course shoegaze indifference(‚ÄúIV‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeave To Remain‚Äù, ‚ÄúFall‚Äù, ‚ÄúLoon Calls‚Äù), Cheatahs is a record to play loudly and frequently. Nathan Hewitt wears his influences proudly on his sleeve, and that‚Äôs just fine with me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4USPCJAPA3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP2LEMU#wasThisHelpful","R2I4USPCJAPA3Q","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm about 10 minutes into ‚ÄúParaphernalia‚Äù on the recently reissued Miles at The Fillmore and I feel like I‚Äôm coming down from some bad trip. Not the kind of trip you‚Äôd have with your pals in mom and dad‚Äôs basement on a Saturday afternoon. Not a sugar buzz, or LSD. No, like some back alley fix with Mr. Brownstone. Sort of a psychotic breakdown in the midst of some hedonistic mirage brought on by opiates mainlined from a syringe. Electric piano creates this funky vibe, as funky as demonic possession goes. Drums create a tribal beat to lose your soul to while Miles‚Äô trumpet creates the melody in the insanity. It‚Äôs a jarring experience, and one that I‚Äôm sure was overpowering for anyone sitting in the audience at the Fillmore on April 11, 1970. Though, not all of the performances captured here are from April 11, 1970. June 17th through the 20th of 1970 were also dates captured for this collection. Originally released as a double album with extremely edited versions of the songs, this epic and phenomenal album is now presented in its full glory with Davis‚Äô full performances. You don‚Äôt get just the rock bits and heavy funk. You get all the beautiful space in-between. You get four hours of a headspace that mere mortals cannot handle for more than 20 minutes at a time without losing their grasp on sanity. This is not for the weak of heart or mind.I‚Äôm a fan. I fell hard for Miles Davis, and a couple months ago I was scouring Discogs for all those lesser known albums that surrounded Bitches Brew and beyond. One in-particular was Big Fun. That record, from what I read, was just supposed to be leftovers from various sessions that never got properly released. To my ears, it‚Äôs one of Davis‚Äô best albums from this era. Spacious, psychedelic, and at times teasingly sparse. Not every nook and cranny is filled with Miles blowing his horn. In fact, it‚Äôs a spacious set of songs that I can pretty much listen to on a daily basis. ‚ÄúGo Ahead John‚Äù being the most straight up rock track, but still Teo Macero does some amazing things with stereo panning that makes the track all the more special.But hey, I‚Äôm supposed to be talking about Miles at The Fillmore.This is a dense set of tunes, and at 4 hours I‚Äôd recommend it in smaller doses. If you‚Äôre painting walls or something, this could be good to have on as you‚Äôre working. But if you‚Äôre looking for something to listen to whilst sitting on the couch sipping a stout, definitely mix it up with some lighter fare. After a short introduction the crew goes into ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù which is a messy and noisy number that Davis‚Äô band was known for at the time. His band is exemplary with Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett on keys, Steve Grossman on sax, Dave Holland on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Davis on trumpet. This is a much tighter post-Bitches Brew band than he later sported with the live Pangaea and Agharta albums(both very good in their own right.) With a rhythm section of Holland and DeJohnette sloppy isn‚Äôt an option. ‚ÄúThe Mask‚Äù is like a fever-ish nightmare brought on by opiates and broken aspirations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs About That Time‚Äù is nearly an experimental number with whistles and what sounds like the cash registers in Pink Floyd‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù. It‚Äôs all pent up aggresion quietly sitting in the bushes waiting for you to take your eyes away for a second so it can pounce. They then go into a nearly 14 minute version of ‚ÄúBitches Brew‚Äù that has a tribal vibe to it. You almost expect someone to start reading from Joseph Conrad‚Äôs Heart of Darkness. The double trouble duo of Corea and Jarrett create the dark funk that pushes this piece so well. Bitches Brew plays heavy on this four hour set, with different versions of the same tracks popping up from time to time. One of my favorite tracks on this collection is ‚ÄúMiles Runs The Voodoo Down‚Äù, a gritty rendition that slithers and slides like a snake. You can almost feel the grit on this one. I love how this band can drop the theatrics and tension and just let loose. Speaking of let loose, towards the end of this set the band jumps into the Jack Johnson Sessions‚Äô ‚ÄúWillie Nelson‚Äù and lay down some excellent funky goodness. The loose grooves of ‚ÄúMiles Runs the Voodoo Down‚Äù and ‚ÄúWillie Nelson‚Äù are a welcome treat for the ears in a dense set of mostly dark, serious fusion.I recommend this album to anyone who considers themselves a true fan of Davis‚Äô early to mid 70s output, and especially those that actually owned this vinyl when it first came out. You‚Äôre in for a real treat. For once, Macero‚Äôs editing prowess didn‚Äôt enhance this set. It neutered it. These tracks back to their massive, dense, and original form show an artist and his band at their most creative and confrontational.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK189GS1AGJ96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSCDX70#wasThisHelpful","RK189GS1AGJ96","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I became aware of this Italian psych-pop band called The Vickers. They had a Bandcamp page that sported two very excellent tunes. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Lost‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Know What It Is‚Äù sounded like tracks pulled from a time capsule that had been buried under the fertile soils of Florence, Italy for the past 45 years. Filled with both psychedelic flourishes and pop hooks that planted themselves firmly in your brain and wouldn‚Äôt leave for days, these songs were teases of what would eventually be a full-length record. The tease is over, and The Vickers have arrived with the aforementioned full-length titled Ghosts. It‚Äôs a great debut that delivers on the promise of those first two tracks.The Vickers‚Äô sound is firmly planted between the years 1965 to 1967. If there‚Äôs a blueprint to their brand of rock n‚Äô roll it would be The Beatles‚Äô Revolver. Lead singer and guitarist Andrea Mastropietro sounds very much like John Lennon, with hints of Kevin Parker thrown in for good measure. He‚Äôs not aping Lennon, he just naturally sounds like him. ‚ÄúSenseless Life‚Äù opens like an acoustic version of ‚ÄúA Day In The Life‚Äù before becoming something completely its own. The Vickers are a tight rock n‚Äô roll band. They show that throughout Ghosts. Where most psych bands tend to go for that weathered, wavering tape wobble in the sonic department these Italian rockers tend to go for a very clean, classical approach to sound. Drums are crisp, clean, and almost jazzy in delivery. Vocals are clear but somewhere down in a reverb-drenched hole, while bass and guitars swirl in a technicolor kaleidoscope of sound. The Vickers take pride in how they present their songs and it comes through. ‚ÄúHear Me Now‚Äù sounds like Cheap Trick-meets-Smithereens with a splash of Wilco in that great guitar tone(if you‚Äôre familiar with ‚ÄúSpiders(Kidsmoke)‚Äù you‚Äôll recognize that effect instantly.) Spacey and trippy this track begs you to get lost for it‚Äôs four minutes. ‚ÄúInside A Dream‚Äù starts out quiet and builds into a psychedelic froth, complete with a great drum freakout at the end. You never get the feeling of being put on by these guys. So many bands put the psych name tag on because they feel that‚Äôs going to get fans and sell records. The Vickers take elements of psych and pop and classic rock n‚Äô roll, mix ‚Äòem up in a tasty gelato with a flavor all their own. ‚ÄúWalking On A Rope‚Äù reminds you of some of those classic Townsend acoustic numbers that blow up into some great noise. And I think there‚Äôs harpsichord in there as well. Gotta love some harpsichord. The album closes with the title track that takes us out on a crisp, jazzy ride cymbal and Andrea‚Äôs melancholy vocals before they get swallowed by a massive wall of reverb.The Vickers‚Äô Ghosts is a great album to get lost in on a breezy afternoon or a starlit evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LGR4KNCTND0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMN10P6#wasThisHelpful","R3LGR4KNCTND0O","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you notice as you listen to Streetlamps for Spotlights full-length debut Sound and Color is how much these guys love texture. Sometimes it‚Äôs subtle, but these textural layers are always present in the songs. Whether it‚Äôs in Jason Davis‚Äô guitar work with jagged punches of riffs and noise, or in Jay Hackbush‚Äôs solid bass lines keeping things afloat, or Ryan Holquist‚Äôs pounding drums going from solid rhythms to full on post-punk explosions -sometimes in the same song- the textures are there. As well as being the 6-string guru of SfS Davis sings over these aural explosions, sometimes like a man on a mission and sometimes like a man looking hopelessly for answers. Always though, with a purpose. Sound and Color is part post-punk manifesto and part grizzled, razor wire pop record. Several singles over the last few years have built up to this statement of musical authority. Streetlamps for Spotlights are ready for their close-up.This debut makes it perfectly clear that Davis, Hackbush, and Holquist are a force to be reckoned with. ‚ÄúReady Already‚Äù opens the album like an explosion of pissed-off conviction. You can almost see the spittle flying in the air as Davis sings ‚ÄúAre you ready already?!‚Äù Musically this is a barbed-wire slash of a song, with noise that would make Sonic Youth(RIP) jealous and salivate. But then gears shift in the great ‚ÄúRight Back‚Äù, which turns the previous angst in the album opener into an alternative pop gem. The previously mentioned textures? Yeah, they‚Äôre all over this one. ‚ÄúSomeday‚Äù sounds like Green Mind-era Dino Jr, especially in Davis‚Äô guitar work. Hackbush and Holquist give SfS that very unique, almost metal-like backbone allowing Davis to keep things loose and spacey in the mid-section. ‚ÄúCall it Off‚Äù is just a scorcher, with some speaker-melting guitar and Holquist completely abusing the drums.The truly unique thing about these guys is that they keep the mood just slightly off kilter. Just when you think a song is gonna do one thing it does something else. There‚Äôs always this underlying dissonance in the music that keeps it becoming, well, ‚Äúaverage‚Äù I guess. There‚Äôs some amazing interplay between these three players and the songs benefit greatly from Davis‚Äô eschewed view of the universe. Take a track like ‚ÄúWalking‚Äù. It‚Äôs this at times eerie-sounding track with Davis having a conversation with someone about if he were to just walk away and not come back would they even care, as the song fades with a guitar ringing into space. It‚Äôs a great balance between artistic reach and melodic presence in a song. It satisfies all the senses. You don‚Äôt get fluff from these guys. Then they follow it up with a bombastic track like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Worry‚Äù which just straight up rocks. And ‚ÄúDamaged‚Äù? It wouldn‚Äôt have sounded out of place on an early Cheap Trick record. I can only imagine between the three of these guys their influences are quite expansive. They take them all and mesh them quite well, but are subtle enough with them that you can never quite put your finger on who a particular song sounds like. It just sounds like Streetlamps for Spotlights. ‚ÄúLies‚Äù and the wonderful ‚ÄúNew Year‚Äôs Ball‚Äù won‚Äôt be mistook for anything but SfS songs. Title track and album closer ‚ÄúSound and Color‚Äù leave us with these words, ‚ÄúWill we still be doing this when we are 60/Same thing we‚Äôve been doing since we were 16.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sentiment that could be taken more than one way.Sound and Color is an album that at it‚Äôs core is about the hurt of loss; the hurt of losing someone. But around that core is a noisy, jangly, jagged rock n‚Äô roll album that is one of the best to ever come out of Fort Wayne. The trio of Davis, Hackbush, and Holquist swirl noise like Pollock dripped paint. It can be messy and sometimes abstract, but always quite wonderful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXUCJ1W1G35I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHBKA4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3QXUCJ1W1G35I","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Causa Sui have been putting out true psychedelic rock for almost ten years. In those ten years they‚Äôve transcended the genre into something completely their own. Starting out with a more fuzzed-out stoner rock vibe on their first two records the Denmark natives switched gears on 2008s Summer Sessions, Vol 1-3 by creating more mind-expanding long form jams that harken back to electric Miles, Can, and some of the more progressive psychedelia of the late 60s and early 70s(I‚Äôm looking at you Hawkwind.) From 2008 on Causa Sui made music for the lover of music you can get lost in. Worlds form and decay, centuries pass and light years are traveled all in the course of one of Causa Sui‚Äôs many excellent expansive albums. Last year‚Äôs excellent Euporie Tide seemed to be a concentrated version of the band‚Äôs discography. Sometimes Sabbath-heavy, sometimes quietly serene, and sometimes dream-like and hallucinogenc, its one hour plus run time covered all the bases. Now we have Live at Freak Valley, a live testament to the band‚Äôs musical prowess. It‚Äôs a shining example of what these four guys can do when given a stage and a couple hours to blow minds.Freak Valley Festival is a music festival that takes place in Siegen, Germany. Someone once said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to do in Siegen‚Äù, so the folks at Freak Valley decided to change that. A who‚Äôs who of psych, doom, and stoner rock bands have played the festival and Causa Sui can now be added to the roster. Listening to Live at Freak Valley you‚Äôre amazed at how four guys can fill every nook and cranny with sound. Jonus Munk(guitar), Jakob Skott(drums), Jess Kahr(bass), and Rasmus Rasmussen(keys) take their signature tracks and open them up. They expand on the ideas laid to tape and let them breathe on the Freak Valley stage. Musical beasts that roam the room melting faces and minds alike. The medley of ‚ÄúLonesome Traveller/Santa Sangre/Garden of Forking Paths‚Äù is 14 minutes of swirling noise, pounding rhythms, and psych guitar freakouts the likes of you haven‚Äôt heard since the heyday of acid blotter and liquid light shows. But this music isn‚Äôt to be written off as cookie cutter psych rock. There‚Äôs muscle to these songs. Causa Sui never relies on the idea that 20 minutes of mindless jamming will satisfy the red-eyed masses. At times these tracks explode into massive, riff-heavy glory reminding you why Black Sabbath were so great in the first place. ‚ÄúMireille‚Äù opens triumphantly and strides along like a gallant steed before Munk engages the wah pedal and begins to lay down some serious Pete Cosey-like jams. At times Rasmussen‚Äôs keys sound more like another guitar than keys, but when he throws in some organ it feels like 1970 and Jon Lord all over again. I have to say Rasmus Rasmussen really does create a mood. He keeps things spacey and weird, while the rest of the band can jam like Cream on a good night. Skott holds his own as this band‚Äôs Ginger Baker, blasting his drums like a maniac but never losing the groove, while Kahr holds the low end down never letting Skott float off into space. And Jonas Munk knows just when to blow up and when to pull back. ‚ÄúRed Valley‚Äù has an ominous vibe, filled with tension and a restraint you feel could explode at any moment. It was a highlight of Summer Sessions, Vol.3 and it‚Äôs a highlight here as well. Over three minutes into this track it turns into this Sleep-like doom bruiser and proceeds to get delightfully noisy. When Rasmussen comes in with the space swirls the track settles back down into a mellow vibe. ‚ÄúEl Paraiso‚Äù and ‚ÄúEuporie‚Äù is some of the best live freakouts I‚Äôve ever heard. Put on some headphones and disappear into the ether. And ‚ÄúHomage‚Äù sounds even more like Smashing Pumpkins‚Äô ‚ÄúCherub Rock‚Äù live, except without all the whining. Simply excellent.The band burns through nine tracks in nearly ninety minutes. They hit classics like ‚ÄúEl Paraiso‚Äù and the aforementioned ‚ÄúLonesome Traveller/Santa Sangre/Garden of Forking Paths‚Äù, but over half the setlist consists of Euporie Tide songs which is great. You can hear the band open these songs up and let them breathe and grow. They improvise and riff on these tunes like jazz players. Jazz players with a penchant for fuzz boxes and heavy psychedelics. As far as live albums go, Live at Freak Valley is one of the best.I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll never see Causa Sui live. Unless I take a vacation in Denmark or they line up a US tour sometime in the near future Live at Freak Valley is the closest I‚Äôll get to hearing these Danish psych masters do their thing live and in the raw. Thanks to this excellent live testatment I can be happy with that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCTZPJ07MRII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISA6P9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1TCTZPJ07MRII","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first heard Mac Demarco on Rock And Roll Night Club I felt kind of queasy. It was an uncomfortable feeling, really. Even the album cover with Demarco putting on lipstick put me in mind of Jame Gumb from Silence of the Lambs doing the same thing. You know, right before the tuck and dance that no one will ever forget? Anyways, Mac Demarco gave off this bizarre vibe that was part super friendly dude at the laundromat that was always wanting to talk; and part super creepy dude at the laundromat that was always wanting to get your phone number. Once he released 2 the creepy vibe subsided a bit. It became this huffing-induced happiness that made you think as long as you were in an alternate state you‚Äôd probably really like this guy. After several listens the petroleum-soaked rag wasn‚Äôt needed; Mac Demarco was indeed a weirdo but one that could write really catchy songs. Salad Days improves on the fidelity and sunny disposition of 2, and even makes Mac an endearing kind of guy. Endearing in a way David Foster Wallace would write endearing.Demarco has described his style of music as ‚Äújizz jazz‚Äù, and disconcerting as that description is it does fit. Not quite pop music, but not weird enough to be anything else, Mac Demarco‚Äôs music is woozy and dreamy much like the feeling of an inner ear infection and a heavy dose of painkillers. ‚ÄúSalad Days‚Äù starts up as if 2 just finished spinning, with a Kinks vibe in the ‚ÄúPicture Book‚Äù-esque ‚Äúla la la la la‚Äôs‚Äù. Even though he claims to using second, third, and fourth rate instruments to make his albums I don‚Äôt think anything else would do for Mac Demarco. A song like ‚ÄúBlue Boy‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs slightly out-of-tune charm with a well built guitar. It needs a bent neck and lousy tuners in order to give it the proper ‚Äújizz jazz‚Äù treatment. ‚ÄúBrother‚Äù wavers more on the jazz side of things, with an almost soft rock lean. Anyone else doing this in 2014 would be shunned and sent home to cry on their Steely Dan records, but Demarco does this sort of thing with just enough earnestness while slyly grinning you can‚Äôt help but dig it. ‚ÄúLet Her Go‚Äù has an island sway. It‚Äôs a song that should be playing during those summer backyard barbeques or when stalking that ex-girlfriend on a warm summer night. ‚ÄúPassing Out Pieces‚Äù is a decidedly different sound, with more of that signature Captured Tracks sound. What‚Äôs that sound, you say? Well it‚Äôs bringing in a analog synth and cranking up the 80s-style keys and letting them tell the story. ‚ÄúWhat mama don‚Äôt know, has taken it‚Äôs toll on me‚Äù Demarco sings over a jaunty and well-aged groove. This sound is a good fit for Mac.I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that Mac Demarco is a weirdo at heart, but not the creepy weirdo of Rock and Roll Night Club lore. He‚Äôs just an off-kilter guy that happens to play fourth-rate instruments in order to make first rate songs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31IXJNIOC1G8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY68WFS#wasThisHelpful","R31IXJNIOC1G8Q","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead Leaf Echo do the shoegaze thing really well. They also do 80s alternative really well. On their new EP, aptly titled true.deep.sleeper they conjure visions of Echo and the Bunnymen, The Cure, and a goth-ish romanticism that though no new ground is being broken the music pulls you in and makes you long for that high school crush you had when you were 16.Title track ‚Äútrue.deep.sleeper‚Äù brings to mind Disintegration-era Cure with a Cocteau Twins finish. The heavy reverb and wah-wah guitar give the song a swirling motion and a hallucinogenic glee you can‚Äôt help but get sucked into. Drummer Kevin K. really pulls the track together with his classic hyper-drive UK dance beat as the guitar and keys spin into a drugged frenzy. ‚Äúso.wrong‚Äù makes me feel I‚Äôm back in 1986 and Disintegration is playing on my parent‚Äôs car stereo. This song is all joyful gloom and hazy anticipation.Dead Leaf Echo have been leading the charge along with other bands such as Young Prisms, Anne, and a good portion of the Captured Tracks roster to get folks to look back kindly on that time in the late 80s and early 90s when the UK was cultivating what we now know as the shoegaze movement. Bands like Chapterhouse, Ride, My Bloody Valentine, and Lush as well as American bands Medicine and Half String created a sonic swirl that can‚Äôt be denied even today. Dead Leaf Echo recreate that magic and put their own unique spin on the genre. ‚Äúblind.island‚Äù is a short, slightly psychedelic interlude before ‚Äúheaven.sent.sleeper‚Äù finishes the EP out. It‚Äôs a slow drop into the abyss. Voices drip down the walls as you ride into the depths on a steady bass line. As an added bonus the track is a collaboration with Lansing, Michigan‚Äôs dream pop veterans Auburn Lull. It‚Äôs a track you can just melt into.Dead Leaf Echo continue to make solid shoegaze and dream pop. This time around the production is as solid as ever with Monte Vallier(The Soft Moon and Weekend) mixing the album to its fullest potential. Make sure you head over to their Soundcloud page and give this excellent EP a listen. Headphones are preferable, but not necessary. Just play it loud.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLWUW2EL6HCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFZIOP0#wasThisHelpful","R2FLWUW2EL6HCP","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most arresting, pounding, and quite beautiful 40 minutes you could spend would be with Nothing's Guilty Of Everything. Imagine this vast black space and you're staring down into it. It's scary as hell, and you see no discernible bottom in this cavernous hole. Yet there's something quite beautiful emanating from it that draws you nearer. It's the beautiful drone that envelopes you and beckons you closer and closer to the edge till you realize you're in the darkness. It surrounds you, blankets you, and holds you within the black. And you don't mind. That is the magic of Guilty Of Everything. Musically it pummels you and pushes you into the wall till your bruised and battered, yet lead Nothing Dominic Palermo sings in a pushed whisper. It's as if the music forces the air out of his lungs, allowing him to reveal his deep, dark secrets. Those secrets? A rough start of things, violence, incarceration, and then eventually some serious soul searching which led to Palermo making music as Nothing. Guilty Of Everything is their debut full-length and shows a band in top form and with many more stories to tell.""Hymn To The Pillory"" makes me think of gray clouds, drooping pines, and muddy landscapes with crumbling city streets in the far distance. The negative to a Pennsylvania snapshot. It could be the Pacific Northwest or southern Ohio for that matter but since Nothing hail from Philly then Pennsylvania fits just fine. This song encapsulates years of hopes and dreams dirtied and tattered. The music is heavy shoegaze. It's like Whirr cranked to 11. Then ""Dig"" charges in sounding like Deafheaven fronted by Elliot Smith. It's an absolutely stunning track. Guitars bounce off reverbed walls as Palermo sings, well, I'm not sure what he's singing. But it's not really what he's saying more than how he's saying it. And how he says it makes me think he really means it. ""Endlessly"" evokes a feeling vastness as  Palermo's voice feels as if it surrounds you and engulfs you. That blackness; that void. It's always there so you learn to live with it. Cope with it.The album is mixed with moments of propulsion and slow burn. One minute you're crawling on your hands and knees through broken glass and debris towards some mysterious light; the next minute you're being pushed towards the light by some unknown force. You can't help but think that songs like ""Somersault"", ""Get Well"", and ""B&E"" are direct connections to Palermo's past. Aural snapshots of dark times he's now trying to make sense of and heal from. Last track ""Guilty Of Everything"" seems to be an open letter to the universe written in blood-red ink. A plea for some kind of peace. Or to at least be able to get through another day.Listening to Guilty Of Everything, despite the despair in so many of the songs you get the feeling that these are snapshots of a past life. Dominic Palermo seems to have made some kind of peace with his demons and is sharing his journey and what he's learned through these intense, swirling kaleidoscopes of songs. Nothing's Guilty Of Everything is intense, heavy, hazy, and filled with dark beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEOP0ZBRMUGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HW3EUSQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IEOP0ZBRMUGH","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've seen Andrew Bird live twice in my life. The first time was at the Chicago Opera House back in early 2009. The second time was at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, IN in the fall of 2009. Both shows were stunning, Bird displaying a mastery of musical art like no other. But both shows were different versions of Andrew Bird. The Chicago show was the meticulous, almost dandy-like version of the musician with the first twenty minutes nothing but Bird with several mics and standing in the middle of a circle of looper pedals. Moving from pedal to pedal he created a veritable orchestra with nothing more than looped violin lines and whistles. It was breathtaking and awe-inspiring, and I'm sure it's also maddening to keep everything in time and on cue as well. The fall show was something altogether different. It was loose, loud, and jangly. Bird played a beat up Fender Mustang as much as he played his cherished violin. He seemed to want to prove to the world that he could get noisy and rock like the best of `em. For the most part he succeeded in that.I Want to See Pulaski at Night is an e.p., though not an e.p. in the classic sense. For most artists this would be considered a full blown album, not an e.p. Clocking in at over 32 minutes this is more of a mini-album(unless you're Sufjan Stevens, then an e.p. is roughly around an hour long.) It seems Mr. Bird wrote a great song called ""Pulaski at Night"" and instead of holding onto it until he had an album's worth of music to share along with it he wrote several incidental musical pieces that followed the same musical twists and turns of ""Pulaski at Night"". The result is the mostly instrumental I Want to See Pulaski at Night, a wonderful addition to Andrew Bird's musical canon.If you're at all familiar with his companion record to 2009s Noble Beast titled Useless Creatures, and even his 2003 album Weather Systems, then you already know what to expect here. The center of this e.p. is ""Pulaski at Night"" for sure, but instrumental numbers like ""Ethio Invention No.1‚Ä≥, ""Lit from Underneath"", and ""Hover l &ll"" create a sort of suite that helps make this a cohesive musical journey that could've scored some independent film or quirky documentary you'd see on IFC late some Sunday evening. Bird has delved into film scoring already(2010s Norman)and has proven to be rather adept at it. His music is already very visual, creating scenes in the mind with the mere pluck of a violin string or a looped whistle creating counter melodies within counter melodies. I Want to See Pulaski at Night is a further step towards becoming the next Cliff Martinez, or to a lesser extent Johnny Greenwood.What Andrew Bird wrote this mini-album? Was it the meticulous plucker and whistler from the  Chicago Opera House; or the loose and jangly Murat Theater version? More the former than the latter this time around, but both are present and accounted for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3026QBWBVZ1M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G79EG5S#wasThisHelpful","R3026QBWBVZ1M9","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earthless are like this massive scream of psychedelic squall that came from 40 years ago and is just now making its way to our ears. The music they make is no fuss, stoned, rock n' roll that fans of Sleep and Cream alike can get lost in. Since 2005 guitarist Isaiah Mitchell, bassist Mike Eginton, and drummer Mario Rubalcaba have been putting massive improvisational jams to tape and have been putting the universe's stamp of approval on each vinyl pressed. Make no qualms about it, if things like ten minute guitar solos, thunderous bass, and Bonzo-esque drums make you cringe and reach for that Dirty Projectors mix tape, then please exit stage left. If phrases like ""zone-out"", ""stare off into space"", and ""get lost in song"" are vernacular that are used by you more often than you'd like to admit, please, sit down and take a load off. Prepare to have your cerebral cortex massaged with epic riffage.San Diego has bestowed upon the world a true gift in rockers Earthless. And From The Ages, Earthless' first album in six years proves that massive and muscular jams are the gift that keep on giving. ""Violence of the Red Sea"" opens up and lets you know right off the bat where we're headed. A 15 minute improvisational display of guitar battery, bass beating, and drum bashing that brings to mind a cross between the best Robin Trower had to offer with his time playing with Jack Bruce and Jimi Hendrix and Band of Gypsies. Unlike some of Earthless' contemporaries such as White Hills and Assemble Head In Sunburst Sound, this San Diego band keeps things a little lighter. Despite the connotations of floating in outer space with a name like Earthless, this band is very much earth-bound thanks to the aggressive yet soulful guitar playing of Isiah Mitchell. Somewhere on a purple cloud of fairy dust, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton's self respect are smiling down on every pull, sweep, and run Mitchell pulls out of his magic riff bag. Unlike so many dead-eyed wannabe guitar heroes that love to play the mimic game, Mitchell is the real deal. And not only is Earthless as a whole pulling influence from Hendrix, Clapton, and Black Sabbath, but it's apparent that this power trio in the classic sense have the spirit of Coltrane and Davis attending these improvisational epic sprawls put to tape. It's not aimless noodling on tracks like ""Uluru Rock"" and the wonderfully sublime ""Equus October"", there's a real flow. You're moving from movement to movement; it's just that these guys make it seem so natural that you never know you're being guided by Earthless' ethereal hand. But just when you think your mind is completely mush, in comes the album closer, the 30 minute magnum opus ""From The Ages"". It's a sprawling epic ride through light and dark, squall and groove, and epic, epic riffs. The drums keep the tempo firmly in the red lining area, while guitars blow up into blasts of cacophony before the wah is engaged and faces begin to melt. I'd read that Earthless isn't a ""stoner rock"" band, but a ""coffee rock"" band. ""From The Ages"" is the aural proof, as the guys must've been hitting the espresso during this recording session. Mind. Blown.Whether you're a fan of those classic power trios like the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, or you go for some of the modern psych/stoner/space rock, it doesn't matter cause Earthless have you covered, from the earth to the moon. And beyond.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DSPJGD66WU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI41MGA#wasThisHelpful","R14DSPJGD66WU1","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yuck dropped one of the most surprising and enjoyable chunks of music nostalgia in 2011 with their debut album. There was plenty to sit back and get reminiscent about on that record. My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr, Lush, and even bits of Pavement's DNA were found all over that ratty, scrappy record. But the nice thing was that head Yuckster Daniel Blumberg wasn't satisfied with being just some early 90s alternative jukebox. No, he gave these old, classic noises a new life. With his youthful whine and scrappy guitar squall Blumberg and co-Yuck founder Max Bloom seemed to be on the way to being the next great band out of the UK. Then Daniel Blumberg decided to leave Yuck(cue Fat Possum Record executives long sigh.) So what's a promising, young, alternative rock band to do? Pick themselves up by their bootstraps and keep on keeping on. Max Bloom stepped into the lead singer spot and along with fellow bandmates Mariko Doi, Jonny Rogoff, and Ed Hayes got back to the studio and recorded the proper follow-up to that great self-titled debut. Glow & Behold is both triumphant and bittersweet. Triumphant in that the rest of Yuck proved they didn't need Blumberg to continue on with making great music, but bittersweet in that it's a reminder of what might have been had they been able to keep together.""Sunrise In Maple Shade"" opens the record in instrumental mode. The doorway through to the house that 90s indie rock built. Close your eyes and you swear it's a Terror Twilight lost track. Soon enough ""Out Of Time"" rolls in and its melancholy chord changes and Real Estate vibe sucks you right in. Max Bloom lacks the whine that Blumberg made Yuck's trademark sound, but that's not a bad thing. Bloom's voice is more assured and can carry a melody further than Blumberg could. The band as a whole seem more confident and less ramshackle. Maybe it's having one album under their belt, or maybe it's that Yuck V.1 was a completely different band. Either way, this isn't a group attempting to rekindle that band's ""magic"". This is a band moving on. ""Lose My Breath"" is another great upbeat song that captures both the grit and glitter of some of those great alternative pop college radio staples. Something like a Jesus and Mary Chain and Hope Sandoval mash up. ""Rebirth"" is a haze of Kevin Shields-like guitar noise and a pop hook that will embed itself in your brain for days. I don't think Yuck V.1 would've gotten away with this sort of wide-eyed songwriting. ""Nothing New"" is acoustic strums and girl group minor key drama that would've sounded right at home on a Teenage Fanclub record. ""Glow And Behold"" closes the record on a Big Star-meets-Ride vibe, which then rides the album out on a single guitar loop.The biggest change since Blumberg left is that the production is decidedly more ""hi-fi"", and the songwriting is much more open-hearted and earnest. There doesn't seem to be any need to hide those big, sappy pop hooks in guitar noise, feedback, and disenchantment. That debut was lightning in a bottle. It was an anomaly that rarely happens when bands wear their influences so proudly and openly, and at times this new album seems to lack a bit from not having that debut's scrappy charm. But Glow & Behold was never meant to be that debut all over again. It's essentially a new beginning, and Yuck is off to a good start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20W1HHV4MF4H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIEPRGQ#wasThisHelpful","R20W1HHV4MF4H5","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, it's always kind of a bummer when someone releases a really promising debut only to follow it up with a not so promising sophomore release. It makes me sad, really. All that greatness you enjoyed about that first album just disappears in to the ether as a second album filled with schmaltz and wimpery(my word)fills your ears and makes you want to cleanse them with a bar of lye and a brillow pad. This is the case with Mauro Remiddi's follow-up to his first album as Porcelain Raft. Strange Weekend was filled with all these great nuggets of analog synths and interesting beats given a hazy, drugged-out feel. I believe the kids called it ""chillwave"" way back in 2012. In 2013, I believe it's called ""meh""wave.The first noticeable difference in Permanent Signal compared to Strange Weekend is that Remiddi's voice is way up in the mix this time around. Not processed at all, really. It's floating right there in your face daring you to compare him to Erasure's Andy Bell. Or Air Supply's Russell Hitchcock. I'm not saying Remiddi's voice is bad. He sings in key. But the problem is that those wobbly effects added to the mood of that debut album. Without them it makes these songs feel way too serious. Way too high school talent show. ""Think of the Ocean"" starts out with some weird noises and wobbly square waves before a lilting (processed)cello comes in and Remiddi brings on a melancholy vocal delivery. It's kind of a downer opening. Reminiscent of a Depeche Mode b-side. ""Cluster"" is decent enough, almost sounding like Explosions in the Sky at the very beginning with the e-bow'd guitar. The chorus brings to mind some of the more longing moments of Strange Weekend. There's still that great production that Mauro Remiddi excelled at last time around, it's just that these songs aren't all that interesting. ""Night Birds"" for example is really just, well, it's just not that good. This is schmaltzy soft rock with modern production squiggles to make it sound relevant. There's even moments where Remiddi's voice wavers uncomfortably, like someone who's fighting the urge to get sick while singing at a karaoke bar. ""I Lost Connection"" takes the cake, though. It starts out sounding like Bob Seger's ""We've Got Tonight"" and then proceeds to plod through nearly six minutes of piano bar balladry. ""The Way Out"" is interesting enough. It dirties up the ears a bit with a overblown drum beat and guitars hanging in the background. Remiddi's voice is more an instrument instead of a focal point, which I think works in his favor.I try to look for the good in everything. I really do. Unfortunately this album is just an overall letdown from the beginning. Some of that magic from 2012 is sprinkled here and there, but for the most part it can't save a drab listening experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZWQZ9B0MSPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ4JVGI#wasThisHelpful","R3TZWQZ9B0MSPA","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a longtime fan of Kevin Barnes and his band of merry pranksters known as Of Montreal, then you also know that the guy changes up his sound about every three months. It seems that within just a month or two of releasing a record that he's giving an interview saying he's going in a completely different direction with the next album. Barnes has done twee pop/folk, Beatles-esque 60s pop, confessional lo-fi indie electronic, 70s funk, and even modern avante garde classical. They're all hats that have oddly enough fit his head pretty well(some better than others.) After last year's dense and difficult Paralytic Stalks Barnes decided to get back to basics with Of Montreal and go with some late-60s rock n' roll. The result is Lousy With Sylvianbriar, an album filled with touches of Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and of course Of Montreal.Barnes is the indie rock Prince. He can play pretty much anything, and has recorded all of the Of Montreal albums by himself since the mid-2000s. Lousy With Sylvianbriar is different in that Barnes went into the studio and recorded live with a full band, and recorded straight to tape. The results are stunning. There's a crispness to the tracks that hasn't been there in the past. Opener ""Fugitive Air"" is a rowdy rock n' roll number that would've fit just right on Exile On Main Street. On last year's Paralytic Stalks the highlight track was the sublime ""Wintered Debts"", which featured pedal steel guitar. The pedal steel must've made an impression on Barnes as the instrument is scattered throughout Lousy With Sylvianbriar with great results. There's an air of dirtied up rock n' roll, courtesy of Muscle Shoals on this album. ""Obsidian Currents"" feels like an old school soul number with electric piano and some great walking bass parts that allow for Barnes to get his soul man on. ""Belle Glade Missionaries"" has a great groove and some of Barnes great wordplay that usually makes no sense but it sounds wonderful. ""The blade missionaries are here to steal your cocaine/You better send your malaria to puncture their brains/ and Send them back to where they came from/Send them back to the souvenirs of disease."" Barnes is never short on vernacular eccentricities. Take the mud stomp of ""Hegira Emigre"", one of the grittiest tracks Of Montreal has commited to tape yet. Barnes sings ""If you're thinking I'm caucasian well I'm actually gray/I was conceived on Ash Wednesday and stoned on Christmas Day"" as the band gives him a rhythm to spit his attitude into the air.Kevin Barnes has made his loosest album yet, all the while never hanging up any of Of Montreal's eccentricities that have made them such a startlingly original band. He seems to have just needed a breather from creating bizarre characters and new languages so he could let his inner Mick Jagger gyrate and promenade across the stage for a bit. Another Georgian raconteur did the same thing earlier this year. Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, much like Kevin Barnes, decided to get back to basics and put out a howling, bloodied rock album after a couple years of putting out tightly wound and intricately created albums. Monomania is easily one of the best rock n' roll albums of the year. You can add Lousy With Sylvianbriar to that list as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLC9BFJQJEFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNJ98WG#wasThisHelpful","R3VLC9BFJQJEFS","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dent May isn't shy about his love for Brian Wilson. On 2012s Do Things he showed a knack for creating a musical gumbo that was equal parts Beach Boys and Animal Collective. It was an interesting, and at times quite pleasant listening experience. Having been signed to Paw Tracks the Animal Collective beats and quirks were understandable. But for a guy that was known as Dent May and his Magnificent Ukulele before going with just his name the Pet Sounds sounds were surprising. Dent May has returned from wherever he was hanging out and writing more pop confections and gives us Warm Blanket. Like the title suggests, this is an album of warm, gooey pop tracks that are sure to warm you up from the inside out. The Animal Collective mannerisms pop up here and there, but for the most part this is a straight up pop record that makes no qualms about its unabashed love of AM Gold, honey-sweet sentiment, and even the occasional f-bomb.""Turn Up The Speakers"" brings to mind a young-ish Harry Nilsson and his ""Turn Up The Radio"", albeit a truncated version at just over a minute long before ""Let Them Talk"" comes in and says throw caution to the wind. A sassy little number about not caring who knows who he's in love with. There's still those Panda Bear mannerisms in the whooshing synths, but for the most part Dent May seems pretty solid in his own footing. ""Born Too Late"" has a disco beat and hand claps, bringing to mind Andrea True Connection's ""More, More, More"". Don't let that scare you off as it's great song, and filled with Brian Wilson-lamenting about wishing you were older than you were. ""I can't explain but I'm at that age/I'm born too late"", May sings as the beat goes on. ""Yazoo"" is a lilting ballad, while ""Corner Piece"" brings to mind late-80s/early 90s Adrian Belew. ""Do I Cross Your Mind"" is the highlight of the album. A beautiful, melancholy song that is reminiscent of Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman's Lenny Waronker-produced albums. It also has some Dr. Dog qualities with it's guitar harmonies. ""I was so ordinary till you came around/I had not learned to deal with thoughts that kept me down"" May sings over a song crossed with Memphis soul, Brill Building pop sheen, and a sadsack quality even Elliot Smith would've approved of.Warm Blanket is song after song of pop hooks, peppy beats, and at times a maudlin feel that never brings you down more than makes you sigh as you stare off into the distance. ""It Takes A Long Time"", ""I'm Ready To Be Old"", ""Found A Friend"", and ""Summer Is Over"" all evoke a feeling of longing. A feeling of ""What if?"" These songs are about searching. Searching for love, acceptance, and an ear or two that'll listen. Dent May wears his heart on his sleeve once again, and it's a good look for him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLXWUBF9P5H6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDTY90C#wasThisHelpful","RLXWUBF9P5H6Z","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Diana are a Canadian synth pop band comprised of members of other Canadian bands, though not all are synth pop. That is inconsequential for you to truly enjoy their debut Perpetual Surrender. What is consequential is that you love synth pop, or at the very least occasionally get the itch to listen to Thompson Twins, Missing Persons, Cocteau Twins, or This Mortal Coil. If you grumbled reading any of those band names you may want to just keep moving along. For the rest of us, we're in for a real treat.It starts out simply enough, Perpetual Surrender that is. ""Foreign Installation"" opens with icy synths coming over the horizon before they disappear with the push of an electronic kick drum and Carmen Elle's calming voice croons into your ear before the chorus comes in big and strong like a wave of angst and emotion. This track oozes 80s', complete with some great guitar wankery in the mid section that you'd swear was played on a white Steinberger electric guitar. Here's the thing, like Bear In Heaven(another wonderful band that dabbles in 80s synth fun..albeit in darker corners), Diana makes these songs something unique. They don't just put on the eyeliner and vinyl pants and rock their DX-7s. No, you see they create something that sounds vintage, but vital at the same time. ""That Feeling"" has a dance floor groove to it, but has enough going on in the background that it keeps your ears and legs busy. Title track ""Perpetual Surrender"" sounds like Sade getting it on with Oingo Boingo. Or Was(Not Was). Carmen Elle also brings Annie Clark, aka ""St. Vincent"" to mind with her voice, giving the illusion you're hearing a St. Vincent/Animotion mash up at times. ""Strange Attraction"" should be playing on radios everywhere, instead of Drake or whatever the kids listen to these days.Like I said before, Diana are no stranger to the Synsonics drum sound and icy synths. But unlike a lot of purveyors of the 80s synth pop sound as of late, Diana are giving us really good songs to enjoy with our morning DX-7 fix. No other song on this excellent debut proves that more than the stunning track ""New House"". It delves deeper into less bouncy territory and into more of a melancholy direction. With sparse electronic percussion, faint synth waves and Elle's voice singing ""What do I gotta say to make you wanna stick around?"", as if pleading for a lover to stay. You know, the good stuff. It's a hazy, quiet, and emotive track that could hint at what direction their next album could go in.There isn't a spot on this album I would change. No note I'd move. No mood I'd lighten or darken. Perpetual Surrender is an album to soundtrack summer fun, fall walks, and winter doldrums. Maybe spring cleaning, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13O8REN7LB6QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ4JU5U#wasThisHelpful","R13O8REN7LB6QZ","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've loved The Dodos ever since I first heard their second album Visitor back in 2008. What I heard in their brand of jumpy, manic, acoustic pop made me think of watching a little kid using his imagination to entertain himself. Boundless energy, conviction to the task at hand. That task? Well, for that little kid it was making the Hulk defeat Abomination, or Optimus Prime take Megatron out in a desert battle that took place in the middle of my living room. In the case of Meric Long and Logan Kroeber -aka the Dodos- that task was to beat an acoustic guitar and some toms and a kick drum into submission. They made music that had endless energy and bounce, yet underneath that sugar high exterior there was this underlying melancholy in Long's vocals and the melodies he weaved out of his much-abused acoustic guitar. 2009s Time To Die and 2011s No Color continued their progression, finding these two Californians honing their sound to a precise point. Never truly leaving behind that manic propulsion they began with, but integrating more instrumentation(vibes, electric guitar) and guest musicians(Neko Case and the Magik*Magik Orchestra on No Color) and turning up the pop aspect of their songwriting. Now, with 2013 well on its way to its leaves changing, and that little kid donning a Hulk costume for trick and/or treating, The Dodos give us Carrier, one of this years finest records.Carrier hasn't lost all the manic energy its predecessors bestowed upon our ears, but this is more of an introspective record. More introspective and heartfelt than anything Long and Kroeber have done before. The theme of change, transformation, and loss weigh heavy on songs like ""Transformer"", ""Substance"", and ""Confidence"". The death of their close friend and band member(at least in live settings) Christopher Reimer directed where these songs would lead. A word that best describes this album is contemplative. Contemplating the big picture. Why things happen the way they do. There's not anger in these questions. Songs like ""Relief"" and ""Holiday"" while lilt in the air, they aren't mournful or dire. They still hold that child-like wonder that the Dodos always bring to the proceedings. It's just wonderment from a child that's lived a life beyond his years. ""Destroyer"" abuses the toms nicely with Long's new love of the electric guitar giving the song a jangly perfection. ""Death"" is a meditation on loss, mournful and quiet. ""The Ocean"" ends this chapter, expansive and awe-inspiring like its namesake.The Dodos made a record about loss. They did it with grace and love and dedicate it to you. And that little kid in my living room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZSLY3K2MH2SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY1Q70A#wasThisHelpful","R2ZSLY3K2MH2SR","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stuart McLamb is one of the good guys. Like many other indie rock luminaries over the last 20 years McLamb began The Love Language as just a guy recording personal songs in his bedroom. Very personal and emotional, the first Love Language album was a break up album of sorts, filled with rough little pop gems that caught the attention of music listeners in 2009. So in 2010 McLamb got to record in a real studio with a real producer. The result was Libraries, a stunning pop gem that showed McLamb wanted to make The Love Language more than just a DIY project to help him mend a broken heart. The Love Language seem to have no plans of going back to the lo fi bedroom pop they started out making. Ruby Red is the biggest and brashest McLamb's project has ever sounded, but still retains the emotional heft and intimacy that made The Love Language so endearing to begin with.The difference is immediate with Ruby Red. For starters, album opener ""Calm Down"" is a driving chunk of fist-pumping momentum. It's an arena rock scorcher minus the cheesy bravado. Full of immediacy and desperation, it's a stunning track that brings to mind Here We Go Magic's ""The Collector"", minus the Krautrock tendencies. The last minute and a half is a full-on instrumental breakdown, full of cymbal bashing and strings coming to a climactic crescendo. It's stunning, honestly. ""Kids"" follows it with a junkyard stomp pop swagger and a distant reverb that seems to envelop a mini-orchestra in the background. Further down the pike is an almost angst-y track called ""First Shot"", which sounds like something The Walkmen would've written in a more pensive state of mind. ""Golden Age"" flows with more of that Here We Go Magic charm, more so from their 2012 subdued album A Different Ship. ""For Izzy"" is a real treat. It's a lilting pop track full of that southern charm and lovelorn melancholy that Stuart McLamb is so good at. Distant strings, plunked piano chords in the chorus, and ethereal vocal harmonies that put this song in the purple, dusky skies of North Carolina. ""On Our Heels"" has an almost 80s feel, something like Eurythmics gone all southern gothic. ""Pilot Light"" ends the album on a heart-swelling note, all Polyphonic Spree grandiosity and strings ebbing and flowing till the very end.Ruby Red is bigger, for sure. But it never loses the emotional center that has always drawn folks to McLamb's indie pop rock earnestness. The Love Language has given us an album we can all understand.  You just have to listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F33MIFOI8HWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHEL8NU#wasThisHelpful","R3F33MIFOI8HWV","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is it that No Age is so angry about? I keep listening to An Object and I'm wondering who rained on their parade? I mean,No-Age-An-Object they've always had this angst-y vibe about them.  Everything In Between seemed to be the point where they found the perfect balance of angst and rebellion mixed with a pop appeal, all the while never losing any artistic face. It seemed as if their next album would be a shining achievement. Instead, we get An Object.  It's an album that at times hints at what could've been something monumental, but instead it seems to be a line drawn in the sand. If you cross, you enter at your own risk. If you don't, well then you just don't understand, man!""No Ground"" opens the album interestingly enough with a delayed guitar, then a driving bass line. That wall of guitar follows with drums hidden in the background behind muddied sonics. Dean Spunt yells about something. He's angry at ""you"".  Who ""you"" is is anybody's guess. It's a noisy opener that seems to stay in one mode: disenchanted. ""I Won't Be Your Generator"" is a nice surprise. It hints at the greatness of Everything In Between and shows Spunt and Randall less aggravated and more inspired. ""C'mon Stimmung"" is the sort of dream punk anthem No Age are known best for. Much like ""Fever Dreaming"" before it, but somehow wore out sounding. As if these two are exhausted trying to figure out how to write a song unconventionally. There's a back and forth on this album. A back and forth from ear catching to stunted and grating. It's sonically in a grey area. No bright spots or dark corners. Just sort of muted. There are some really great songs, like ""An Impression"", which sounds oddly enough like a lo fi Merriweather Post Pavillion b-side. The aforementioned ""I Won't Be Your Generator"", and ""Running From A-Go-Go"" both are truly great tunes. The latter half of An Object seems to be where No Age decided to loosen up a bit and allow the songs to breathe and grow naturally, as opposed to keeping with some rigid artistic manifesto.No Age wants to spit in the face of convention on An Object, and that's all well and fine. But when you start alienating the ears that have followed you and supported you for so long, well you end up playing to an empty room. Sure there are folks that will adore this record's droning noise and artistic vision. The fellas even went so  far as to make the packaging for the record and ship the ""objects"" themselves, bringing them that much closer to the fans that bought the album. I think that's admirable, I really do. But I'd rather the artist concentrate more on the balance between the art's validity and intent, and less on printing UPS labels. I want to be challenged as a listener and lover of art. I don't want easy entertainment. I want it to grow on me, and there are some songs on this record that I'm sure will grow on me as time goes by. But when you make an album so hard to break into and get to know, there's lots of folks that will just drop it and move on. An Object is an admirable try at an artistic statement. Too bad that statement is so hard to understand at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TC1MRP1Y0XQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI1J680#wasThisHelpful","R2TC1MRP1Y0XQ1","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think most folks know a little something about Liverpool, England.  Well, unless you were born after 1990 or you've been living under a rock for the last 50 years. Either way, here's a little history lesson for the uninformed. Liverpool has given us more bands than just The Beatles. Gerry and the Pacemakers, Echo and the Bunnymen, A Flock of Seagulls, OMD and Frankie Goes To Hollywood called Liverpool home. There have been many others, but you can do a google search for those. Another band that can be added to this list is Outfit. They seem to be pulling from that 80s stretch of bands. Club and pub music, mixed with some of that Kid A electronic pixie dust that gives us glitchy electronic dance music that can also sit quite nicely under the ""alternative"" section at your favorite local record store. Performance is a debut to be reckoned with. It's an album for your ears to savor.If you're familiar with Django Django(not to be confused with Django Django Unchained or Django Django Reinhardt) and their blippy little debut from 2012, then you know the territory Outfit are setting camp up in. But unlike Django Django, Outfit seem to take things a little more seriously. Performance is a more melancholy, introspective affair. There's no Devo-posturing. There's more trip-hop influence here. ""Nothing Big"" sounds like something that could've sat nicely on Amok, had Amok been produced by Brian Eno in 1980. There's that care put into those little aural nuggets that were present on albums like Remain In Light and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. There's a slight maudlin feel as the click-clack beat pushes you to move a little. ""I Want What's Best"" has a four on the floor electro beat and sounds like it could've been a ""Master and Servant"" b-side. There's a definite Django Django feel to this song in the vocal harmonies. Listen, you'll hear it. ""Performance"" has a Depeche Mode sound, until about 30 seconds in then this great thing happens where the song gives us this longing that we don't expect to hear. This song sounds like a band that's been writing for years, with more than a few disappointments and tragedies under their belts. ""Spraypaint"", if you heard it late one night driving home from a few too many drinks, you'd swear it was some long lost 80s band.  You'd promise yourself drunkenly to locate this long lost gem on the internet for further reminiscing. The production is second to none on this album. Filled with crisp, gothic-tinged electro psychedelic pop. Psychedelic not in the sense of ""Far out, man"", but more like ""How more far out can I feel at this point?""  There's a difference, believe me.I will occasionally get in a rut with music. I won't hear anything that tickles my fancy and think there's nothing new worth spending my time and money on. Then, out of the blue comes an amazing debut from a band not satisfied with making the same record everyone else is making. Outfit have made a great debut record with Performance. Filled with the kind of good stuff fans of Atoms For Peace, Brian Eno, Talking Heads, and early 80s alternative lap up like a kitty to a warm bowl of milk, it's the kind of debut that makes you excited about the future of music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4S5UV3A23L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECC8KGI#wasThisHelpful","R2R4S5UV3A23L2","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"White Hills are one of those bands that are pretty much fearless. They've run the gamut on their records over the years fromso you are Sabbath gut busters to spaced-out Hawkwind to Tangerine Dream-esque ambient interludes. And the crazy thing is that they can pull them all off quite well. Their 2010  double album H-p1 seems to have been this monolithic mountain located in some fantastical world of crunchy riffage and droning ambivalence where they checked off everything on the band's bucket list. They seemed to have reached a sonic peak and staked their claim to space rock's crown. What do you do then? Well, you keep on truckin', that's what you do. So You Are...So You'll Be is Dave W and Ego Sensation keeping the momentum going.So You Are...So You'll Be is not breaking new ground, nor is it the band becoming stagnant. It's White Hills taking what they know and telling a new tale. ""In Your Room"" breaks through the ambient weirdness of ""InWords"" with a monster wall of guitar noise and a massive drum track that would make Bill Ward proud. Dave W's sinister whisper of a vocal balanced nicely with the lovely Ego Sensation's Kate Pierson-like vocal howl. It's classic White Hills. ""The Internal Monologue"" is five and a half minutes of droning ambient brilliance. It creates a dream-like state that ""So You Are...So You'll Be"" awakens you from in cranked Marshall fashion. The title track is a barn burner of a song that shows Dave W is spacey, guitar God mode with laser shots swishing by your head in the headphones(a must for this album, headphones). ""Outworlds"", acting as the ""when you hear the beep, turn the page"", brings us to ""Forever In Space(Enlightened)"". Nearly 8 minutes of freaked-out noise and a pulsing rhythm that blows up into an all-out fuzz rocker that helps define the word ""epic"". Dave W's guitar is equal parts garage rock fuzz and black metal dirge, with his vocals going from psychedelic to punk squall. Welcome to the centerpiece, people. ""Rare Upon This Earth"" sounds like flaming seagulls and a fiery ocean scene. A soundtrack to some Utopian B-movie that you get drunk and go see at midnight before the demonic Go-Go girls appear and you can faintly hear Roger Corman laughing in the background. ""Circulating"", another ambient segue, brings us into album closer ""MIST(Winter)"", which is a massive instrumental that brings to mind some of the classic instrumental psyche-exploding moments of White Hills and Heads On Fire. It's a triumphant end to yet another bizarre and beautiful chapter in the canon of White Hills.One of the coolest things about White Hills that they don't stick to a one-note guitar freakout. They keep things interesting and new by mixing up the fuzz boxes with the space echo. The oscillators with the reverbs. Dave W has never been one to do what you think he should do. He does what Dave W wants to do. He does what tickles his fancy, or floats his boat. Fortunately for this reviewer, my fancy is tickled as well, and my boat has set sail for the dark and unpredictable waters called White Hills. So You Are...So You'll Be helps to keep the vessel on a course for spaced-out freaky goodness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R48NM2KEAG15A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENRQYAQ#wasThisHelpful","R48NM2KEAG15A","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How many of you like me were enamored with Franz Ferdinand back in 2004? It's hard to describe, but something about that debut album lit a post-punk fuse in me. I'd just begun listening to Gang of Four and had dabbled in The Jam as well. These cats were just the right modern take on a untouchable music noise that I was just beginning to love. I imagined Ray Davies sounding like ""Michael"", ""Darts Of Pleasure"", ""This Fire"", and the excellent ""Come On Home"" had he been born 20 years later. Alex Kapranos had this mix of snarky ambiguity and genuine sad sackery in his vocals and lyrics on that first album that I thought for sure they'd be spanking other revivalists of the same ilk in years to come. So I wasn't completely correct in that assumption. But I wasn't completely incorrect. You Could Have It So Much Better had these Scottish Orange Juice disciples putting their dance shoes away so they could show some rock machismo. Then 2009s Tonight: Franz Ferdinand was a mix of rock n' roll noise, dance floor strut, and Moog freakouts. Most folks in-the-know would say both of the follow-ups were sorta failures(records sales say differently), at least artistically. I'm not in-the-know.  I'm just a schlub from the Midwest that likes his beer strong, his pizza drowned in cheese, and his dance rock boogie-inducing. Franz Ferdinand have been known to be a bit bitey, rather cheesy at times, and can make this middle-aged white guy want to strut his wares more often than not. Well, after nearly breaking up, Franz Ferdinand have returned 4 years later with Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, and while not breaking new ground have made the best with the fertile soil they've been working for nearly 10 years.""Right Action"" opens up with a familiar funky groove and a Kapranos sneer that tells you we're back in sweaty pub territory. It's a less venomous version of ""Take Me Out"", sped up and some farfisa organ thrown in for good measure. ""Evil Eye"" has a great 80s dance beat to it, with a sound not unlike Madness doing a spy theme. Kapranos and company have taken the great production values of Tonight: Franz Ferdinand and the grittier songs of their debut to make something that sounds crisp and tight, but not overproduced. ""Love Illumination"" is the single and while it's got some cool fuzzy guitar and even a horn section the track doesn't really go anywhere. ""Right Action"" would've been a great single choice. But like I said, I'm just a schlub. ""Stand On The Horizon"" is a nice little ballad that doubles as a dance floor disco burner. ""Bullet"" churns and burns but sorta sits in one gear, but it's got a great chorus.We get a lot of the same throughout the rest of this album. There's moments that shine, and others that sorta sit and wait for your approval. It's sorta sad for me, as in my eyes the Franz Ferdinand that won me over with their angular riffs and snarky storytelling don't need anyone's approval. As long as they do what they do best they'll be just fine. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action isn't going to floor you. I'll admit it, Franz Ferdinand are a guilty pleasure. But guilty pleasure or not, they shouldn't be written off. There's enough here for you to dig your teeth into. And hey, you can go ahead and shake what the Lord gave ya.  It'll be our secret.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33597OMAP2WHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUKTG2Q#wasThisHelpful","R33597OMAP2WHW","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you hear a song like ""Long As The Sun"" -the opener on Medicine's excellent new album To The Happy Few- you don't think that this is a band that has essentially been stored in moth balls for 18 years. You think you're hearing The Beach Boys ran through the Jesus and Mary Chain warpulator. With its woozy harmonies blanketed by buzzing guitars, slightly psychedelic groove, and drums that bludgeon more than move, you don't get ""reunion"" vibes. You get ""we never left"" vibes. And that's just the first five minutes of Medicine's triumphant return.I have to admit, before December of 2012 I had no idea who Medicine was. They were on a soundtrack in 1994. They were thought of as the U.S. answer to My Bloody Valentine(they both start with M!), they were seen staring at their shoes once(they were tying them), and there's guy/girl vocals(I think...umm, other bands have done that, too). But it wasn't until some rummaging through Captured Tracks website and their `shoegaze archives' did I locate this forgotten(ignored) Los Angeles treasure. Out of love for the album cover and title I bought Shot Forth Self Living and realized I'd missed out on something special. This double album was filled with buzz saw guitars, drugged-out dance beats, woozy and manipulated vocals, and melancholy melodies that at the album's core created a subversive guitar pop masterpiece. It felt like Brad Laner wanted to disguise the fact that he loved The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and 60s bubblegum pop, so he buried his interpretations of those classics in a mountain of squealing noise. What he may or may not have realized is that he created something completely new in the process. The Buried Life followed SFSL and honed in on the essence of that new ""thing"" Laner stumbled upon and turned into one of the best albums you've never heard. One more album followed with the original three members(consisting of Brad Laner, Beth Thompson, and Jim Goodall) before they said goodbye in 1995. Fast forward to 2012 and Captured Tracks reissuing those first two albums with tons of bonus goodies. During the process of putting those reissues together Laner, Thompson, and Goodall decided they sort of missed playing together, so they began writing what is now To The Happy Few. This is no money grab. This is no shameless self promotion ploy. This is an album overflowing with melody, noise, and love for creation. To The Happy Few is the real deal.The biggest difference in the Medicine of 1993 to the Medicine of 2013 is that the older, wiser Medicine's production prowess is second to none. Laner has become a producer to be reckoned with. ""Long As The Sun"", ""It's Not Enough"", ""Burn It"" are absolute ear candy. Whooshing guitars ping pong back and forth making your equilibrium feel like jello. Beth Thompson's vocals are much more prominent and less processed, showcasing her wonderfully ethereal voice. And at times Jim Goodall makes Medicine sound like John Bonham drumming with Cocteau Twins. He bashes the skins like a man on fire. ""Holy Crimes"" is an example of how much ground is covered in some of these songs. Starting with a bouncy piano and Thomson singing in what sounds like a bathroom, pretty soon an almost tense melody line emerges before the song literally explodes half way through and the melody returns. This isn't just music;  it's an aural painting. ""Butterfly's Out Tonight"" is one of the most stunning tracks on this album. It's this beautiful soundscape with a rolling drum line that breaks into this driving vehicle for Beth Thompson to give us an incredible vocal melody as Laner gets to give us a mixture of Van Dykes Park and Kevin Shields all in one incredible track.It's useless for me to talk about every track, as every track makes this album what it is. What it is, is pure aural joy. It's three people showing us why we were wrong to not listen all those years ago. This isn't a continuation of what they started in 1991. This is a new beginning to something even better. Forget shoegaze, folks. This is music of the highest order, regardless where your gaze lands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WIF2BLF4EC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCTFMHM#wasThisHelpful","R30WIF2BLF4EC4","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whirr are lumped into that genre we Generation X oldsters affectionately call ""shoegaze"". And while some of my favorite music is lumped into this category, I have to say it's getting used way too much. It's become this generic term used to describe anyone that looks at the floor more than ten seconds in order to engage some swishing, whirly guitar effect, or sings with a hefty amount of reverb on their vocals.This is wrong. This is lazy. This will not be tolerated anymore.These are the same folks that call Mumford and Sons ""indie"". Sure, so were Dexy's Midnight Runners considered college rock? Come on, people. It's time to put your music label maker away and actually listen to the music coming out of the speakers(or earbuds, or whatever). Whirr is a band that has been known to stomp on a swishy, whirly pedal or two. And, there is ample amount of reverb layered on top of those boy/girl vocal swirls. But they are so much more than a ""shoegazer"" band. Around, in its mere four songs and just under 28 minutes proves that.If I had to sum up Around in one word I'd have to say mournful. ""Drain"" is like a funeral procession making its way through the tracks 8 minute length. A mixture of slowcore grind and 4AD gothic beauty, its as if Low discovered Bauhaus' In The Flat Field and had some sort of tortured spiritual awakening. The song's momentum never gets above a downtrodden march through muddy fields, yet the vocals somehow bring a certain distant sunlight to the proceedings. This is not your momma's shoegaze. This is gothic rock at its finest. Robert Smith weeps somewhere for his integrity. ""Swoon"" continues this new path of shaded enlightenment that Whirr have begun. This song is heavy without being...well, heavy. It's heavy in its overall depth of sound. Guitars are cranky and noisy, without shoving it in your face. It's an all-encompassing sound. It envelopes you. On previous albums, such as the Distressor EP and their first full-length Pipe Dreams Whirr hinted at this sound, all the while showing some punk roots in the occasional blast of grizzled energy. But now with Around, Whirr sound like a band with six members. They sound huge, and it's a strangely beautiful thing.  Like a funeral by candlelight. This is the first time with Whirr where I can hear Nick Bassett's former band Deafheaven in the sound of Whirr. Like Deafheaven(especially this year's excellent Sunbather), Whirr create this chaotically beautiful world on their records. One where the starstruck lovers end up together, but die in a fiery car crash. But they die together. ""Keep"" and ""Around"" finish this four song mini-epic as if transmitting from a cavern miles into the earth. The bombast reigned in for a more dreamy finale.If you're looking for something jumpy, peppy...something to get you going in the morning, then check the Warped Tour roster. This is for serious music listening only. It's dark, mournful, dreamy, and quite often a beautiful little masterpiece. Gaze at your shoes if you must.  Whirr is looking you straight in the eyes this time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7AU39E6MGFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYQEPX6#wasThisHelpful","RF7AU39E6MGFS","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, I try to be ""with it"", and ""in the know"".  I want to be ""up to date"" on all the relevant music of today. Even as a kid in short pants growing up in rural Hoosierville I was always buying cassettes at my local record store. If there was some new band everyone was talking about you could be sure I had that in my cassette deck. Granted, being the age I was and my geographical location most of these cassettes were of the hair metal variety. It was 1984 kids. And it was Northeast Indiana. I wasn't listening to R.E.M., Husker Du, The Cure, and Echo and the Bunnymen...not yet, anyways. So as a grown up I'm still trying to keep up on all the relevant indie rock coming down the pike. The early 90s indie rock scene has been raped and pillaged over the last couple years rather dramatically. Some of these revivals have been rather impressive(Yuck, The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, Parquet Courts), while others have not(Tribes, anyone?). Speedy Ortiz is here to show us their own brand of Pavement dance moves and Nada Surf mope. They seem to have all the right moves. All the off-kilter rhythms and interesting guitar lines are there, and with lead singer/guitarist Sadie Dupuis' smart lyrics and biting storytelling they seem to have everything they need to win those jaded indie rock oldsters(old hipsters) approval and love.I'll just say this right off the bat, there's more Polvo love than Pavement going on here. First off, they're too good of musicians to be Pavement disciples. Pavement were sloppy, stoned, and completely oblivious, which is what made them so good. Speedy Ortiz are much more meticulous in their songwriting and structure. Tracks like ""Pioneer Spine"", ""Tiger Tank"", and ""Casper(1995)"" owe a greater debt to albums like Cor-Crane Secret and Without A Sound than they do to Slanted & Enchanted and Bakesale. Dupuis writes lyrics that are more pointed and direct than Malkmus and Barlow as well. She sounds like a less stoned and more world weary Liz Phair. Midway through the album the band hits a three-in-a-row winning streak with ""No Below"", ""Gary"", and ""Fun"" where the band puts down the intricacies and noodling guitar lines for earnestness, melody, and even some emoting in Sadie Dupuis' vocals. Great songwriting and storytelling. ""Gary"" sounds like Pavement once the THC clouds settled and Malkmus decided he was serious about this songwriting thing. Midway through the song explodes into a fuzzed-out wall and things get beautifully noisy. ""Fun"" is short and sweet. ""Criminally twisted, puny little villian"", Dupuis sings over a quick pace and a jangly guitar that blows up into a Polvo-like crush before the song ends as it started. ""MKVI"" ends the album with seven minutes of foreboding guitar noise and a rhythm that plods along. It's a more of a statement than a final song.If you're like me, you tend to just listen to the those indie rock staples of the 90s -Pavement, Dinosaur Jr, Polvo, Sebadoh- as opposed to looking for that fix in current bands with folks in their mid-twenties. Maybe because it makes me feel a hell of a lot older when I'm hearing ""kids"" playing the music of my early 20s. But if you must listen to current bands reviving the golden years of slacker rock, then Speedy Ortiz will treat you right. Major Arcana is a solid listen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36F4R5KNOXGYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQRNM9G#wasThisHelpful","R36F4R5KNOXGYG","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve Gunn's Time Off is like a mixed drink, maybe a scotch and soda, on the front porch after a long day at work.  Crisp fall air, alcohol warming the belly, and a stupid smirk on your face as the stoned-out acoustic grooves wash over you. I say stoned-out, but I'm not sure if Steve Gunn was actually high when he wrote and recorded these songs. That's a presumption I should be careful throwing around, but think of albums like The Grateful Dead's Workingman's Dead, Fairport Convention's Liege And Lief, and even Red Red Meat's Bunny Gets Paid.  These weren't just strumming exercises for the campfire collective. No, these were headier fare that elicited both the breezy scope of simple acoustic songs, yet underneath there was something happening you couldn't quite put your finger on. Time Off is breezy, smooth, and at times strikingly complex, like a fine scotch.Gunn played with Kurt Vile's Violators and there's certainly that ""lazy smile"" vibe in these songs, especially in album opener ""Water Wheel"".  Gunn's voice is a cross between Nick Drake and Ben Ottwell of Gomez;  hefty and full, yet still calming and easy going. Tim Rutilli of Red Red Meat can also be heard in Gunn's wobbly vocal delivery. ""Water Wheel"" is a good place to start with this record as its one you can fall right into and want nothing more than to stop what you're doing and take the trip with Gunn and his fluid guitar. Like Vile, Steve Gunn likes to take his time getting to wherever he's going. They say the trip is more important than the destination, and Gunn definitely likes to take his time getting to any sort of conclusion. This is to our benefit. ""Lurker"" is another light and easy acoustic-driven track, opening up with some great 12-string guitar before the song gets its walking shoes on and takes us on another hike through some groovy acoustical brush. Think Jimmy Page's excellent acoustic work on Houses of the Holy and that would give you a good idea of the territory we're dealing with here.Steve Gunn is more than proficient on the 6 and 12-string guitar, both electric and acoustic. He has a bluesy feel to his solos, yet you can tell he's been influenced by more than the usual suspects. ""Street Keeper"" and ""New Decline"" bring Richard Thompson's more esoteric style of playing to mind, with a hint of slide guitar thrown in to break up the maudlin. ""Old Strange"" brings to mind Nels Cline work;  specifically his beautifully dense and challenging work on his mostly acoustical Coward album. ""Trailways Ramble"" is the 8 minute closer that acts as an acoustical mantra, repeating itself over and over again until you feel you've transcended space and time.Time Off was an album that just sort of snuck up on me. It starts out as a wonderfully breezy acoustic record that sounds well made, by a guy that seems to know his way around a fret board.  But spend a little more time with Steve Gunn's excellent new release and deeper emotions reveal themselves. Hidden truths and worldlier intentions arise song after song. Scotch and soda optional.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYWSC7RMWEYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVSAHIE#wasThisHelpful","RTYWSC7RMWEYA","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jagwar Ma like to mix things up. They like dance music. They certainly love 60s pop. They also seem to enjoy some experimental noise as well. But more than anything I think this very cool Australian duo like to write propulsive pop and dance songs that find a spot in your brain and don't leave. As I sat listening to their debut Howlin I didn't know what to expect. After the nearly 50 minute album was over I listened again.  And again. There's a lot to like. And a few to even adore.I think because of the dance-y vibe that permeates this record there's a lot of talk of the Madchester scene of the late 80s with bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. Yeah, I can hear that. But Jagwar Ma are pulling just as much from modern bands as they are the not-so-modern. ""Uncertainty"" for example, has a propulsive beat with some great harmonies in the background bringing to mind The Ruby Suns and MGMT. It's a club banger with a 60s pop aesthetic floating just under the surface. ""The Throw"" is a trance-like groove that seems to flow right out of the tail end of ""Uncertainty"" and slithers along for over  six minutes of pounding bass and a reverbed vocal that sounds like James Mercer guesting with Disclosure. Then things get very 80s and upbeat with the great ""That Loneliness"". Of all things it starts out sounding like, and don't laugh, Madonna's ""Material World"". But don't worry, Jagwar Ma puts it through their cool rinse cycle and make it something modern and fun. ""Come Save Me"" is another perfect pop confection, showing thatjagwar ma Jagwar Ma isn't just about the dance beats and Panda Bear-isms(though, this song sounds like Panda Bear doing his best Brian Wilson to stunning affect). All pop, gooey, and bubblegum ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"", before fading out on a trance-like groove. ""Four"" sounds like a Django Django remix. ""Let Her Go"" is a tasty piece of British pop and rhythm n' blues. It's all blues swagger in the chorus with enough modern touches to make the song never come across as derivative. I can imagine Noel Gallagher pouting in his stately UK manor, surrounded by his gold chairs and the skeletal remains of John and George wishing he'd written this little ditty. ""Exercise"" is a damn funky song with Midnight Vultures bass all over this thing and what sounds like a Transmissions From The Satellite Heart-era Wayne Coyne singing. This will get even the gawkiest fella wanting to shake his groove thing. ""Did You Have To"" brings the Panda Bear vibe back, while ""Backwards Berlin"" takes the album out on a more ambient, atmospheric mood.Hey, there's nothing here you haven't heard before. 60s pop, 80s drugged-out dance, and pulsating Indie rock ala Animal Collective and Ruby Suns. But what you've never heard is Jagwar Ma's take on all of the above. Howlin is a hell of a debut record, and if it's any indication of what's to come we should be very excited.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUHQ85QGC4DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2DLXHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FUHQ85QGC4DC","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eleanor Friedberger's first words to us on her new long player Personal Record are ""I don't want to bother you"", and I believe her. She seems like the type of gal that would rather keep her business to herself. She seems like more the listening type than the talking type.  Yet, when she gets going on this album -and even on her 2011 solo debut Last Summer- she can talk with the best of `em. Coming from the weird and excellent Fiery Furnace's artsy musical experiments to the Brooklyn musical scene's equivalent to Katrina and the Waves is quite a jump. A jump and musical change that fits Friedberger just fine.There's no seismic shift this time around for Eleanor Friedberger, yet there is a difference. It's more about the pep in her step. There's a decidedly tighter sound to Personal Record. It's more Stax Records than Brill Building. A jumping off point from Last Summer to Personal Record would be Last Summer's ""Roosevelt Island"". That was a funky, upbeat number that would've been the big hit for Christie McVie had it been on Fleetwood Mac or Rumors. ""When I Knew"" is a poppy little number that feels like a great little story song that Ms. Friedberger does so well. The drums are crisper and the guitars hang in the mids which propels the song along like early 80s Motels. ""I'll Never Be Happy Again"" is a middle-of-the-road kind of song that makes you stop and pay attention to the words.  Kinda melancholy, kinda moody, with a great jangly guitar carrying the track along. ""Stare At The Sun"" should be the summer jam of 2013.  Driving, fun, and catchy as hell. Here's proof Eleanor Friedberger has a career after Blueberry Boat and Widow City. It's the only time I've ever heard Tom Petty, Katrina and the Waves, and Thin Lizzy all in the same song. And yes, that is a compliment. ""Echo or Encore"" is a moody acoustic number that brings Wilco's bonus track ""Panthers' to mind, with a slow-motion bossa nova acoustic guitar that gives the track a bit of Brazilian flavor. Eleanor Friedberger proves she can do twang with the best of `em with the breezy ""My Own World"". The album lags a bit in the middle a bit due to some singer/songwriter sleepiness before Friedberger pulls the Hall n' Oates card with the ""Maneater""-like ""She's A Mirror"", complete with a great horn section.  Friedberger really shines when she pushes the energy level up, and there's a lot of great bouncy moments on Personal Record. ""Other Boys"" carries us for six minutes before we reach the end with ""Singing Time"". A beautiful and lilting track that would've been dynamite as a duet with Jim James.  As it is, it's still a damn fine song.Eleanor Friedberger has more than proved that she can make great records without big brother Matthew. Last Summer was a great start to a solo career. It was going to be a hard album to top. Personal Record continues the trend.  Personal Record is Frieberger's personal best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPAX3GTHYJ1LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPGLNW2#wasThisHelpful","RPAX3GTHYJ1LQ","A1HWMU2XORHEI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWMU2XORHEI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really can see nothing but good about these headphones. They are extremely comfy first off. Like, wear them for hours comfy. Second off, they fit well around the head, not too lose and not too tight, and with room either way for heads larger and smaller. Something I was impressed with was the fact that the top part of the ear piece did not touch the top of my hear, unlike other hook headphones (it's amazing how the absence of something can really stand out sometimes). The sound quality, from the moment of pairing to when it needed charged, was superb. It has an extremely high quality sound quality. I'm most pleased with it, it brings out all aspects of the music. It is also really easy to pair, it did not take any time at all to pair, and it has a decent range so I don't have to worry about losing signal if I move a smidgen too far away. This blocks out a large portion of outside noises, which is nice if you are wanting this for sports, because those outside noises can easily become a distraction. Not so with these headphones, they easily handle even louder noises, quieting them to the point they are almost nonexistent. Finally, the volume and the other controls are on the right side of the headphones. I like the fact that I don't have to remember which side has volume and which one powers the headphones, having everything on one side makes it easy to do everything you might to do with your headphones one-handed.Pros:*Comfy*Does not touch top part of ears like most ear hook headphones*High quality sound quality*Easy to pair*Blocks out a large portion of outside sounds*volume and controls all on sideI cannot actually find a single thing that I don't like about these headphones.

"This has helpful tips and tricks for all ages, from starting out making money to actually being in retirement. It gives formulas and numbers (something I love). It also gives ideas on how to save and there were a lot of ideas I had heard of, but there were a few I had never heard of, nor thought of before! So kudos to having new info (at least new to me). The style of writing was really nice, it had a good flow to it, and it kept me entertained, while informing me of all the options I should at least look in to, to see how it might fit in my life. For instance, I had heard of an IRA, and a Roth IRA, but before this, I had no clue what the difference was.

"These tights really are amazing. They fit from little babies to adults depending on the size you get (and the size of the adult). I fall under the (rather) short category, so I still can wear kid's clothes on occasion. These were a little tighter than I expected, but I was happy that they fit me as well as thy did. These feel like high quality tights, and even though I've worn these around my twin toddlers, I haven't gotten a run yet (which is really weird, usually when they look at my clothing it seems to develop some issue).

"So. Many. Little. Mirrors! It's hard to keep up with all of them. There are indeed 25 mirrors that you receive, so the effects that you could create can vary greatly. You could use these to make a shimmer wall, attach them to thick cuts of fabric to make a reflective doorway. I liked putting these along the hallway and areas frequently traveled. They catch the eye, and make the space seem more open, if even for the brief second when you pass by it. The glass is a really nice, clean cut piece of glass (for each piece).

"This is a really nice travel changing pad. I actually decided to leave this at my parents' house though for when the twins are visiting, since it's easier to keep a travel changing pad there then get a larger changing pad or remembering to bring a changing pad every time we go to their house. It is easy to keep clean, which is a nice bonus (especially with two boys). It also folds up into a really compact little bundle, so I don't have to worry about it taking up space when we aren't there. It just tucks right in to the diaper supply box.

"This is a really nice postpartum band. I have a lot of baby fluff that needs supported to help strengthen my muscles. I've tried several different ones now, and this is the most comparable to the one I received in the hospital. However, this one is a lot more customizable than the one that I received in the hospital. It breathes well, even wearing for periods of time I still don't feel like I'm in a sauna. Not only does it not make me uncomfortable with the fact that I'm not sweating like a pig, but it's just plain out comfortable. I still know it's there, but it doesn't dig into me, yet it still supports me. It stretches where I need it most, yet is gentle. I have a rather large scar due to a C-Section with my twins, and that area needs support,but is so sensitive. This has been really nice to wear, even in that area. It's supportive, I actually feel like I'm getting a semblance of stronger stomach muscles with this, if not for the pure fact my baby fat isn't trying to head straight the ground while dancing with gravity. The one thing that I did notice, was that it was a little difficult to take on and off at first, it is a lot more complicated than other belly bands than I am used to. So, there is a learning curve, but once the curve is learned, using this is a breeze.

Granted, half an hour of that was searching for a piece my cat had knocked off the table. In spite of the length of time it took to put it together, I had fun. The instructions were super easy to follow, and even had different colors to represent the pieces, because there were multiple of the same size, just in different colors. I will suggest on the swivel piece, not keeping it closed as you push the pin in, it's not fun (at all) trying to pry the two pieces apart. Overall, this is a really nice Lego building set, it did take a little bit of time, but it is a fully functional toy that I personally put together, although honestly it's probably going to go up in my figurine collection (still rather proud I put it together all by myself without getting frustrated thanks to the awesome picture instructions).

These make bath time quite the fun experience.They grow when wet, so my twins enjoy watching them get bigger (although I do start them to soak before bath time so they can be their max round potential). They can handle a bit of strain on them without popping, so I don't put too many in there during bath time, but the ones I do have held up beautifully so far.

" 1:13 MinsThis is an interesting herb grinder. It's a lot smaller than others that I have used, but because of that it's a lot more compact and easy to take places. It has a magnetic top, where you put the herbs and grind them up. They then go to the middle chamber, and finally any fine stuff goes to the bottom. It's a pretty standard design for a herb grinder, just a lot smaller than I am used to. Size doesn't mean it doesn't work though. It works incredibly well. I love the design for the Mr. Herb, it honestly makes me think of my husband, and I may or may not have called him Mr. Herb a few times in the last couple of days... I like this little herb grinder, it's size is small but its herb grinding abilities is right on par.

" 1:52 MinsThis is a pretty standard mini bike pump. It is a beautiful color, and goes perfectly with my school colors (black n' yellow, black n' yellow, black n' yellow...). It has a really nice look, and it's easy enough to attach. It does take a lot more effort than other pumps I have used, which is why I rate this 4 stars. For convenience though, and the fact that's so lightweight that I can forget it's there, this is a really nice bike bump. It's easy to use, easy to put on and take off, it just takes a while. I do think something like this is good to take with you when biking, flats happening at any time (unless you're 10 feet from home), are a major inconvenience that need to be fixed quickly.

"This is a nice, simple way to bring an earthy feel to your iPhone 6. The case is thin and light, which means you get to maintain the sleek form factor, with the added wood bonus.

"This case is an awesome way to add a bit of flare to your iPhone. The thin and light plastic material is flexible during installation, but firm when on the phone. It also did a pretty good job at absorbing shock in drops in my testing. As for the design, the carbon fiber looks fantastic, and is very detailed. Now one thing I do want to point out, which isn't even about the case, is what's included in the box. Besides the case, you also get an included tempered glass screen protector! These retail from anywhere to 10-15 dollars, so getting one ALONG with the carbon fiber case is huge, and makes this case perfect for flaring up your phone, as well as protecting it.

"This mouse truly blew me away. When it was being shipped, I wasn't expecting much since it was under ten bucks. But after two weeks of testing, I can say I was pleasantly surprised. Starting with arguable the most important factor, comfort, I had a nice experience. The shape of the mouse is very ergonomic, and fits my hand's natural grip. Plus, the buttons are placed to allow a fast, comfortable reach. The two arrow buttons on the side line up perfectly with my thumb, and the two top buttons are a comfortable reach from my pointer and middle finger. Finally, the matte plastic is incredibly smooth and soft, which is fantastic, especially for long periods of use. So overall, the comfort of the mouse is great.I don't have too much to say about the look of the mouse. I personally like it, but it's just going to come down to personal preference.Finally, performance was great.

"Before I get into my review, I just want to talk about my perspective and experience. I am not anywhere near an audio expert or professional. I'm just a techie guy that spends a lot of time listening to experience while working, and was listening to step up the quality of my music. After two weeks of testing, I can happily say, this DAC did so.Before we get into the performance of the device, let's talk about the aesthetics. The unit is constructed out of a sleek, non-reflective black metal thats lets it kind of hide away on the desk, even in plain sight. The unit does have some heft, which is great, because it means the connected cables won't drag it, even if they have some weight. Also, the large volume knob is very nice, both visually and for use. So overall, the unit's design is pretty simple, in a good way.Now, to the important stuff, performance. On my setup, I have a set of speakers, as well as a pair  of studio monitors. I am constantly alternating between the two, depending on the situation in my office. Now normally, both sound great, but with the DAC, they sound AMAZING! The speakers usually have a quiet background static that is barely noticeable, but still annoying. But the DAC completely eliminated the static, as well as gave a boost in clarity and bass. As for the headphones, the DAC made an even greater difference. The headphones now give extreme bass, but are also crystal clear. I never realized there were some background notes in my favorite songs until I used this DAC. So overall, performance was fantastic.In conclusion, this has become an essential piece of my setup, and I don't feel any reason to change or upgrade any time soon. I can easily recommend this :)I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBLSM5VHQLJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7K5UJI#wasThisHelpful","R1WBLSM5VHQLJU","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now ever since I started reviewing technology, I've received and tested A LOT of Bluetooth speakers. But only a few of them have been more durable than the average. And over the last few weeks, the Seedforce S100 has been giving the others I've tested a run for their money.Starting off with design, the speaker even looks durable. The speaker is made of a hard plastic, and features a nice matte black and army green color scheme. Combine this with the various indentations and ridges, and you have one tough looking speaker. Now one thing I didn't expect to find with such a small speaker was an NFC chip. The speaker has an NFC chip implemented on its back to pair to your android phone as fast as possible. And the final surprise I found on this speaker was its weight. I found the speaker to be lighter than my galaxy note 4, which is an incredibly light phone. So overall, I'm definitely impressed by this speaker's design.Another impressive aspect of this speaker is sound quality. The speaker performs great from the lowest lows to the highest highs, and boasts a bass so strong that you can feel it in the air. So hats off to Seedforce for providing such an awesome listening experience.Durability: Moving to durability, this is gonna be the main attraction. The ability to let this float in a pool or bath or any body of water is awesome. It allows you to have the  speaker right next to you while you're swimming instead of blaring it from somewhere dry. Also, the speaker handled drops and scuffs very well.So overall, I absolutely love this speaker. It has a great design, boasts awesome sound quality, and offers a more durability than most speakers. I can definitely recommend picking this up, especially for the price of 30 dollars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U4E9W5QYL8CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W7DHHU#wasThisHelpful","R1U4E9W5QYL8CB","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice, basic case for your iPhone 6/6s. The crystal clear TPU material allows you a fantastic view of the iPhone's fantastic design. However, this is where the case goes from 5-star to 4 for me. The Getron branding on the bottom is very noticeable, and really infringes on the design. For cases like this, I love to see the branding on the side or not there at all as it allows you to get the exact naked view of the phone, with the added scratch resistance. Besides that, the case is great though. The flexible material allows for easy installation as well as great shock absorption, and the $5 dollar price tag makes this VERY wallet friendly.

"This speaker is THE BEST PORTABLE SPEAKER I've tested. Now this speaker has a lot of benefits that others in its class, such as the ability to clip onto a bag. However, there were two huge features that stood out to me on this one compared to others: Sound Quality, and battery life. Starting with sound quality, this thing is POWERFUL. The speaker has tangible bass, which is fantastic, and is rare on most large speakers these days. Plus, the whole spectrum, from the highest highs to the lowest lows, was crystal clear and rich. Any genre I threw at this thing sounded excellent, and it was definitely impressive. Also, battery life has been astounding. I've been testing this for about two weeks, coming up to 5-6 hours of usage, and I haven't had to recharge it once. It's still running off of the charge it came with, and isn't showing any signs of dying soon. This fantastic, because it means you can always have the speaker clipped on your bag, without having to take it off to charge every time.Overall, this is a fantastic speaker. It has the same portability benefits of similar models, but the sound and battery life of much larger speakers. Plus, the $20 dollar price tag is an absolute STEAL.

"This is a fantastic light for several reasons,  but my favorite HAS to be that the light itself is detachable. The light itself sits in wireless cradle, which is what really attaches to the outlet.  this allows you to easily slide the light out if you need to look or your phone, glasses, or the power goes out. Plus, there's two different lighting modes. There's the yellow front light, which has a wider more even light. And then the top white light, which is more direct and brighter. I can personally see clearly with the front one, but for things like reading, that second direct one's gonna come in handy. The other feature I found myself enjoying was the motion sensor. Whenever I get up, the sensor sees my motion and brightens the light. Then, after 25 seconds of no motion, it dims to a darker, more sleep inducing light. I loved this, as it prevented me from tripping on my do several times, haha.Overall, this is a fantastic nightlight that comes with a ton of features, as well as a low price.

"These are fantastic bluetooth earbuds! Starting with design, the green and black looks exceptional, especially with the dominant being black, and then having that nice bright green streak in the center. Also, the curved design of the earbud is the most common I've seen, but for good reason. It's very comfortable, and does a good job of distributing the weight of the buds, even though the buds are pretty light. Moving to the eartips, they are made of the same silicone that you're bound to encounter on most earbuds. It's not a bad thing, I love the eartips, especially since multiple sizes are included. Wrapping up the design, the flat green cable looks great, and is a comfortable length. So overall, great design.Next, the sound quality is very impressive. All across the spectrum, sound is deep and very rich. Plus, you get some nice bass, which has been lacking on others at this price point.

"These are truly unique bluetooth earbuds in several ways, but the main has to be the magnetic earbuds. The two earbuds being magnetically attracted allows for both easy storage as well as some cool functions. Instead of using annoying buttons on these buds, Mpow designed them to pause the music/end the call when the earbuds are pressed together, and to play the music/answer the call when they are separated. This is something I've never seen before, and I think that it's amazing feature.Moving on to design, the eartips have an aluminum front, which I've also never seen before, and I LOVE IT! It make the buds look really nice while in use. Moving down, we have a simple flat cable as well as the in-line mic and remote. It's very rare now to find in-line features on earbuds, so I was happy to see this included.Now, for comfort, I was pretty impressed. The earbuds are very lightweight, which prevents sore ears. And the eartips themselves are very smooth and flexible, which gives them a good fit in your ears.Finally, sound quality was AMAZING! From the highest highs to the lowest lows, sound was rich, and I also got some nice bass. It's some of the best I've heard on buds, which is great.Overall, I can easily recommend these earbuds for all of the previously mentioned reasons :)I received this product from the seller in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QABIRZTBKL02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XM6HXE#wasThisHelpful","R3QABIRZTBKL02","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"elago's L4 Laptop Stand is THE BEST LAPTOP STAND, period. Starting with the material, the aluminum used (at least the silver config.) looks IDENTICAL to the aluminum on my Macbook, which makes the stand seem like a part of the laptop while in use. Also, the angle is very ergonomic, as it allows you sit straight and view your screen dead-on at the same time. One thing though if you don't already own one, is a keyboard is a mandatory accessory for this, as the lip on the bottom hat holds the Mac is very uncomfortable n the wrist while typing. One nice thing though if you are using a keyboard, is that the space underneath the stand allows you to slide it under for neat storage while not in use. This is fantastic, because as a high-school student, I often have to watch videos while taking written notes, and then have to type a summary online. This stand allows me to have the keyboard neatly out of the way when I need to go from typing to viewing, which is awesome. Also, if you like to keep your keyboard out on your desk, you can use the extra space for documents, a USB hub, or anything else you can think of.Now the last thing I love about this stand is how it serves as a cooling device for your laptop. The aluminum material conducts the heat from your laptop away from your laptop, which keeps your computer cool while running high-powered programs. This was great for me as a video editor, as it meant I could work longer without having to shut off the computer to cool down.Overall, this is one of my favorite products on my desk.

"This is my all-time favorite LG G4 case for two reasons: The capacity, and the thinness. The capacity, which is 8,500mah, more than doubles and almost TRIPLES your battery life, which is AMAZING! I was able to get through 3 days off of a single charge,which is fantastic for my on-the-go lifestyle. Now, moving to thinness, in the past when I've tested other cases in this high-capacity line from Zerolemon, they have been incredibly thick, and I have to use a belt holster if i want to carry it around. But the LG G4 case is only twice as thick as the G4. Now that sounds like a lot, but think about how thin the G4 is. Double that makes it just a bit more thick than an iPhone 4. I was happy to see this, as it meant I could get an awesme, high-capacity battery, without needing to carry my phone in a different way. So overall, this is a fantastic case, that is easily recommendable :)I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEFV82Y9WEQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01181ODJI#wasThisHelpful","R1OEFV82Y9WEQN","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are fantastic gloves for all sorts of cooking! I personally grill a lot, and these are fantastic for adjusting what I'm grilling without having to worry about pulling my hand back every couple seconds haha. But other uses I found were handling hot pans or sheets from the oven, and working around boiling water. Plus, the gloves are surprisingly movable for how thick hey are. Now one of the main features I appreciated was the grip. The studded design gives you enhanced grip on pretty much anything, which was awesome. And the final feature I love is how the gloves extend up my wrist to protect from things like flare ups while grilling, or hot oil splashes while working in the kitchen.In conclusion, these are fantastic cooking gloves that I can easily recommend :)I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS242D9CJ2QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014J4JP6C#wasThisHelpful","R1AS242D9CJ2QN","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the perfect car for the person that is beyond cheap toy trucks, but isn't ready to spend hundreds on a professional model. Now I do want to note, this is my first review of an RC vehicle, so bear with me haha. The way I'm going to write this is starting from the outside, starting with the remote, and working our way in.Remote: The pretty basic remote included with the car is very nice. The red and black color scheme matches the car, and the plastic construction makes it very light. The red plastic on the grip is textured, which adds a bit of grip, and the turn wheel is removable for easy storage. Like I said, the remote is pretty basic, so there's not much too say here.The Plastic Cover: The plastic cover is surprisingly nice. The art has a lot of details, one being red flames, which looks pretty cool, especially compared to the plain stripes I've seen on others. It's thin enough to be very light, but thick enough to not break or crack in my testing. The cover is held on through four metal pins, which is one of only two cons I found while testing. The reason it's a con is they are very difficult to remove, which would normally mean they wouldn't fall out while operating. But the front-left pin fell out in a crash yesterday, which was unfortunate. It's not a huge deal, as I just picked up the pin since it was right next to it, but just remember to check for all four pins after crashing. But other than that, the plastic cover is great!The Car Itself: Upon removing the Plastic Cover, we have the bare car. Starting at the front, we have the plastic push-bar, which is surprisingly durable. It's held up perfectly in the hardest head-on crashes with walls or curbs, and is a great feature. Next, we have the front suspension, which like the back suspension, is AMAZING. The car is high enough to fit my whole hand under without touching the bottom, and the suspension allows it to smoothly get as low as the depth of my PINKY away from the ground. This is fantastic, because it means the car can take higher drops than others without an interruption in driving. Also, good suspension means you will have an overall smoother driving experience, regardless of the surface. On either side of the front suspension, we have the front tires. All four tires are very nice, as they are fairly large (which allows them to pass over cracks in the ground) as well as very grippy. I was able to get the car at its top speed, take the sharpest possible turn, and it would not roll like others I've used. Moving back, we have the center piece, which is surprisingly thin, especially since it houses the motor. As mentioned in the description, this motor is top of its class and it definitely shows. The 35mph top speed is AWESOME, and it isn't too loud during operation. Also in the center piece is the battery compartment. Speaking of the battery, the included battery gave me about 5-8 minutes of usage, depending on the speed I was at for the majority of the time, as well as how often I braked and accelerated. This is close to the average for cars in this range, so there isn't much to say. Then finally, we have the back tires, back suspension, and rear push-bar. Also, most of the car is crafted out of very durable plastic, the exceptions being the suspension's springs, and the bottom of the center piece. This is great, because it makes the car lighter, which will result in more air-time on jumps, as well as the ability to hit that 35mph speed.Overall, this is a fantastic car. The remote's great, the plastic cover's great, and the car itself is great. And, the $80 price point makes this friendly to both beginners and professionals. I can easily recommend it :)I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4Y9G1GAF57D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEA78Z4#wasThisHelpful","R2G4Y9G1GAF57D","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my All-Time favorite bike mount for one reason: THE MOUNTING SYSTEM!! All of the other bike mounts I've tested have a multistep process for getting your phone locked in securely, whereas with Getron's, you just connect two pieces and you're done! Plus, the rainproof feature is fantastic, and I've been using it so often, that on rainy days, I'll just use the bag by itself! Other awesome features of this mount is how smooth and easy it is to adjust your phone's orientation, the small profile of the piece on the bike itself, and the price of $22 bucks.

"This is one of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE selfie sticks for about a thousand reasons, but I'll try ti narrow it down to the main few, haha:The Handle: So with so many of the same selfie sticks under different names, it's pretty common for something like the handle to be similar to a hundred other models. However, this is not the case on Mpow's model. The handle is made of a smooth, grippy rubber that is WAY better than the most common type I've used, which is a weird foam that easily slips from my hand. Also, The handle has several little bumps that creates perfect dips for each individual. This makes holding he stick much more comfortable, and also helps with grip. Finally, Mpow also includes a lanyard on the handle, which I've actually never seen on a selfie stick, so I was glad to see it included. So overall, fantastic handle.The Pole: There's not much to say here. the 32-inch pole is sturdy and doesn't bend NEARLY as much as others I've seen.The Clamp: The clamp itself is pretty generic, and I've seen it on a lot of selfie sticks. I""m not saying it's a bad clamp, it holds a wide range of phones very well, it's just generic. But the difference here compared to others is the folding mechanism. When not in use, you can fold the clamp back onto the pole, in order for more compact storage. So compact, that this can even fit in your pocket! I was very happy to see this, ad I hope more manufacturers adopt this.Overall, this selfie stick has a fantastic handle, pole, and clamp. And for $30 bucks, I can easily recommend it :)I received this product from Mpow in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7IXRMUNQWNP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013B1ABGC#wasThisHelpful","R7IXRMUNQWNP3","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice case. Starting with pros, the 4 card capacity is the highest I've seen on a wallet case, which is very convenient. Also, the materials used with the case are very nice and high-quality, especially the plastic leather on the outside, which is similar to Samsung's Galaxy Note series. Finally, it's only $10 bucks on Amazon! Now, a transition to the cons is the thickness. The case does make the phone significantly thicker, but for me, it's SO worth it for the 4 card slots. I only mention this because I know it's a huge deal for some. As for cons, the major one is the connection between the inner TPU case and the folio itself. The only thing holding the two together is a weak glue. It's strong enough to hold, but I feel like overtime, it will loosen and loosen until it eventually falls apart. However, for a ten dollar case, they had to cut corners. So overall, this is a great case, with just one major issue, being the glue. But I can still recommend it!I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCAD9XERLHAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZP2ZZ4O#wasThisHelpful","R3SCAD9XERLHAE","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fantastic iPad Air 2 case! The main thing I love is how it basically turns your iPad into a 2-in-1 computer. The laptop-style folio design makes it seem like a laptop, especially since the keyboard is of laptop quality, unlike most of the ones I've previously reviewed. They keys are fairly large, which means you will make less mistakes, ad the keys are also very tactile, which gives you an overall better typing experience. Plus, the keyboard has special iPad unction buttons, like a home button, brightness adjustment buttons, and media controls. Finally, one of the most unique features I have seen on this case is it's hinge. Like most others, it can fold vertically, similarly to a laptop. However, where this one shines is its horizontal rotation. The piece holding the tablet can be rotated 360 degrees, which also allows you fold the tablet down again the keyboard face up, which is super convenient.Overall, this is a fantastic iPad Air 2 case that really puts a fresh twist on your tablet.

You're able to move the arm vertically, and can rotate the ball head 360 degrees.

But now, with this adapter, I can enjoy the high-quality audio of my speakers without messy cables across my desk, and all I had to do was plug this into the speakers! After that, I just connected to it like a normal bluetooth device, and I was set! Also, one thing Taotronics' model has over others i've used is it's size.

"Now for most of my reviews, I'll do a sort-of summary of  few key points. however, for the W1's, I feel a pros/cons lit will be much ore efficient, so here you go:I'm gonna start wih cons, because if any of these are deal beakers, then you can just stop reading here:Cons:-The volume of each bud is not equal. The left is a bit louder, so it sounds like the audio isn't centered, which is really annoying.-The size of the buds themselves is a bit too big for my average-sized ears, and made them extremely uncomfortable 20 minutes into using them.Now those are the only two cons, but both are pretty huge in my opinion, and that's why the buds have a 2 star rating. Alright, now for the pros.Pros:-Color Scheme: The black and yellow is very unique, and looks great in my opinion.-The Cable: The cable is braided as well as wrapped in silicone, which means that the cable will hold up very well over time.-Over-Ear Design: Having the cable run over and around your ears helps prevent them from falling out.-In-Line Mic: Can answer calls without removing your phone from your pocket or armband.-Sound Quality: The internal speakers are very rich and deep, which led them to perform exceptionally.-Price: $16 bucks is an incredibly low price for earbuds.Overall, though these earbuds do have a significant amount of pros, the cons are both deal-breakers for me. I hope iSens makes another generation that fixes these issues, but for now, I can't recommend these.I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4QIU5ZXNVVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112R6O6S#wasThisHelpful","R2L4QIU5ZXNVVK","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my personal favorites when it comes to USB Charging stations for the following reasons:-Design: The matte black with the soft-touch blue looks fantastic on my desk, and the simple, rectangular shape allows me to fit it perfectly in-between my phone dock and my computer stand. But, my only complaint with the design would have to be that it is a bit large for four ports.-Power Output: Now this is where the charging station sets itself apart from others in the market. First, we have two 1-Amp ports, which can be used for iPhones, iPods, Cameras, and other small electronics. Next, we have one 2.4 amp port, which can charge tablets, Android Phones, and other large electronics. Then finally, we have one Quick Charge 2.0 port. Now first of all, I've never seen one of these implemented on a USB Charging Station, so I've got to give AVLT props on that. And second, if you aren't familiar with QC 2.0, a Quick Charge port can charge up a Quick Charge compatible device (such as the LG G4, Nexus 6, and others) at the fastest possible speed, giving you 605 battery in 30 minutes!

"This is  fantastic device! I keep my Macbook Air up on a laptop stand while working, and i didn't want to have a cable running down to a usb hub on my desktop, as it would take up space, as well as look really messy. That's when I came across this little guy, and decided to pick it up. And by little guy, I do mean little. Like the pictures show, this is an extremely small device, bt it's actually even smaller than they depict it, since it is able to fit in the palm of my hand.Another visually appealing aspect of this device is it's construction. The dominant material used is aluminum, which looks fantastic with my previously mentioned Macbook. Also, the rotating feature has been super convenient. When i need to plug something in, I just rotate the hub to face me, plug something in, and if I want the cable out of my sight, i just turn it away from me. It's very convenient, as well as visually appealing to my desk.My only complaint would have to be the speed. I tried plugging my mouse into this, and experienced a lot of lag. This would lead me to believe things like keyboards, usb headsets, and microphones may not work properly through this hub, since they depend on fast reoccurring transfers through the USB port. So things like dat transfer will work fine, but accessories are a no-go.Overall, this is a great hub. It's convenient, visually appealing, and has a sturdy construction.

"This stand is a fantastic accessory to my desktop.My desktop is sort of ""Apple-esque"" with the main colors being aluminum and white. So when I picked up a pair of nice headphones for editing, I wanted a stand that could display them properly, but also match my desktop. Thus, I purchased the H stand.Two weeks later, I am loving this stand! The solid aluminum design looks great with my desktop, which now that I've added ANOTHER aluminum accessory, basically looks like an Apple shrine. And the black padding at the top is fantastic for preventing scratching the headphones. Plus, the base is fairly wide, which has made it my new place to charge my phone while working at my desk. The headphones are held at a good height, my rather large pair being about 3 inches from the desktop (eyeball measurement). My only complaint would have to be that it's lacking a way to manage the cable of the headphones. Other reviewers mentioned wrapping it around the vertical piece, but it looks pretty sloppy. One thing that I think would have fixed this is to have two small pieces protrude from the back of the vertical piece. Then, you could wrap the cable, much like a vacuum cleaner. However, it wasn't a big deal for me, as my cable was detachable, but it's just something i wanted to note.Overall, this is a fantastic stand! It brings a feeling of elegance to any desktop, and looks much better than just setting your headphones down on the corner of the desk. While the $40 dollar price tag is a bit high in today's market, it is well worth it for the elago's signature sturdy construction and premium build.

Alright, on with the review.Starting with the construction, The two solid plastic ends are great to prevent the connectors from breaking off like others I've used, and the center piece in the middle is a flexible rubber that is great when your USB connection isn't equal with your phone. Also, the convenience of always having a cable on my lanyard is FANTASTIC! I didn't think I'd use it a ton when I first got it, but since I am constantly working on different computers, It's super easy to just take off my lanyard and charge my phone off of a computer. Finally, the $25 dollar price tag may seem like a lot. But trust me, it is WELL WORTH IT for the convenience.Overall, this is a durable, convenient cable that I can't live without, haha.

"This is one of the best purchases I've made, period. Having a battery built-in to the wall charger I bring with me anyways is nothing short of FREAKING GENIUS!Starting with design, the black plastic casing is very lightweight, and also very strong thanks to the inner steel reinforcement. The Nomad branding is etched into the both sides with the same black color as the casing, which is great, because it doesn't stick out like a soar thumb. Also, the circular LED indicator on the front is very nice looking. Since this is an 1800mah battery, each third represents 600mah of juice. Speaking of the capacity, 1800mah's will give you one full charge on your iPhone 6 with it powered off while charging. Or if you're charging while using it, you'll get about 50-60%. This is great for when your phone dies when you don't have access to an outlet, and you brought your wall charger with you anyways.Moving on to integration, the way this works is the little white wall adapter that came with your phone slides into the corresponding slot on the back, and the prongs extend from the casing in order to plug into the wall. This is GENIUS, as the battery isn't much larger than the wall adapter by itself.Overall, this is a FANTASTIC buy. The seamless integration is innovative, and the 1800mah capacity is perfect for those unprecedented situations of battery death, haha. Now I know $40 bucks seems pretty steep for 1800mah, but you're not only getting a battery. You're getting a battery that you don't have to worry about remembering, since it's already on the wall adapter you'll bring with you anyways.I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5AZI5JARZ3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKYPDNE#wasThisHelpful","R3H5AZI5JARZ3Q","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This door hanger is AMAZING for my dorm! I needed a place to put my lanyard and my backpack for school, but dorms aren't exactly huge. So I did a bit of looking around, came across this, and ordered it. Two weeks later, I can say it's performed great! It's sturdy enough to hold my backpack full of textbooks, which is great. Plus, it's thin enough on top to not inhibit with my door closing like this other one I owned in high school.  My only complaint, and this is just personal preference, is I wish that the whole wave look wasn't part of it. It just looks weird on my plain door, haha. However, it may strengthen the hanger, which in that case, is worth the look.So overall, this is an easy recommendation, especially for only $9 bucks.I received this product from the seller in order to provide a fair and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHCVIPDIY8H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7CQQA0#wasThisHelpful","RFHCVIPDIY8H4","A3Q4GNGB87LJ32","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4GNGB87LJ32?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I may sound weird but I love playing with this Culinary torch. I am a bit of a food and love to cook and bake! I have wanted one of these for a long time. Not that I would use it all the time, but to have it to use if I wanted to. I use this to burn the alcohol out of a sauce when I am making sauce with Jack Daniels. Its so much fun to use and has so much flame to it! It can go really high and low. I have included pictures to show it at the high and the low setting. It also fits nicely in my hand and is easy to use. It has a safety switch that comes on after you click the flame on and let go of the button which is nice. I have a 3 year old and this makes me feel happy that it has that safety in place just in case I step away from the kitchen for a second if I have been using this. The torch itself looks nice and sleek and I absolutely love using this when I get to use it. I am now looking for more recipes to be able to use this with!

"This is the perfect toiletry organizer. When my husband goes away, he usually takes his plastic shoe box type container with all his toiletries even though he may not need it because he doesn't have anything smaller. This is the perfect size for him. He is leaving for an international business trip this weekend and he put some items in this to see how it would do and he loves it. He loves that it has a spot for his razor so he can take that with him. I love all the pockets and stuff for his soaps and toothpaste and tooth brush. He got quite a bit of stuff in the bag and was happy with how it kept it all organized. He didn't know why the hook was there so I showed him and he thought that was cool.

"This is such a handy trunk organizer. I took a picture (which will be included) of it in the back of my mom's CRV. She has put her car safety items in it so that its easily accessible if she needs it. It makes it so that its blatantly obvious where she has it stored. It has several pockets for putting various items in. I installed it for her and it took no more than 2 minutes to get it in place and secure it. It attached to all 3 head rests and stays put. You can also wrap it around the sides of the seats for more security. If you have a trunk like this, you need this trunk organizer. Its well made and see through so you can see what's in each pocket. It makes it easier to keep things organized as well as up out of the way so that the trunk can be used for other things. As soon as I installed it, she was instantly in love.

"I have been really into branching out and trying new things. First it was cheeses, then it was mustards (random I know), and now its teas. I have been stuck in the rut of just black tea for so long. I have found a couple teas that I like and its fun to try loose leaf teas. There are some loose leaf teas in this pack and they are so good!!!! I am hooked. I have also wanted to try some blooming teas. I have seen them but have been nervous to try them. These are so cool! If you have never tried a blooming tea, DO IT! They are so cool. First they float. Then they sink to the bottom and you start to see little bubbles come out of it. Then little leaves start to open and then before you know it, its completely open and steeping in your hot water. My daughter and I loved trying these. Our favorite was the Snow tea which is also coconut tea. Little bits of coconut floated to the top of the tea. The tea tasted so fresh I was amazed!

"This is a perfect kit if you need mouth guards for multiple things or if you go through mouth guards quickly. I grind my teeth at night and wake up with jaw pain in the morning.

If it does't fit the first time, you can boil it again and start over to get the correct mold for your teeth. You can also trim the mouth guard if your mouth is small. The mouth guard does shrink a little when you first put it into the hot water.

This makes making mixed drinks so much easier and the drinks come out better tasting when they are well combined! I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I have never seen a pill like this before. I have included a picture to show what the pill looks like. The pill is incredibly easy to swallow and has a sweet coating. This has a 2-4 month supply depending on how many pills you take. I have to take more because I live in Oregon and found out recently that I am Vitamin D deficient. I am just getting off a prescribed high dose of Vitamin D to get my counts up. They told me I need to be taking a Vitamin D over the counter now. This is a perfect solution. I need to take 2 pills a day which will give me a 2 month supply of this bottle. It has coconut oil so its absorbed better into my system which I love. This pill is really easy to take and really great for you. I would recommend it if you need more vitamin D. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This charger is excellent for charging your phone quickly if you have a compatible phone. I have an LG G4 and my phone was pretty low on the battery. I put this in and it was charged in probably 30 minutes. This would be great for travel or when you have to be in airports. I keep this in our living room because that is where we are most commonly but I will be taking this with us when we travel since it charges so much faster. I like that the charger itself is compact and I can pull the USB cord out and put another one in if I choose too. That also makes it easier for packing it.

"I have tried many foot files before and most if not all have left something to be desired. This one breaks the mold for me. I absolutely love that this isn't flimsy. You get two of the same foot files in this pack. I took one for me and gave the other one to my husband. I have been doing these foot soaks every so often but didn't have a foot file that I liked or that did what I wanted it to do. This one does. I have been putting baking soda, tea tree oil and hot water in a little bin and soaking my feet for about 15 minutes. This foot file is perfect!!!! It takes the dead skin off my feet without leaving my feet rough afterwards. I like that this doesn't catch the dead skin either so its easy to just dip it in the water to clean it off. It also comes with a bag to hold the files in when you aren't using them. The file itself is durable and strong. The handle has a nice grippy material on it making it nearly impossible for the file to slip out of your hands. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone!!!

"I have really been getting into drinking tea and trying out different teas lately. I like loose leaf as well as bagged teas. I haven't tried blooming tea but that's on my list. When I was given a chance to test out this tea pot, I couldn't have been more thrilled. Its getting colder out which means more hot teas.This tea pot is incredibly easy to use. I like that it comes apart for easy cleaning. We had some friends over so I decided to test this out while they were here. This tea pot holds a lot of hot water/tea. The strainer easily lifts out for cleaning purposes or to fill it. The handle is nice and strong and durable. There is a lid and it sits on top of the area where the strainer is. All of the parts fit together well.I used my Keurig to get the water hot enough but you can boil water and then pour it in. I like that this has its own trivet basically in the form of silicone on it. Then I don't worry about the heat hurting my wood table or anything. It has a cute design and really works well together. It comes with a little microfiber towel that you can sit it on, use for cleaning, or to clean up a spill if you spill a little tea. This whole tea pot is really well made, well thought out and is such a cute addition to my tea products. It kept the tea warm even after it had been sitting for 20 minutes.I would absolutely recommend it if you are looking for a tea pot or drink tea regularly. Its easy to clean, easy to use and works perfectly. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This tea tastes amazing! I have been drinking it the last couple days and am super impressed. It tastes like Oolong to me which I love. I definitely have more energy but I don't get shaky like I would if I were drinking a caffeine drink. I for sure eat less. I drink one of these about 30 minutes before a meal. My appetite is less and I have already lost 3lbs. This tea is easy to drink and leaves a pleasant taste in your mouth. If I was served this and didn't know what it was, I would just think it was oolong tea. I am very impressed with the quality of the product. The tea is easy to steep. I let it steep in the hot water for about 5 minutes. You can drink this tea cold or hot. I have yet to try it cold because its been cold outside and I want a warm beverage but I am excited to try it cold. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The shining is a wonderful fiction and it makes me wish the movie would be re-made and follow the book exactly! The book is well written and Stephen King gives you nice detail on each part he is talking about. His books are easy to read and I would absolutely recommend it if you haven't read this book or any of his others. I have read a couple books and I am no on a third.

"I have been using this water bottle since I got it. I did a little rinse before using it. The only thing I don't like is that it isn't dishwasher safe. You need to clean it with baking soda and/or vinegar depending on what part you are cleaning. Other than that it keeps my drinks cold. I do like that it has two lids. If you don't prefer the straw version you can put the other lid on so you can just unscrew it and drink from the bottle. I have only used cold liquids in this. I like how long it keeps the ice. I only drink water with ice in it. This kept ice in it from the first time I put it in to about 18-20 hours later is when I finally needed to put more ice in the bottle. This is great for taking with you. The straw is easy to drink out of. I would absolutely recommend it if you need a new water bottle. This doesn't sweat if you have ice in it either. I like that.

"I had no clue what these were for when I was given a chance to try them for a review. My husband ended up being my guinea pig. I watched a couple Youtube videos on this and they were very informative. I made my husband lay on his stomach and did this on his back. At first he said it was a little uncomfortable because he has never done this before but before long he said they felt really good. He has had some pain in his back due to a car accident and this is really helping. We will be doing this multiple times a week from now on. These massage cups are incredibly well made and are great for relieving pain. He can't believe that after one time of doing this, his back pain has decreased. They are pretty easy to use and you can always look up techniques on Youtube to help out. I would recommend these if you have any pain at all. This is similar to deep tissue massage.

"This is great to spot clean your car! I mean you totally could if you have the time to do that. This product is perfect for not only spot washing but for winter washing because you don't need a bucket or hose or to be out in the cold if you have a garage. I went out to my car and used this product. I would take pictures but I have a silver car so the pictures didn't turn out to show the before and after. I sprayed it on my car. There is a stream option or a spray. I decided to used the spray and it was a really nice spray. It smells kind of like citrus to me but its very pleasant and not overpowering. I brought 2 rags out. One to clean after the first initial spray, and one to finish wiping it clean. I got so much dirt off my car and it didn't look like there was much to begin with.

"I honestly think these work better than the leading brand of these. The bags are huge and have lots of space. I was able to fit 15+ blankets in two bags and created so much more space in my tiny towel closet. I like that you can use a vacuum but it also comes with a hand pump for travel which is incredibly handy. I just used the hand pump because it was handy but the vacuum is much quicker. I like that the pump screws onto the bag and doesn't come loose until you're ready for it to. Also, I like that when I take the pump off it doesn't let air out. These have given me so much more space in my closet and I am so happy. I plan to do this with summer clothes so I have more room in all the closets and when its summer again I will do this with the winter clothes. I would absolutely recommend it.

"These heel protectors are so soft and so very easy to wear. I put them on and immediately felt a difference in my feet when I walked. I am wearing them with flip flops around the house and they slide a little bit at first but then you get used to them and forget they are there. I can tell there is less impact pain in my heels and it makes walking so much more comfortable. These would fit any foot as they are super stretchy. They are easy to clean when you take them off.

"This is a genius ideas to keep kids and small dogs/cats from getting in between the railing on the stairs. The most frustrating part of this was that the netting was tangled and it took a little bit to get it all straightened out. It was as pretty easy install with everything you need.

My sister got a new puppy and her puppy was getting into the railing and getting stuck. This helped them so much.

"My cheeks have been red since I can remember. The only time my cheeks aren't red is when I am sick. I hate it. So when I was given a chance to try this AHA serum I thought why not. I have been using it for the past couple of days. I wash my face in the morning and evening. Then I put this on my fingers and rub it into my cheeks. It smells kind of floral to me but once its absorbed the smell goes away. It takes a couple seconds for the serum to absorb and my skin is smooth and not sticky after I put it on. I then follow it with a moisturizer. My cheeks are more red in the winter because of the cold so I am glad I got this when I did. I have noticed a reduction in the redness on my face. I like the natural ingredients in this especially the aloe. I will continue using this to help my skin improve and its safe to say that after 6 days I am hooked and will continue to use this especially during the winter.

"This game is surprisingly fun. I didn't think it would be but if you have a bigger group of people the more fun it can be. We have friends over on Friday nights. We play games and have drinks. Fun combo. This game took a little bit to get the hang of but once we did, it got so fun! I would absolutely recommend it. Games seem to be going down hill lately but not this one. Its so fun to play as well as unpredictable. You never know what answers will get shouted out. This can be fun to play while drinking or sober. Fun for all sorts of people.

"We have laminate wood flooring in our house but I wanted some area rugs for decoration. They keep sliding. This is miracle tape. It comes up without leaving an adhesive behind when I pull it up. It definitely keeps the rugs in place so much better. You get a ton of tape at a great price. I was worried it would leave marks on my floor but so far it hasn't. I am super impressed. I also used this under a cord protector that the adhesive didn't work well when we got it. This keeps it in place and keeps me from getting frustrated because the cord cover now stays place!

"These clearvision glasses are very easy to wear and if you need to wear them over your glasses there is plenty of room to do so. The polarized aspect is way more awesome than I anticipated.

The polarization helps a ton and reduces glare so much better than my regular sunglasses. I much prefer wearing these over sunglasses that aren't polarized.

"Perfect cable at the perfect price! This worked great for hooking up our DVR to our TV. Our other cord was starting to fray with all the moving we have done and we needed a new one. This was incredibly reasonable in price. It got to me rather quickly.

"Bluetooth is where its at anymore. I am extremely happy with this bluetooth speaker. I keep it in the shower but if my daughter wants to listen to music while she's taking a bath I stick it in the water upside down and it floats (which she thinks is the coolest thing) and plays music. The speaker is loud and connects easily to my phone. I put my youtube playlist on when I get into the shower and can skip songs, play/pause songs, as well as turn the volume up or down. When its in the shower, it has a big suction cup on the back so it sticks to the shower wall really well. I have been listening to it for a few days now with the battery going strong. This would make a great Christmas, birthday, father's/mother's day gift or a gift just because. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone. I love it so much and how loud it goes is a major plus!

"I have tried quite a few mud masks in my time. I will say that this one is by far my favorite mud mask. It is unlike any other mud mask. When you put it on it isn't mostly water or super cold going on your skin. Its like this really soft mousse like consistency. It didn't get all hard and it most certainly didn't hurt coming off. It left my face feeling so refreshed. I am tempted to put it on more of my body than just my face. Without a doubt, I would easily recommend this to anyone. This is the best mask ever and is so reasonably priced. It doesn't take much to cover your face so it will go a long way. This is definitely a little container of gold.

"I am a bit of a nail polish snob. I will admit it. I have chosen OPI for most of my life and have a ton of them as a result. I do like glittery nail polishes and OPI does have some but not a ton. I saw the reviews on this and decided I would get out of my comfort zone and try a new type of nail polish. I couldn't be happier. I love the price of this 6 pack. Most of the colors I got only need one coat which makes me super happy. I will for sure be trying more colors from this brand as they are now my new favorite nail polish!! I know! I just said that.

"This book gives us a different side of JA Huss & I loved it. The last year of JA's releases have been dark, and Sexy is the perfect light antidote.Fletcher Novak is a male stripper. The kind that has a successful show in a flashy casino and takes home a different woman every night. To his hotel comped suite. Not a bad life. Yet, beneath the surface, there's more to Fletcher. So much more, if you take the time to look. Tiffany Preston, at first glance, appears to have it all. Smart, successful, beautiful. But there's a mountain of insecurities beneath her surface, once you peel back her layers.I love that JA Huss is such a fast writer and we get to experience all these different worlds through her eyes. This book wasn't even on the schedule when the year began. But she pops in to see Thunder from Down Under after a book signing and the wheels turn and before you know it, you've got a new book in your hands, before the year is over.

"My friends are writing glowing reviews for Wasted Lust. Tears, they say. I can‚Äôt finish my review without crying, they gush. Well. I can‚Äôt compete with that. I‚Äôm not a crybaby Smurf. There are no tears allowed in the sphere.Wasted Lust, in my mind at least, has been in the making since Slack. God. Slack. Let‚Äôs revisit, shall we? It was late 2013. I‚Äôd recently shown up on Julie‚Äôs doorstep, looking for Ford.  ‚ÄúHey, is Ford home?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mrs. Ford Aston, Who the hell are you?‚ÄùOddly, this ended with me becoming Julie‚Äôs assistant. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to us either, in case you‚Äôre wondering. Anyway, that‚Äôs how it started and shortly after that Slack released.  ‚ÄúJulie. This girl. She needs a book.‚Äù Visions of Sasha‚Äôs future babies were already dancing in my head.  ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know about that. She‚Äôs twelve,‚Äù she‚Äôd said.  ‚ÄúGod, no. Not now. In a decade so she can have sex. I‚Äôm not reading middle grade.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone wants to read about a grown up Sasha,‚Äù Julie claimed.  ‚ÄúUh, yes they do. I bet she loses her virginity to a CEO,‚Äù I suggest helpfully.  ‚ÄúJana, no. That‚Äôs not happening.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll talk about it later.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve still got to write Taut, And Bomb. And Guns. And there‚Äôs this guy James I‚Äôve had on my mind.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOK.‚ÄùSo clearly, it was happening. We all saw that, right?But whatever. I could wait until the writer agreed with me. By wait, I mean carry on as if it were happening.  ‚ÄúJana, why did a book called Sasha just show up on my 2015 calendar?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat? That‚Äôs a year from now. That‚Äôs more than enough time for you to finish up Ford, Spencer and write an entire series on whomever this James guy is.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deleting this Jana.‚ÄùJesus. You try and organize a person.Then Come Back released and Sasha killed it. Killed. It.This girl, she steals every scene along with your heart. Her book has to happen. I have to know what kind of woman this brave, mouthy child grows into.  ‚ÄúJulie, Come Back was incredible.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI loved it too. I think it‚Äôs one of my favorites.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah. I can‚Äôt wait until Sasha grows up and meets a CEO.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no CEO, Jana.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo what I hear you saying is there is a Sasha book, she just doesn‚Äôt end up with a CEO.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMaybe.‚ÄùHappy. Dance.So it didn‚Äôt happen overnight. I had to wait some. And then wait some more. Julie had other books to write, and Sasha had to grow up. But finally, all my delusional wishing came true. Julie was writing Sasha.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost done writing Wasted Lust. Sparrow Flynn‚Äôs having a Shrike Bikes birthday party.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSqueee! All the squeees! Is Rory there? And Five? I cannot wait for Rory & Five‚Äôs book. I put that on your calendar for 2016 by the way.‚Äù  ‚ÄúRory‚Äôs at the party. Five‚Äôs missing it because the Aston‚Äôs are out of town. But don‚Äôt worry, all the Shrike sisters are at the party.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSisters? OMG. There‚Äôs more?‚ÄùIt was like Christmas, summer vacation and my cat wearing a unicorn hat all rolled up into one. But wait. Could I get one more delusional wish?  ‚ÄúYou know, Julie. Rory could be short for Aurora. Aurora is the first Disney princess.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAre you drunk?‚Äù Julie asked.  ‚ÄúRonnie would name her daughters after Disney princesses. Aurora, Belle, Ariel and Jasmine Shrike. Ronnie would so do that!‚Äù  ‚ÄúLOL.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy are you LOL‚Äôing me? I‚Äôve never been more serious.‚ÄùThen Julie said something even crazier than the delusional happenings in my head.  ‚ÄúI hope you like Wasted Lust,‚Äù she said.Like it? I liked it before she even agreed to write it. I gobbled up every delicious word of Wasted Lust. I got to see what happened to this feisty kid who I fell in love with as a secondary character in previous books. I got to see what happens when you remove a twelve-year old assassin from a secret underground society and send her to grow up in suburban Colorado, complete with a catholic school education. And I got to watch her fall in love, and holy s***, was that worth the wait. Sasha got exactly the man she needed and I loved every moment of her story.5 Smurf filled stars.Note:Wasted Lust is a standalone book that takes place a decade after both the Rook & Ronin, and Dirty, Dark & Deadly series. Sasha appears in those series as a child. This book runs parallel to 321 with a spoiler free crossover between books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SO5G0QBLX8HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BUJC48#wasThisHelpful","R2SO5G0QBLX8HT","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the bundle of Bomb & Guns, the final two books in the Rook & Ronin series.OMFG I don‚Äôt know what to say. There is so much I want you to know. I assume if you‚Äôre reading this review you‚Äôve read all the Rook & Ronin books, because you can‚Äôt just jump in with this book. So you know how great this series is. What you don‚Äôt know yet, is how great this finale is.I know some of you fell for Spencer way back in book 1. I‚Äôll be honest. I was so distracted by Ronin, then Ford that I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to Spencer. He was in this long term relationship with Veronica. He was a biker. Heh.Then I read Bomb. Holy freaking Spencer Shrike. The flashbacks to when he first met Veronica, killed me. Suddenly ‚ÄúI got‚Äù Spencer. His love for Ron the Bomb was the very reason he kept her at arms length. He was never apathetic about her as I had feared. He was crazy about her.Guns picks up where Bomb left off. Spencer is determined to keep Ronnie out of the legal trouble that surrounds the rest of the group. He wants to keep her clueless- and safe. Ronnie‚Äôs had enough of being pushed to the side and I can‚Äôt blame her. Spencer has not clued her in on his plan to keep her safe. He just keeps her dangling & Ronnie is done. I love feisty Ronnie. Veronica Vaughn is a bad bitch and the Team would do well not to discount her. ÔÅä""Veronica,"" he whispers. ""I am the mother******* boss.‚ÄùOh Spencer, yeah you are.""I can't do this anymore, Spencer. You're killing me. Every day you play these games with me, you're killing me. I can't take it anymore. I quit. I quit this stupid f****** job and I quit this stupid non-existent relationship.‚ÄùYay Veronica! See what I mean? She‚Äôs not a doormat, our Ronnie.So, we know Guns is Spencer & Veronica‚Äôs story, but it‚Äôs so much more. All the players are back in Guns.Rook & Ronin are in town. Ford & Ashleigh bought a house. And got two dogs. But there‚Äôs danger too. Ashleigh‚Äôs past is back with a vengeance. Rooks past is about to be put on trial. And there‚Äôs a new guy in town who wants Veronica for something‚Ä¶The interaction between the guys was hysterical.‚ÄúKate,‚Äù Ford flashes me the picture on his phone. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs eating apricots for lunch and she‚Äôs got it all over her chubby face.‚Äù Jesus Christ. I have no idea who this Ford is.This book was like watching the series finale of your favorite show.‚ÄúTell me what else we love, Ronnie.‚ÄùI‚Äôll tell you what we love Spencer. We love finales that bring all our favorite characters back. We love stories that make us gasp and make us laugh. We love HEA‚Äôs and closure.

"Yowza. It‚Äôs the end of an era. The Evan Arden series is complete. I picked up the first book in this series almost two years ago after reading Surviving Raine and being blown away by that novel. I had to see what else this author had available and dove into Otherwise Alone.Evan Arden started as romantic erotica ‚Äì for me anyway. The first novella, with Lia and Evan and the shack in the middle of the dessert? I was hooked. As the series progressed it became far more of a crime series than a romance. Evan dated & killed a hooker. Which, to be fair, Evan killed a lot of people so it‚Äôs not like the hooker was special. Lia came back, and then Lia left again.By this final installment I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. Evan is really disturbed, and this book felt more crime action than any kind of romance. Yet I was invested in Evan and needed to know how this would all end for him. I was kinda wondering if he would even be alive in the end to be honest.I‚Äôm torn on my overall feels for this book. I‚Äôm a romance reader, and it was lacking in romance. I did get the closure I needed with Evan and I got a better understanding of why he would choose to work for the mob.

"If you've read CD Reiss before you don't need anyone to tell you to read this. If you've not read CD Reiss before, this is YOUR book. Shuttergirl is a stand alone romance. It's CD Reiss at her best, all wrapped up & resolved in one novel.Michael is the son of a Hollywood icon. Raised in a life of privilege, under the watchful eyes of everyone. Ten years ago, at a high school for ""the specialest snowflakes money could raise,"" he met a girl. A girl who had no business being there, but her journey through the foster care system included a six month stay with a wealthy couple that landed her in a school district way above her social or educational abilities.They barely knew each other, yet somehow a connection was made between the two. The outcast girl studying on the bleachers after school and the golden boy who stayed late to practice his serve. They made an impression on each other's lives during this brief overlap, so many years ago.Flash forward ten years. Michael is the nicest movie star in the history of moving pictures and Laine is... a paparazzi. But this connection, this thing between them, it's still there. It leaps off the page and for the love of God you two, figure it out.Laine is heroine perfection. She's real and raw and hurt. I want the world for her. Michael is swoony and kind and yet he's completely shut down from fighting for what he wants, instead of what is expected of him.5 huge stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLEA9UQ09NCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSYYB8C#wasThisHelpful","R3OLEA9UQ09NCN","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No one jumps in on book 9 if they haven't read the first 8, unless they live in trollville.So I imagined we were getting a sweet little Happily Ever After with this final book.

Coda is a real book. Gut wrenchingly real. Painfully real.  Honestly real.  And for that, thank you. Because we've all read the swan song finale books that are in the end, not that satisfying. Because we think we want 200 pages of unicorns, but when we get them, we end up kinda shrugging and saying, well that book wasn't really necessary.No one will say that about Coda.

"So many twisty feels...COME BACK picks up where COME left off. James has taken off leaving Harper waiting. Turns out he had an errand to run... in the form of picking up a 13 year old girl from a deserted Colorado prairie, by the name of Sasha. (If you're paying really close attention Sasha first appeared in Slack. She had a scene with Ford while Merc worked out a deal with her Dad.)Sasha will steal your heart before you'e finished the first chapter. She may also steal the entire book.This book is a triangle of confusion. James. Harper. Sasha. Whom should I trust? Who is safe? These three are regularly pulling guns on each other and questioning each other's motives. Sasha seems to have some answers but isn't talking. James is the hero so I should assume he's good- yet I'm not sure what his intentions are. Harper, she's pretty innocent, yet she's not.""What's your tally Harper? How many have you killed? Do you even know?""""I'm not a killer. I don't know why they tell you those things. I'm not a killer.""""I am,"" Sasha says. ""I got four, James. When they came to blow up my grandparents ranch. I got four.""Who are these people? They're twisty, I know that much.There's a romance woven into the suspense as well. Harper was promised to James when she was a child as some sort of deluded payment for a job. Or maybe she wasn't. Maybe the Admiral (head of the secret organization in which this book takes place & Harper's father) has been playing James for a decade. It doesn't matter because now that Harper is grown, James wants her.But.... there's still this lingering feeling....""Things feel off with me too,"" Harper finally admits. ""I can't put my finger on it, but it feels bad.""""That feeling is James betraying you, Harper. And if I was you, I'd definitely listen to that one.""See what I mean about Sasha? Kid gets all the best lines. I'm practically gagging for a Sasha spin off & she's 13.We get some answers at the end of COME BACK but not all, obviously. I wouldn't call this a cliff hanger.

Then in Panic Ford told Rook ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt care about people. That‚Äôs my dirtiest secret and now you have it. I just don‚Äôt give a F about people, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I pushed Ronin off the side of my bed & yelled ‚ÄúMe either Ford! I hate people too! Let‚Äôs cuddle!‚ÄùSo what‚Äôs the attraction to Ford? Ford is a weird guy. A hot, genius, computer hacking, sexy, weird guy. He is the perfect level of weirdness that draws me in.There was so much that made me happy about this book I‚Äôm surprised my digital highlighter didn‚Äôt run out of digital ink. There‚Äôs so many things I want to tell you, but I don‚Äôt want to ruin a single moment of it for you. If you haven't met Ford now's your chance in this bundle deal!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5WAX06KJMR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3ETHBU#wasThisHelpful","R2D5WAX06KJMR1","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsI don't know why I was semi hesitant to pick this one up. I couldn't wait for the release but then I didn't read it right away. Beautiful Bastard was so good. Would this live up? It did.Ansel is a sweet filthy talking man.  He's such a fun free spirit, but dedicated to his career and future at the same time. It was endearing and hot. He's so patient & careful with Mia. Love Ansel!I really enjoyed the premise of this book. Couple meets in Vegas & get hitched. THEN, they get to know each other. All the drunken fun over, things are awkward. It's not an instant happily ever after after meeting one night.Mia's friend Harlow is an interesting character & I look forward to reading her story next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQ1F3EAFXFOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB5WS#wasThisHelpful","R2YQ1F3EAFXFOY","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James, had me at ""What's your name?"" (I would have just told him by the way. James, call me!) Anyway, this new series hits the ground running. Who is this guy?  He's stalking the heroine Harper, there's a lot of she is mine references which I always adore, but... does he know her? Have they met before?Harper is a mess, yet she's strong and smart. She's hiding from something or someone. She's got a past, filled with questionable characters. And she can't seem to shake that James is familiar in some way...What a start to a new series. I was scared leaving the Rook & Ronin gang behind but James & Harper have me fully invested in this new series. The novella is perfect. A perfect intro. Its a full novella, not a short story.

"USE kills it from page 1. Okay, fine, it was on page 2 that I started highlighting. Fiona is missing Elliot and fantasizing about them meeting again. In her fantasy, they bump into each other in a coffee shop and he always takes the time to sit with her. A decidedly tame fantasy from a sex addict, and it guts me.This girl, her pain. She‚Äôs a mess and I can‚Äôt stop feeling for her. Parts of her past are revealed and I‚Äôm riveted. Did she create her environment or did her environment create her?There‚Äôs a triangle here, Deacon vs. Elliott. I see the appeal of both of them, I do. Yet‚Ä¶ Elliot. There‚Äôs just something about him. Bits of Deacon and Fiona‚Äôs past are revealed and he‚Äôs been a lifeline for Fiona, I believe he loves her and would do anything for her. Yet I‚Äôm pinning for Elliot. A man who is unavailable, the repercussions both personal and professional. I do not care.Has the author really given me any reason to be so steadfast in my loyalty to Elliot over Deacon? Maybe not, but I can‚Äôt shake feeling like Elliot wants more for Fiona. That he believes in Fiona in a way that no one else ever has.This story is so much more than Deacon vs. Elliot though. It‚Äôs really Fiona‚Äôs story, the decisions that got her to this place. I don‚Äôt know that life just happened to Fiona. I think she created some of her own problems but that‚Äôs what makes her such an interesting character, one that makes you think and feel long after the book is over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAYS4Y0LG06T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8D5SBY#wasThisHelpful","R3UAYS4Y0LG06T","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So there I was, laying on Shay Savage‚Äôs bed in a hotel room in Chicago with my friend Kristi, as one does upon meeting an author for the first time. It was early May, and rumor had it that the long awaited sequel to Surviving Raine was close to fruition. Shay whipped out her cell phone and showed us a picture of Sebastian Stark while Evan Arden made shots. You think I‚Äôm making this up don‚Äôt you? I have witnesses.Anyway, after a few drinks Shay offered to show us the synopsis to Bastian‚Äôs Storm. Uh, hell yes! Kristi and I bowed our heads together over Shay‚Äôs cell phone to read as Shay watched our reactions. WAIT. What did I just read? Bastian has to play in one last death match tournament? TO THE DEATH? No! This is supposed to be my, I mean Raine‚Äôs HEA. Okay, fine, big breath. It‚Äôs Bastian, he‚Äôll win. Wait‚Ä¶. what‚Äôs the last sentence? He‚Äôs competing against Evan Arden? In a death match?Now Kristi hasn‚Äôt read Evan‚Äôs series, Otherwise Alone, Otherwise Occupied and Otherwise Unharmed. So Kristi is all, ‚ÄúYay, Bastian‚Äôs a badass!‚Äù While I‚Äôm all, ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE PITTING YOUR HEROS AGAINST EACH OTHER?‚Äù This cannot be happening. I love them both. I‚Äôm invested in them both. What kind of sicko battles her heroes to the death? (I‚Äôm looking at you, Shay)My feels are all over the place and I haven‚Äôt even read the book yet. The Evan Arden series is complete. I thought Evan & Lia were living happily ever after. Now Evan is being taken out of retirement to fight Bastian to the death. Only one of them can survive. Shay‚Äôs just crazy enough to do it too.Bastian has trouble accumulating to society, to say the least. He misses the island. Yeah‚Ä¶ the island where they were stranded with no electricity, communication or toilet paper. That island. Bastian goes so far as to suggest that they could go back sometime for a vacation. Clueless bastard.  He struggles with basic societal norms. Being polite to Raine‚Äôs friends, staying sober. And then‚Ä¶ his past comes back with a vengeance.Bastian does make it back to an island, one covered in snow and ice and subzero temperatures. The death match is in a place so remote it‚Äôs only accessible by dropping from a helicopter. The conditions so harsh they will kill you if another contestant doesn‚Äôt do it first.Bastian‚Äôs Storm is less of a love story than Surviving Raine was, though their love for each other is evident. Why Raine puts up with some pretty deplorable behavior is understandable. So how does it all end? Without giving away spoilers‚Ä¶ I can say no more.And okay fine, that hotel room was at an author signing. But it really happened.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EORPS7RWNFCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2LLC0S#wasThisHelpful","R2EORPS7RWNFCM","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally got around to reading this series. Interesting plot twists as always from Alessandra. It was a good break from my normal read. I like the hero to zero in on the heroine early and declare her his. This one takes a while for the hero to get there. Honestly, you'll spend most of the book wondering who the hero even is.

"OMFG I don‚Äôt know what to say. There is so much I want you to know. I assume if you‚Äôre reading this review you‚Äôve read all the Rook & Ronin books, because you can‚Äôt just jump in with this book. So you know how great this series is. What you don‚Äôt know yet, is how great this finale is.I know some of you fell for Spencer way back in book 1. I‚Äôll be honest. I was so distracted by Ronin, then Ford that I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to Spencer. He was in this long term relationship with Veronica. He was a biker. Heh.Then I read Bomb. Holy freaking Spencer Shrike. The flashbacks to when he first met Veronica, killed me. Suddenly ‚ÄúI got‚Äù Spencer. His love for Ron the Bomb was the very reason he kept her at arms length. He was never apathetic about her as I had feared. He was crazy about her.Guns picks up where Bomb left off. Spencer is determined to keep Ronnie out of the legal trouble that surrounds the rest of the group.  He wants to keep her clueless- and safe. Ronnie‚Äôs had enough of being pushed to the side and I can‚Äôt blame her. Spencer has not clued her in on his plan to keep her safe. He just keeps her dangling & Ronnie is done. I love feisty Ronnie. Veronica Vaughn is a bad bitch and the Team would do well not to discount her. ÔÅä""Veronica,"" he whispers. ""I am the mother******* boss.‚ÄùOh Spencer, yeah you are.""I can't do this anymore, Spencer. You're killing me. Every day you play these games with me, you're killing me. I can't take it anymore. I quit. I quit this stupid f****** job and I quit this stupid non-existent relationship.‚ÄùYay Veronica! See what I mean? She‚Äôs not a doormat, our Ronnie.So, we know Guns is Spencer & Veronica‚Äôs story, but it‚Äôs so much more. All the players are back in Guns.Rook & Ronin are in town. Ford & Ashleigh bought a house. And got two dogs.  But there‚Äôs danger too. Ashleigh‚Äôs past is back with a vengeance. Rooks past is about to be put on trial. And there‚Äôs a new guy in town who wants Veronica for something‚Ä¶The interaction between the guys was hysterical.‚ÄúKate,‚Äù Ford flashes me the picture on his phone. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs eating apricots for lunch and she‚Äôs got it all over her chubby face.‚Äù Jesus Christ. I have no idea who this Ford is.This book was like watching the series finale of your favorite show.‚ÄúTell me what else we love, Ronnie.‚ÄùI‚Äôll tell you what we love Spencer. We love finales that bring all our favorite characters back. We love stories that make us gasp and make us laugh. We love HEA‚Äôs and closure. We love epilogues that make us daydream and smile for days afterword.Thank you JA Huss","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BN8ITX26ON6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCJAK96#wasThisHelpful","R2BN8ITX26ON6I","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Reece‚Äôs love helps Bailey deal with her OCD issues, until something happens to send her into a tailspin. She reacts by reverting to the worst of her OCD tics, but worse, she pushes Reece away.

"‚ÄúYou need a man,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA rebound cock to f*** the sad right out of you.‚ÄùSpin is a spin off (ha-ha) series by CD Reiss, but you do not need to read the original series Songs of Submission. Each series is about a different sibling, so we see Jonathan Drazen from Songs very briefly in this book. Spin is Theresa Drazen‚Äôs story.Theresa dated a politician for years. Until he f***** his speechwriter. Being the good girl that she is, she hasn‚Äôt publicly castrated him. Though broken up, she attends events with him, lending her support to his campaign. She‚Äôs torn about taking him back, until Antonio Spinelli blows into her life. Antonio has an impressive cock. But is he rebound cock or something more cock? He‚Äôs all wrong for her. All. Wrong. Theresa is an heiress. Antonio is a lawyer‚Ä¶ with mob ties.Yet, Antonio makes an impression. Early on in the book the simplest line made me grin from ear to ear. ‚ÄúI think I made a bad impression in the parking lot.‚Äù  There‚Äôs just something about this guy. Book boyfriend material that puts butterflies in your stomach and a smirk on your face.Spin is more crime mystery than I normally read, but Antonio was dreamy enough to make this an alpha romance novel for me. You might also like to know that Spin is NOT a serial format like Songs of Submission. The author notes at the end that two more novels are planned for this series, yet I did not feel like Spin ended in a cliffhanger. Do I want to know more? Yes. But the way book 1 ends is almost a mini HEA so you‚Äôre not left hanging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVW3D1AE88K3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXYBR0W#wasThisHelpful","RVW3D1AE88K3K","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Higher is book 2 of 2 in the Indigo Lounge Series by Zara Cox.I stumbled across book 1, High shortly after it was released. The lovely Kitty French featured the first chapter of High at the end of her book, Knight & Day. An endorsement from Kitty was good enough for me so I gave it a try.I love fun, dirty, sexy, alpha books and High delivered.That‚Äôs the first 10%. At 13% the author introduces a term I‚Äôve never heard before. One that will have you grabbing your phone to text a friend and ask, ‚ÄúIs this a thing? Are people doing this?‚Äù I can‚Äôt tell you what it is, well I could, but‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs more amusing if you just read it yourself. Book 1 ends with a killer cliffhanger.Book 2, Higher, starts off where High left off. Zach dropped that bomb on Bethany & s*** gets real. But surely he‚Äôs going to explain himself right? Surely the cliffhanger was a tease and he‚Äôs going to resolve this for us in the first chapter? Nope. He‚Äôs not going to resolve it for us.  He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it at all, actually.  Say what? Bethany, being of sound rational mind, is done.Bethany flees and returns to New York. Zach, in typical alpha fashion, follows her. He‚Äôs still not talking and she‚Äôs still interested.At 72%... Zara Cox delivers again. I had to put the book down & google. I‚Äôm still not sure if that exists. But I‚Äô like one. For my living room.Zach eventually reveals his mysterious secrets, while Bethany bounces on his dick. Okay, fine. That‚Äôs not quite how it happened, but close enough. High & Higher are fun books, with amazing sex. They‚Äôre not the deepest books in the world, and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to be. If you‚Äôre looking for quick sexy reads, these books deliver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2US06BO4YGW7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX4583Y#wasThisHelpful","R2US06BO4YGW7E","A2J7UWRODZ06S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J7UWRODZ06S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I friggin love this series. I've read all 3 & the spin offs.Rook & Ronin is basically wrapped up in 3 books. Rook is a heroine you will fall in love with and not want to throat punch which is important, and more rare than one would think.What I loved about this series as a whole is that each book was better than the last & there's twists & turns in books 2 and 3 that I didn't expect. There's more to Rook that I didn't expect.And then... there's Ford... and Spencer. You meet Spencer in Tragic & Ford in Manic. At first it's like whatever, these are just secondary characters. Then they sneak up on you & you fall in love with them. Yowza. Like I said, twists & turns you don't see coming. Some of the twists aren't for Rook, they're for you the reader. Cause you're supposed to be in love with Ronin, this is Ronin's book... yet you will develop feelings for Spencer & Ford too.The mystery that's woven through the three books- well done. It's a fairly detailed crime/backstory going on but it's explained well so that I could easily follow without confusion. I honesty have no desire to be forced to overthink my smutty books. This series has a great combination of ""wait, what?!"" While still being an easy read.Rook & Ronin's story is primarily wrapped up in this trilogy though they do make appearances in the spin offs. All the characters appear in the final book Guns.

"I honestly applaud anyone able and brave to complete a novel from beginning to end but I won't lie- this book disappointed me. Albeit a welcoming and bubbly event that I'm sure other readers will appreciate and absolutely love, for me The Other Daughter flitted above the year 1927 and sadly danced away from so many waiting opportunities and possibilities to become more than a superficial read with historical accents tossed throughout the pages. The muted romance this novel dipped into never seemed likely and supplied only cloying and lackluster scenes that had me wishing I asked for my hat and bag at coatcheck long before that. I hate to sound harsh but I was really hoping this time, that an author would push this familiar and promising premise to the edge and explore or advance past the predictable and go for the throat instead of patting the reader on the head and then shrugging.I will say I did enjoy the brief pages of complicated relationships, glimpses of the psychological aftermath of the Great War and the beginning chapters. Those parts really shined brightly in this lite read and if only those parts were further explored then I may have been able to ignore some of the above negatives. I must also note sadly in addition to the above mentioned, I could guess exactly how a character would be introduced or described in physical characteristics and speech patterns pages before the main character even met them. Finally the dialogue at times completely ventured out of the setting, era and into silly with Bright Young Things discussing politics, advanced philosophy and bitter social commentary in the middle of corks popping, the shimmy, and saxophones blaring in the background. I blame myself for my disappointment being that I can never decline an invitation to visit this time period even for a few hours and I should have figured what to expect with this novel‚Äôs coverart but I was hoping to find a lot more. I suppose I could recommend this book to those readers who are looking for a quick read that touches on an fascinating time period and has muted undertones of romance with loosely bound secrets and lovely moral lessons but if you are expecting more- you may just want to hold your hat and bag in your lap.___________________________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the opportunity to read The Other Daughter: A Novel","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R822B50DKEFMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF818YY#wasThisHelpful","R822B50DKEFMX","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm always looking for a chance to be swept back to fascinating eras of time and when I first read the premise for Newport I knew I found my next read. Aside from the decadent allure of the 1920‚Äôs, I had the possibility of the appearance of ghosts, s√©ances, ugly secrets and shattering lies of Newport‚Äôs privileged to look forward to encountering. Those aspects alone have so much promise and could create such a spellbinding story that anyone would absolutely love; well not this time, hopefully next time though. Unfortunately, Newport seems to be one of those stories with all the right elements that you are either going to think is marvelous in every way or just shake your head in disappointment and want to forget about. I try not to use the word dull to describe books (even when I didn‚Äôt enjoy them) but I‚Äôm sorry this one was so dull in every facet and turn of the story. Not one of the characters was likeable or memorable and any type of excitement or action was entirely absent until the final 10% and then the novel went into a beyond ridiculous conclusion of events.  Thinking back one last time, what really left me sad about this whole book was the replacement of the much anticipated Gothic tones and thorny mysteries with lackluster romances that carried no believable spark in the passages and held the story‚Äôs pace back even more. Details of the alternating eras were curiously scarce as well and I never received that zephyr of atmosphere that I look forward to feeling when I am immersed in any historical fiction novel. I‚Äôm sure Newport will find its admirers and that‚Äôs great but for this reader the hunt for history and entertainment starts anew and I will be moving on to my next title. I just hope I can report back later with a much more encouraging reading experience._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ * I would like to thank William Morrow Paperbacks and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read Newport: A Novel","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DN4QDT3FCZ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OG9IUAI#wasThisHelpful","R3DN4QDT3FCZ2X","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that The Rival Queens: Catherine de' Medici, Her Daughter Marguerite de Valois, and the Betrayal that Ignited a Kingdom carries and delivers the cache of French 16th-century: betrayals, jealousies, political and religious factions and of course murderous blood relations in its pages but for this reader, I was looking for more history and solid facts versus speculation and less sounding biased views of historic individuals. This was one royalty biography I have been anticipating for months and I very sorry to say, it was a mere disappointing read that I sorely wish I could speak more positively about.Judging by the slew of positive reviews for this work, I seem to be among the few who didn‚Äôt love this book. For me, throughout this title there was a distracting odd informal tone and to be quite honest, I finished having the feeling I was on a much anticipated tour with a guide who at times seemed to take advantage of the unfamiliar visitor only sharing information that avoided certain topics and admissions of personal interpretations while at the same time overemphasizing and repeating thoughts and comments as hard facts leaving no opportunities for debate or questions. Although I did learn about personality and supposed characters flaws and royal scandals while on this tour; it became very awkward to try to decipher what was fact or fiction on certain important subjects and historic figures. This may serve as a perfect introduction through the intricate workings of 16th and early 17th-century French court and politics for someone else but for me I think it best I try to find another guide for this fascinating era of history and key opponents.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18PDUTA626ML9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7X62I0#wasThisHelpful","R18PDUTA626ML9","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first Audible book and what an experience it has turned out to be. I do admit though I wasn‚Äôt entirely ready to travel back to 1893 Chicago with just my headphones.  I also picked up a trusty hardback copy from my local library and followed along with the narrator who had an inviting voice that quite nicely captured this listener‚Äôs attention and the stories of the origin and construction of the World's Columbian Exposition and the truly disturbing and yet spellbinding tale of a psychopath who lurked in the shadowed corners of the bright lights of the Fair. All I can say after finishing is that, I have waited far too long to sit down with The Devil in the White City.With an opening onboard the RMS Olympic in April 1912 and mentions of the RMS Titanic and her final hours; I first settled myself in with a contented smile. It was becoming clear why so many recommendations for this work kept appearing on my lists; interest after interest appeared in these duel narratives in the beginning and I just knew I would fully love this book. As the coupled narratives continued though I noticed that a lot of this work was dedicated to the conception and execution of the World‚Äôs Fair and little about Dr. H. H. Holmes (infamous alias of Herman Webster Mudgett) - the real reason I wanted to sit down with this title. No matter I told myself, it will get better there is a reason they call it THE DEVIL in the White City and see there is another (short) chapter about the insidious serial killer and an unsuspecting victim (and then we come back to long chapters on the Fair). This happened throughout and although I became completely entranced by The Devil in the White City by the ending, I‚Äôm a little ashamed to admit I almost stopped listening a few times due to the over tedious parts/storyline of the World‚Äôs Fair. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this surprising overbalancing narrative choice to focus so much on the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition.Patience was the key to unlocking the underlying sinister doors of The Devil in the White City. The final chapters were chilling, graphic and downright unsettling. Truly not for the faint-hearted and I could see why it was put in the book last (giving the audience a chance to look away at the last possible moment). I have to admit before the final chapters I was ready to quit and give this work an appreciative but solid shove back to the shelves with a low rating but wow what an ending. This whole book was almost like you could dissect these storylines and read about the two sides of Chicago and the Gilded Age of America, I guess it all came down to lady‚Äôs choice and I prefer a darker look at the Gilded Age and The Devil in the White City was worth the wait. I now eagerly look forward to the cinematic adaptation of this narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVNJUWGMHW4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DE6QB#wasThisHelpful","RPVNJUWGMHW4S","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Pinch of Nutmeg is a coming of age journey into Europe's and Eastern 16th-century kitchens that had just enough intrique, court skullduggery and servings of unique history, to keep this reader coming back for more. Told in a distinct fashion that entices with its flavorsome dialogue, colorful assortment of characters and rich descriptions of history; you just may learn something new about the spices, herbs and everyday foodstuffs in your own kitchen pantries. The travels in this book are ones that are sure to delight the culinary curious as we follow a young kitchen boy who dreams of being a master de cuisine. The pages are chocked full of savory and sweet descriptions of period dishes and I will be the first to admit, I had to stop reading once or twice to go and get something to nosh on. Which was perfect because A Pinch of Nutmeg is a paced read and momentary breaks are encouraged to those interested but be sure to come right back because the 16th century topics shared in these pages are just fascinating and a few surprising smacks of drama (in and outside kitchens), counterplots and passion are waiting to be enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed A Pinch of Nutmeg. It had the morsels of trivia I crave to find in my fiction and I thought this was a lucky find. The only negatives I can note are the pacing, a few slips with more modern terms and phrases used but perhaps those are things easily explained by a translation error? For me, I found the mysteries and brief darker tones unfortunately underplayed and simply forgotten as the story moved from one place to another. Finally the romances at times seemed unbelievable and a little silly venturing into a disappointing bodice ripper realm (but again it may just be the translation). Negatives aside, this was a fascinating debut and journey into unfamiliar topics of the 16th century and I look forward to reading more from this author.  I would recommend A Pinch of Nutmeg to readers hungry for a coming of age adventure that also has some surprises waiting for the history and culinary minded.____________________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Amazon Crossing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy A Pinch of Nutmeg.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C4953LJBODFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6S23LI#wasThisHelpful","R1C4953LJBODFS","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a confession: I‚Äôve secretly always wanted to be a Paleontologist but Nursing was the first to accept me, so now I just contently read about portions of ‚Äúformer worlds‚Äù that have and are still waiting to be discovered. I‚Äôm not afraid to admit, I kept my childhood collection of fossils and unusual stones after all these years. That wonder and interest never seems to diminish in any capacity and if you are like me and get excited when a new dinosaur is unearthed and named in the news or still look for interesting rocks when you are in the garden then you will enjoy The Dinosaur Hunters: A True Story of Scientific Rivalry and the Discovery of the Prehistoric World by Deborah Cadbury.In this completely memorizing work Ms. Cadbury takes the reins and invites the reader to take a comprehensive journey into the 19th century and experience: the dawning of incredible discoveries, consuming obsessions, distinct examples of eccentricities of genius minds, unrelenting greed and a New Year's Eve society dinner in the belly of an Iguanodon. You may think that this class of topics would be hard to follow but surprisingly this book captures the reader‚Äôs full attention and explains complicated theories and technical scientific specifics in a very friendly manner that makes this title an absolute joy to read and polished gem for readers that love relics of history, 19th century England and historic individuals you would like to add to the list of answers to that fun question: If you could invite 3 people (living or dead) to dinner, who would you choose? Well after finishing this impressive book, I would be honored if Mary Anning and Dr. Gideon A. Mantell would sit at my dinner table (the third would be Thomas Andrews, Jr. but that name pertains to a completely separate subject of history). The brilliant contributions to the advancement of geology and palaeontology these mentioned two are shown in this title to have given are just amazing and if you have never heard of Mary Anning or Dr. Gideon A. Mantell please pick up a copy or purchase The Dinosaur Hunters: A True Story of Scientific Rivalry and the Discovery of the Prehistoric World by Deborah Cadbury.

"*Please note: there is a US release (Margaret of Anjou) and UK release (Trinity), both are the same books just with different titles.*Last year I read this book‚Äôs predecessor and sadly closed the pages sorely disappointed; I believe I called Stormbird ‚ÄúA non-stop firework show about the Wars of the Roses‚Äù. I honestly didn‚Äôt think I would continue reading this series but something that being the premise or the simple fact that Mr. Iggulden has such a brilliant imagination and can write an entertaining tale tempted this reader to try this sequel and I am very happy I did. Simply, Margaret of Anjou (Wars of the Roses #2) is an encore of history, imagination and characterization that outshines the previous novel.For those unfamiliar with this series, these books are dramatic and colorful presentations of history that surround the dynastic Wars of the Roses- a maelstrom of battles and skirmishes that ensued from politics and progeny that created severe instability in the kingdoms of England and France during the 15th century. For the sake of modern reader, this series of novels seems to push forward the more popular explanation: two houses battling for the crown of England with an emphasis on: premeditated treachery, murder most foul (inside and outside castle walls), court intrigue, consuming greed and brutal dramatizations of battles and wars. Now that may sound negative to some potential readers but if you give this series a chance you just may learn something, create a mental image to attach to names that can be greatly beneficial if you are currently or plan on reading non-fiction works about this topic or simply turn the final pages of these books with a clearer understanding of 15th century English history (even if, it has been a bit amplified and dates and historic figures have been slightly changed for the sake of creative fiction).I will admit that Stormbird didn‚Äôt have much characterization; you only had the good and the bad depiction of characters- no gray was presented in those pages. However, in Margaret of Anjou the main players on the stage of the Wars of the Roses rise for the reader and finally come to life especially: King Henry VI, the Duke of York, Queen Margaret and the Earl of March. There were many memorable moments in this book but I thought the passages and chapters describing King Henry‚Äôs waning strength and occasions of mental clarity were some of the most brilliantly painted scenes in this book. They were fascinating as they revealed a man battling for his sanity, his throne and the love of his wife. Those types of humanizing and revealing portions of the story really made events even more poignant and I‚Äôm happy to share with other readers that the other central characters were painted just as intensely; especially Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York and his son Edward, Earl of March at the very end of this novel. I also noticed that the dialogue was delivered quite differently in Margaret of Anjou versus Stormbird. Gone were the largely jarring modern tones and more-action-less-talk frame of mind of the story to be replaced with stunning and witty banters between characters and some very believable conversations, that play out through these pages completely adding to the joy of revisiting this section of history. Speaking of history, in Stormbird there were some very noticeable anachronisms now I can‚Äôt say that those have been completely torn out (they are still sprinkled here and there sadly) but I noticed less of them this time and the end notes explain in detail the creative liberties that were taken with this novel in terms of dates, actions and should not be overlooked once you reach the end (there are some interesting facts to be found).Overall, this book was music to my ears and I look forward to the finale of this series. The above mentioned positives really shined in this novel and overbalanced the negatives but there were still a few things that I must note for others. The only negatives I found this time were a few anachronistic terms and a sometimes confusing pace of events. Once or twice I had to stop and reread sections to figure out why a certain character was traveling to a city, town or who was attacking which character. I‚Äôm not sure I entirely accepted when the story jumped years and hurriedly moved to another set up for future conflicts; the author does explain why the story did this but I would have liked maybe just one or two sections from those missing years (even if they were views from the common man or woman). The ending was also a little rushed, there is a huge set up and then it is over very quickly versus earlier chapters. That all aside, I still would recommend this novel and ask those who may have read Stormbird and perhaps didn‚Äôt care for it to please give Margaret of Anjou (Wars of the Roses #2) a look- I think you may be pleasantly surprised with this sequel. And finally for those eager new readers just embarking into this realm of intriguing events and strong personalities, I would say get ready for an entertaining performance of history you will not soon forget. Happy reading everyone!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank G.P.

"An intricate dark entanglement of true crime and atmosphere make up this compelling debut that takes the reader deep into a calculated mind and early 19th-century Dublin. The less you know, the better with this novel that may have some twisted surprises waiting for the right reader. A little slow in the beginning but once the corners of the puzzle of the narrator‚Äôs thoughts and reminisces are placed down then this tale takes on an unsettling tone that is hard to ignore. The dialogue and a few scenes also skip occasionally out of the setting and era but the sinister and prolific period details shared in this story pull the eye away from those types of blemishes and slowly reveal a real gem that makes fine reading for those of us who love multilayered thrillers with lasting emotional impressions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34G3QX9XVL5XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO4CWWK#wasThisHelpful","R34G3QX9XVL5XN","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If history and current interpretations of events have taught the modern reader anything, it is that the most dangerous place in England to walk into during the 16th century was the Tudor court. It is depicted as an infamous nest of sharp-tongued vipers and den of hungry wolves that held no guarantee for one who stepped foot into the halls would survive to see another winter or spring. Multiple footnotes and passages of history books support this depiction that behind the pageantry and forced smiles lurked ill-intent and no one be that man, woman or innocent child seemed safe from being deemed an as enemy or the poisoned whispers of gossip that if dripped into the right ears could lead to banishment, imprisonment or death. And it is into these exact harrowed chambers that Watch the Lady takes the reader and introduces us to a figure many may have never heard of before. Her name Penelope Devereux and her journey in this den of secrets, lies and webs of complicated games of power is one that just may garner excitement from different types of fiction admirers alike.Those familiar with Ms. Fremantle‚Äôs novels know all too well what may happen in these pages and be tempted to peek and fully research the names in Watch the Lady before finishing. That is your decision but I personally prefer in looking after and finding that strange or shocking events that were mentioned in these types of stories are actually based on truth and that the author has put the time into proper researching and made the events come alive; but that is just me. I love to be surprised while I‚Äôm reading and in Watch the Lady there were some very fascinating twists and turns but a lot of patience was required on my part to get to those chapters. After reading Sisters of Treason (which I highly recommend) last year and now Watch the Lady, I think it is safe to say that the latter more suited to those who prefer more romance in their historical fiction than other aspects. While Sisters of Treason had all the brilliant characterization and depictions of history that brought the Courts of Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I alive in multiple fantastic ways that kept me turning the pages with a smile, Watch the Lady didn‚Äôt have that effect on me sadly. Among the negatives for me were some details, melodrama (that although clever but at the same time completely unnecessary in many portions of the story) and pacing that just disappointed me overall to find in this novel. Presentations of dialogue (especially Queen Elizabeth I‚Äôs passages) were very laid-back in this novel and there were slips of modern sounding phrases throughout this story that were a little distracting. Finally there was the drama of events by year that never seemed to flow comfortably in this saga and I was really hoping for more chapters that would present the turmoil and unrest in all its facets of the time period.It seems I once again was anticipating too much with this new novel. I did though learn about another player on the board of court, monarchy and political games of England during the 16th to early 17th century and would still like to read more novels from this author; those positives make Watch the Lady an okay read in my mind. Perhaps a little too romantic, paced and a tad overly imaginative with events for me but this type of book may be exactly what other readers are looking for who are unfamiliar with this time period or have just been waiting for the right moment or character to explore history with.________________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Simon & Schuster and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read Watch the Lady: A Novel","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGOC5PD7ZX2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434DPG#wasThisHelpful","R1BGOC5PD7ZX2K","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Closing the cover on this fascinating title, I couldn't help but think about the extreme degrees that current avenues of pop-culture alters and skews lasting impressions of historic figures that deserve to be remembered better. I also couldn't stop berating myself because I'm as guilty as any blithe individual that paid attention to slack and cheap tidbits of ""history"". I admit, for years all I really knew (and really cared to know) about Catherine the Great was far and in between the truth (I waited far too long to learn the actual facts and real history). I wish to foremost apologize for my past ignorance and to strongly encourage any potential reader that may think that particular myths concerning parades of male company and possible equine bedfellows are all there is to be remembered or commented on about this remarkable woman to please pick up or purchase a copy of Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman by Robert K. Massie as quickly as possible.Mr. Massie is a master of his craft and in Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman he deftly shares his extensive research and approaches his subject in a respectful manner that shows why he has earned so many awards for his non-fiction works. In this incredible work he pulls away the embellished myths and rumors to reveal an individual who rightly deserves ""the Great"" forever attached to her name. He also illustrates how such exaggerations and opinions of this historic lady could have been created and spread as he takes the reader to each fascinating stage and event of Catherine the Great's life with richly textured facts and quotes from Catherine's own memoirs and those who personally knew or had the privilege of meeting her before or after the German princess became a grand duchess and finally the Imperial Empress of Russia. It may be a good idea to pace yourself when you choose this book. This biography never means to be quick glossed over read but if you have the time and patience this can be quite the rewarding experience with the trove of minute details and a unbiased view of a truly remarkable woman who changed her adopted country forever and made her stamp in history books concerning politics, art and science.For this reader, I am so happy I finally read this biography. I learned so much and this book allowed me the opportunity to attach a strong voice and clearer picture to a name I have only vaguely read about before. It was also an unexpected surprise to find this book momentarily left details of Russia and ambled down the blood-soaked streets of the French Revolution for a chapter (even going into the mechanics of the guillotine and its continued history and a little about experimentation) but then returned and shared how Catherine reacted and feared the same happening in Russia. Even though I overall enjoyed this non-fiction title, I did find the middle became a bit repetitious with events and it seemed more emphasis was put on Catherine's early life versus her thirty-four year reign but I can see why that would be so (a lot happened that shaped her into the woman she was later to become). I wish there was some sort of glossary of names and a regional map at the beginning (there are so many names, places and titles to try to remember). I was also a little disappointed in the small section of pictures in the back, I was really hoping to see more pictures of Catherine or even a couple of the palaces where she lived at times and couple other names mentioned in this work. Still this is one read I think could benefit anyone who has an interest to learn real facts about Catherine the Great, an important portion of Russian history and even a little about 18th century Europe.Reviewed in June 2015, review written June 2015/ copy of CATHERINE THE GREAT: PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN borrowed from local library","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RERUFFC23XBX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4X9L0#wasThisHelpful","RERUFFC23XBX6","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The more you read about the Johnstown Flood that happened May 31, 1889; all the more profound sadness descends on the events and aftermath of the tragedy. To this day steeped in controversy, the Great Flood of 1889 (or the Johnstown Flood) is widely known if not recognized as the most significant disaster of the 19th century that involved an industrious valley in Pennsylvania that was decimated in under an hour after the collapse of a dam that was at that time serving as a sportsman's lake for the elite and powerful. Immediately many questions and issues jump forward regarding that ill-fated Friday afternoon especially who was wholly responsible for the lose and devastation of so many lives? Were these horrific series of events preventable in anyway? Were there any warning signs before the dam collapsed? With these and other questions in mind, Johnstown Flood by David McCullough takes the reader right back to before and after the disaster and presents both sides of events, letting his audience come to their own conclusions.Alternating between views from on top of the mountain and down below in the valley, the facts flow thick as the author introduces names that are forever attached to that May afternoon. Details concerning weather conditions, social lives, economy, geography etc. are also shared in a paced voice that goes over basically every aspect and topic above and below the South Fork Dam. It may take a little more patience than some are willing to give, but please don't give up on this book because once the foundation of meticulous research is set down then this title can read at times as a riveting novel and finishes quite fascinating and thought-provoking. It certainly felt that way for this reader but I will the first to admit the leaping forward and back of time, subjects and minute facts became a little monotonous and at a few times frustrating but it was well worth slowing down and understanding all sides of arguments by the final page. I will also admit the small collection of maps and pictures placed at the end were somewhat disappointing in this book, but somehow that negative oddly appealed to my love of personal research and I found some amazing photographs and maps in my own search. On that line, it may help those interested to print out a larger period map of Pennsylvania to follow along with the vivid portions of this narrative. The reality of events and magnitude of loss will also become apparent for the reader with the closing pages that many may agree pays an appropriate somber tribute and lists the 2,209 reasons the Johnstown Flood should never be forgotten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKQF1V2DDZKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QTD642#wasThisHelpful","R1FKQF1V2DDZKT","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing I enjoy more than a story that sets me on a journey of research after I have finished reading and reminds me of stories of the old ways and traditions. The Descent of the Lyre is one of those such reads that as soon as I finished, I combed through my resources high and low for more information about European locations, character's names, icons mentioned and details that may be born of imagination or serve as a new piece of trivia for this reader. With this novel I learned about unfamiliar topics and above all was entertained with this tale of music, love, anger and death. With its distinctive expressive flow and setting, this novel felt more as a parable passed down and I could imagine myself sitting in a candle lit room listening to my Baba tell portions of this story. Like the old fashioned ways of storytelling The Descent of the Lyre holds the audience's attention with: religious beginnings, superstitions, dark sides of human nature, near forgotten traditions, love lost, passages of self discovery, moral lessons and regional folklore. As this tale builds this book takes the reader on a journey from small villages at the foot of high mountain passes to isolated religious sites then to the elegance and splendor of Europe's most celebrated cities- with music always in mind, how it can soothe and even transform a lost soul. Finally like the old fashioned tales, there is something to learn at the ending but that message is up to the listener.In the end, The Descent of the Lyre certainly had the historical essentials that are always inviting and enchanting to this reader but I couldn't ignore the feeling this novel seemed oddly rushed towards the end and something was missing to tie off all of the strand-like storylines. I understand the author set the flow of this novel to replicate a dance tempo and indeed it felt at times as so, moving from quick and measured to jumping forward and back taking on different rhythms at any moment with introducing characters and locations, to one entire leap into the future that dedicated the page to the specifics relating to composition research. Although those changes were very inventive and unique, I won't lie, it took me a little longer than I expected to get used to those changes to the pace of the story and unfortunately those creative courses slowed this short book even more for this reader. I also honestly think I missed a few hidden messages in this book, but perhaps other readers will understand and gather from all of the presented passages. Still overall, this was a unique lyrical read that I would recommend to others looking for a music historical inspired parable with Old World charm in the pages, just waiting for the right listener.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FONS74H7SNBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXIJIMY#wasThisHelpful","R3FONS74H7SNBO","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first, but certainly not my last non-fiction title by Ms. Castor. After reading Joan of Arc: A History I have moved She-Wolves: The Women Who Ruled England Before Elizabeth (a title I have been interested in but until now has sat on the lower levels of reading priority) to my list of books to purchase in the near future. If this author can make the complicated machinations and events of the Hundred Years' War and the brief final years of Joan the Maid's life so easy to follow, a joy to read and yet present such a sensitive portrait of legendary figures - I can't wait to see how she presents the sometimes controversial She-Wolves and epic power struggles of English History.Joan of Arc: A History may surprise some readers who expect to read solely about Joan of Arc (or Joan the Maid and later Saint Joan of Arc), her story is a minor section that makes up the wider world that Ms. Castor paints with articulate and confident strokes of chapters that aim to first educate but also directly accompany the reader through the complex events that played out in England and France during the 14th-15th centuries. The pace of this book is swift and the reader may feel a little intimidated with the huge lists of names and titles and how quickly the many battles, skirmishes, underhanded murders and devastating wars play out on and off the blood soaked fields. It's okay to be confused at this point, but keep with this narrative and trust Ms. Castor as she first explains the basic facts of bad blood shared between kingdoms and moves onto the desperate moments that cry out for a miracle for France and then a familiar young girl who claimed heavenly guidance appears in the pages. Some may expect that Joan's appearance come earlier but the author explains in the front of the narrative why she chose to present this timeline. The rest of this title moves to: detailed descriptions of the battles that Joan the Maid led her fellow french soldiers into, her capture, imprisonment, her trial and death. This narrative could stop there, but continues after the ashes of her memory are scattered and goes on to show the impact that Joan the Maid or ""The Maid of Orl√©ans (then later known as Joan of Arc) made in history and shares the words of those who knew and battled beside not just the Maid but the young girl from Domr√©my who believed in something.Joan of Arc: A History handles certain subjects of injustice, complex topics and controversial questions delicately while at the same time allowing the reader to make their own judgments and conclusions. Those portions I really appreciated and I didn't feel at any time I was being forced into any biased moment by the author. The only negatives I had with this book were, I wished more time was spent on certain details and not on others. I also wanted to know more about Joan's personality traits and a little more about her early history before she arrived at the Armagnac Court and perhaps something about her training to be a soldier (how she trained- that must be recorded somewhere). Still this was an enlightening read that I would recommend to others who have been looking for a widely ranged narrative that can take on: Wars, Battles, Fractured Kingdoms, Court and Religious Conflicts and Saints to create another kind of look at legendary figures that is a joy to read.______________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Harper and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy Joan of Arc: A History","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZMHX1PJ6DZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0WUPY6#wasThisHelpful","RBZMHX1PJ6DZB","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1888 London. While an evening journalist plays his fingers across his typewriter and an unfortunate soul of the lanes finds the bottom of another gin bottle, a monster hunts by gaslight and plays his fingers against the belly of a blade in his frock coat. What soon follows will be known as the autumn of the knife and become a part one of history's most notorious mysteries.With a gruesome introduction I, Ripper grabs the reader by the throat and transports them to another place and time. This continues throughout the story as we follow three views that move from a vicious killer, to the thoughts and observations of a bombastic journalist and finally to the scattered confessions and hopes of a voice from Whitechapel. With each one of these switches, the story delves into the depths of the depraved and examines events from August to November 1888 and beyond in graphic detail. A fine flavor of dialogue of the period also follows the reader throughout and only adds to the experience of revisiting Victorian England in all her sordid grandeur. This is truly not a story for the sensitive reader, take this as a friendly warning but then again what kind of story would you expect that involved Jack the Ripper?Although told in a grand fashion that made it nearly impossible to look away from and forget, I am so sorry to say that I was disappointed by the end. At the beginning all I could think was ""incredible presentation of historical details and vintage style storytelling"" but by the middle something shifted and the story began to lose momentum and introduced a complex series of strange tangents that although completely unexpected -it just confused and disappointed me overall in the directions the intricate psychological makeup and explanations of the ultimate motive all went in this novel. The story also unfortunately seemed to weaken in terms of believability as a few chapters moved away from the historic crimes and tried to stand apart but just slipped into an overkill of drama and animated mayhem; leaving more questions than answers by the final page. That all aside, I, Ripper was still very entertaining and the sharing of details about the setting and the journalism profession along with the thrilling cat-and-mouse games throughout this novel were all very nicely done but the ultimate motive, expansion of events outside the crimes and final reveal ended in a whimper. I would still recommend this novel to those who love an old fashioned story that although chilling and grisly in its details, it makes an intriguing reimagined chase across 1888 London that plays with our darkest fears of who and what may be lurking in the shadows watching._____________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Simon & Schuster and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy I, Ripper: A Novel","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQL1SGUOCOA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OR40#wasThisHelpful","R3VQL1SGUOCOA6","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been thinking for weeks about Church of Marvels and what to say about this daringly unique debut. It was certainly something to experience and I do not fully regret reading this book. Like a well advertised show featuring the startling and oddities galore, Church of Marvels is guaranteed to draw crowds of the curious. A few may leave disappointed though and not like all that there is to see in this novel. I see others are in love with this debut and that's fantastic but I seem to be among the few who think this novel was just not for them. It was just a little too out there with the numerous twists and loud ""ta-daa!"" moments throughout the chapters but I did stay until the end.This novel was well researched, daring, atmospheric and lyrical in its approach and with just a little mystery tossed into the story- I couldn't look away from my kindle in the beginning. The setting of 19th-century New York City was presented so vividly and I couldn't stop flipping the pages as the characters navigated through the rapidly changing locales that ranged from down foul alleyways across scenic boardwalks to seedy establishments then to posh homes and back again. From the start this novel reminded me of a few favorite books (The Crimson Petal and the White and The Dress Lodger) with its dark tones and I couldn't stop thinking this title would fit perfectly in a gift shop of a subsidiary of Ripley's Believe It or Not with a few cult movie classics playing on the wall (sorry I won't say which- that would lead to spoilers). The bizarre and fascinating kept the pace moving at an exciting speed and I thought the portions about Blackwell's Lunatic Asylum were some of the best passages in this novel. If the reader has been looking for true harrowing descriptions of archaic medical and mental treatments; you will love Ms. Parry's vivid imagination.So much to love about this novel but after the initial positives, the various strings of shock (and some were very predictable) began to tangle and strangle the suspense and it just moved into negative after negative for this reader. A key portion of the story became lost and left many unanswered questions. Usually that does not bother me, I can usually just make up in my mind a plausible resolution but with Church of Marvels- I had no idea what to think or what would make a good answer. The finale of this novel was also just too much for me but it certainly stayed with the general theme of this novel. Such a shame after a spectacular beginning, still I do look forward to more books by Ms. Parry. This is one author who is not afraid to push past boundaries and leap into the waiting arms of the bizarre of history._______________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank John Murray Press and NetGalley for the opportunity to read Church of Marvels","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4T9TF6CS45B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTSKHWW#wasThisHelpful","RG4T9TF6CS45B","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One glance at an authentic Tiffany Window or Lamp and you will never forget that moment. The artistry is just breathtaking and it is very easy to just stare in wonder at seemingly humble objects that have been transformed into stunning scenes of imagination, nature and biblical themes. It's also easy to see why so many recent fiction novels use the lure of anything featuring ""Tiffany"" and I am among the many who when the words: Tiffany and stained glass or windows, chapels or jewelry are used in the same breath must pick up that new fiction release. Enter Tiffany Girl, when I read this premise I was hoping to love every moment and experience a step back in history with a vibrant cast of characters. Sadly that did not happen this time.Tiffany Girl was just a simple read about a young woman trying to find her place and herself outside her sheltered upbringing in late 19th-century America that also happened to have in the pages a sprinkling of descriptions of famous stained glass windows, pieces seen at the 1893 World's Fair, one lamp, tea screen and a hat pin. And usually that may be enough for this reader; a simple read can be sometimes an unexpected joy to find. I'll be the first to admit this type of story is not my usual (I prefer a much different presentation of history) but it's nice to have a change. I did find a few spots of joy with this novel in the nicely presented religious tones and topics. The imagery of the chapel windows did not disappoint and I had fun looking up gorgeous pictures of the windows as they were mentioned in the story. Speaking of pictures there are some lovely drawings in the beginning of the chapters that showcase buildings of interest, everyday objects found in 1893 and even a few interesting fashion plates. I also appreciated the honesty of the author and the mentioning of the creative liberties with facts, accepted notions and dates that were taken and changed in this novel. Further in the back, there is a wonderful list of the names of the real ""Tiffany Girls"" and their special roles in the creation of the beautiful works of decorative art that can still be seen today displayed in museums, churches and lucky homes.I think what really disappointed me with Tiffany Girl was the main character- I didn't care for her at all. Her childish, intrusive and combative actions had me cringing and hoping the story would begin following any other character but her. The story does follow at times another personality briefly but then goes back to another: crying, bemoaning, heart squeezed or tantrum filled scene with the focal character. The repetitious phrase of ""New Woman"" was a little too much to ignore. It seemed to be within every other page and was mentioned at some very odd moments in this story.Finally I know other readers are wondering if this novel is a strictly clean read and my answer is: I can't honestly say Tiffany Girl is a wholesome read because everyone seems to have their own definition of what that may mean. I can tell you that this story has the expected sugar and niceties but has some surprising spice tossed in. I'm new to this type of fiction but it was certainly unexpected to find two temporary heated scenes in this book. That all aside I wouldn't say Tiffany Girl was a bad book. It may just come down to personal taste, being in the right mood and perhaps frame of mind. So if the reader is looking for a lighthearted skip around the late 19th century with pleasant final messages or a simple read that briefly features the artistry of the Women's Glass Cutting Department of Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company- you found the right book.___________________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Howard Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read Tiffany Girl","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3B2OEUFQDGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451692447#wasThisHelpful","R3V3B2OEUFQDGO","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Life After Life was a fresh and bold story; I can't say I fully enjoyed it. This had to be one of the most frustrating reads I have come across in a long time but I can possibly see where and tell why so many readers adore and recommend this novel. The positives of this book were few for me but are worth mentioning. I thought the life and death struggles pertaining to the civilian lives of the world wars were absolutely gripping and were the best parts of this novel. I can also list among the positives the well painted setting, experiences of temporary joy and a few sinister encounters that peppered the pages.I think what honestly frustrated me the most about Life after Life were the characters (especially the main character) and having the continuing feeling of just watching dolls that would be played with for awhile and then toppled over when their imagined story had nowhere else to go.  It was hard not to feel sympathy and distress toward the main character in the beginning but that gradually faded with each life stage and experience. She became quite unlikeable by the end and that's truly a shame. The repetition of events were handled well in the beginning adding little puzzle pieces that would slowly fit together later in the future chapters but towards the end I started cringing when ""and then darkness fell"" would show up in the pages because I knew the next section would be back to February 11, 1910.  Still overall, not exactly an easy read but one that had its own bright spots of interest for this reader. I may have entirely missed something that others are seeing with Life After Life. It happens, I just hope that D√©j√† vu feeling of disappointment stays with this book and doesn't follow me to the next though.

"This savory historical series continues to claim my attention and to be a solid recommendation to other readers who may have been searching for a literary experience that quickly immerses them into embattled lanes of survival in 14th-century London and beyond the realm. That not only holds brilliantly noted facets of historical research that ties everything together by the final page but offers the chance to follow a shrewd narrator into the very depths of intrigue, greed and betrayal that courses through 14th-century Europe. And believe me when I say, this can become quite the ride if the reader is patient enough to find out what will happen next.In The Invention of Fire, Mr. Holsinger takes us on a fascinating journey that begins with a ghastly discovery of mass murder. The story then slinks into the voice of John Gower who seizes the opportunity to find out the ultimate reasons and motive behind such cruel acts. From there this tale then spreads into the darkest reaches of London to over the guarded gates and walls to the four corners of England and to even across the sea. This is accomplished with a huge cast of characters that range from the genteel standing to ambitious founders, desperate criminals and even a familiar lane of maudlyns makes a brief appearance. With each passing chapter another point of view and distinct locale is visited and where it all leads is whether the reader believes in happy endings or a bleak uncertain future.For this reader, The Invention of Fire was a complex gripping mystery/thriller that although asked for some patience and was a little confusing with the shifting chapters and multiple viewpoints- it was still well worth it by the final page. This was one read that once the foundation of the story was firmly set it became very hard to put down and engaged so many different subjects in a very clever manner. The historical details in this novel were just perfect to set to a murder mystery and it is assured the curious will learn something new about the 14th century. Whether the reader is interested in military history, literary, metalwork, medical or even daily life in 1386, The Invention of Fire (John Gower, #2) has a hidden joy just waiting for you to find. Overall, a fine choice for those readers who love a stand-alone novel chocked full of distinct personalities, gritty realism and a truly intricate plot that could never be considered predictable._______________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank William Morrow and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Invention of Fire: John Gower, #2","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSZ17W85T5Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M714L2S#wasThisHelpful","R2XSZ17W85T5Y5","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""When the Lusitania went down!""- snippets from lyrics from ""When the Lusitania went down"" written in 1915Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy is an informative work that captures multiple points of interest and history regarding the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. At times harrowing and at others a little exhausting but above all fascinating, as this book takes the reader back to a time of a war of nations, empires and acts of human nature and sometimes questionable responses. In the forefront are the details of the last voyage of the RMS Lusitania, the voices of those that boarded and later those that never left her. Above and below the ocean the chapters flow as we continue to follow daily life on the majestic ship and the terror waiting just beneath the waves. Alarm and suspense builds as time slowly moves from April 29, 1915 to the fateful date of May 7, 1915. Passages dedicated to that May afternoon and following days are especially poignant and illustrate everything that could go wrong did in so many ways. Almost a hundred years have passed since that terrible spring day and we still try to explain logically what went so horribly wrong and the reasons why the Lusitania is now resting peacefully at the bottom of the Irish Sea and why we should never forget her story and those brave hearts. The truth is, we may never know all the answers or receive any type of satisfying conclusions to the mysteries of the drama that played out in the background and foreground in 1915.Although Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy was educational and impressive (especially the chapters concerning the sinking and devastating aftermath) I did notice one or two minor incorrect facts and agree with other readers on a few other negatives they have noted including distracting tangents of topics and an obvious bitter tone toward certain figures involved with the tragedy. I did find the before and after accounts about the typical search of scapegoats, political ambitions, espionage and the obvious company loyalty to the Cunard Line very intriguing and the way the book presents these accounts possibly shows why so many conspiracies and mysteries still surround the Lusitania. I also appreciated the valuable photographs throughout this book that really brought events and voices to reality; especially the pictures of the ship, passengers, crew and political figures. Overall, not exactly an easy read with its broad explanations of historic events, deliberate pacing and tragic details but a part of a true story that needs to be recounted for new and future generations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQFMW1AGW5Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802713750#wasThisHelpful","RTQFMW1AGW5Z2","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Graphic in description and creative in overall execution, The Black Tower follows the voice of a young medical student who finds himself pulled from his humble life into a murder investigation that involves the death of an unknown man who is curiously found with the name of the young student on his person. In 1818 Paris murder is common enough in the seamy alleys but when confronted with not only the scrawled name but the additional evidence that the deceased was tortured well that certainly will not do. It is up to the brilliant yet unconventional Inspector Vidocq to discover the motive behind such a baffling crime and with our narrator in tow they soon race into a tangled web of deceit, conspiracies and the chance to rewrite history.For this reader, The Black Tower was an energetic rendition of history that immediately grabbed my attention and appealed to my love of a good conspiracy and political intrigue filled novel. Being more comfortable with recognizing the late 18th-century historic events mentioned, I was vaguely familiar with the early 19th-century French history so it was a great opportunity to learn a new era of history and research the French monarchy and military history as I read. The intricate weaving of passages pertaining to the mysterious events that occurred in a locked room in a tower in 1795 and how they played a crucial part in this novel only added to my list of positives as unsolved questions were explored and expanded in the storyline. Although entertaining this novel did venture into the modern tone a few times with anachronistic terms and crass unexpected phrases that pulled this reader from the story. A few characters were a bit flat with lost potential and scenes toward the end seemed to blur together. There were also a few plot holes in this book that never closed for this reader and finally the mystery and collection of clues seemed forced and too convenient at times. Overall, not a bad selection for a rainy day and I may read another novel by this author. I would recommend The Black Tower to those who enjoy reading about the dark side of history, love a murder mystery and can stomach graphic descriptions of human misery and abuse. This novel may not be for everyone but its energetic batting with the idea of ""what if"" of historical events may be worth your time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9HUO8CFVTKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E70RPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3T9HUO8CFVTKB","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best way I can describe this book to other readers is: think of a cross of The Twilight Zone with a history channel documentary on the court of Charles I and a certain movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (but sadly without the madcap black humor).This novel did have its moments for this reader especially in the beginning chapters that explored the delicate psyche of Venetia Stanley and later when the viper wine made its appearance. To be honest, if this story stayed completely in the historical realm with its fascinating macabre notes and 17th-century English Court drama and out of the irritating post modern walk-ins and the static tangents then I would have enjoyed this novel more. I believe the real life mystery that made up a crucial part of this story is what kept me reading and yes I did manage to finish this. Viper Wine was completely out of the box in terms of anything I have ever read but it also reminded me why I prefer my little boxes of purely historical fiction. Still it was overall daring in its approach and if the reader has been searching for a literary experience that can be truly called unique try some Viper Wine, you just may like it.______________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank Hogarth and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read Viper Wine: A Novel","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1S9DK4SV5GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD314#wasThisHelpful","R3I1S9DK4SV5GX","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Spring finally evident outside this reader's window, I thought Crossing on the Paris would be an appropriate calming selection. Adding to the positives that initially attracted me were the setting that appealed to my absolute fascination with early 20th-century ocean liners and synopsis calling to my love of a fine rich and poor story or in this case an above and below the waterline blend. I really thought this would be a perfect novel for me, one that would completely immerse me in a time period and hold me until the final page. I was sorely wrong.This book rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning to overly sentimental ending. The actual SS Paris had art deco arrangements (sleek and historical charm throughout) and I was hoping this would also flow into this story but it felt choppy and was too lighthearted and restrained for my tastes. The characters were detached and the above and below the waterline acts, thoughts and dialogue came off very modern also the drama stretched believability too far for me being that class passengers and crew members could co-mingle so easily. Finally the ridiculous final resolutions and repetitiveness just had me shaking my head and asking myself ""why did I read this?"". This was clearly an overall mistake for me but at least I now have experience and will be wiser next time (that is what the serious situations and final messages in this novel have taught me). I honestly don't know if I can recommend this book it had potential but I couldn't wait to get off this ship of poor choices. Still, if the reader is looking for a lighthearted fling on a majestic ship that follows the lives and actions of 3 women from different stations that all have their own ghosts of the past and the Great War to face, well this may just be your ticket to sentimental adventures on the Atlantic.

"Well I finished and it seems I have received my full money's worth of intricate family secrets and period topics of degradation but I feel like I lost a little of my sanity somewhere in the last 300 pages. I will be honest and say, that while the research for this book was impeccable and should be applauded along with the dedication to create such a sprawling atmospheric novel that paid homage to so many easily recognized classics- the story just didn't burn consistently enough for this reader. The beginning was very slow to get my attention and too much coaxing was required to keep that spark of interest going that my mind wandered constantly to other reads that were waiting patiently, errands that needed done and everything but this book. I had such expectations and hopes that this title would completely immerse me and hold me to the last page but sometimes impulsive purchases of books do not fully satisfy. I think that is what happened here in this instance.I will say that The Quincunx did deliver: a well researched period mystery that could not be simply solved within a few chapters- I'm just not sure it was fully worth the effort on my part. I did find there were moments especially in the latter beginning that I felt a connection with a few characters but this unfortunately did not last and I really came to dislike the main character and all of the misadventures. I am so sorry to say, that the story was repetitious in many ways and the hidden strands of secrets just didn't recapture my attention after the middle portion of the story sagged horribly with slow rambling passages of dialogue. I thought the story ran on for about 300 pages too many and by the end I couldn't wait to be done but also became little miffed by the final disclosures. I'm sure some reader will absolutely love this beyond elaborate homage to the 19th-century classics but for this reader, I wish I paid more attention to other reviews and just picked this up at my local library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLUXBRC5I02Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBZ5ZL0#wasThisHelpful","R3QLUXBRC5I02Q","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over a hundred years have passed since the golden era of Edwardian superliners and we still stand in awe at the craftsmanship of these grand marvels just as those curious before us. They were said to be ""practically unsinkable"" and you know the ships' names as they were the elite of the Oceans and Seas that drew crowds of wanderers with their advertised newness and grandness to conquer the waves in style and become a story to tell within society circles. Entrancing then and now, we seem to never get enough of the prospect to explore these amazing innovations. Today however we quietly reflect as each unfortunate centennial arrives of these majestic ships that now peacefully rest at the bottom of the oceans and question what went so horribly wrong with these once wonders of the seas? While the names of Olympic, Mauretania, Britannic and Lusitania are a few names mentioned of these scrapped and lost liners, On a Sea of Glass is the Titanic's story and explores the multiple questions and mysteries that will probably forever follow in her wake.A magnificent array of historic facts will greet the reader with On a Sea of Glass: The Life and Loss of the RMS Titanic as they follow the Titanic from impressive ambitious beginnings to her harrowing demise and finally to stirring echoes of the aftermath. About half of the book is dedicated to the narrative of the Titanic as carefully researched facts and the lives of her: innovators, tradesmen, builders, designers, benefactors, passengers and crew become a unique feature of this book as their shared voices tell the ship's story. The other portion is comprised of essays that reexamine the most well known legends and conspiracy theories attached to the Titanic and another section is dedicated to the survivors and what happened to them long after April 15, 1912. There is also a segment of pictures in the back that shows places of interest, memorabilia and interesting tidbits of trivia. Stunning photographs fill chapters throughout and it becomes hard to not just stare at the page and imagine a simpler time but also the feel the icy breath of that April night on your neck.In the end, I found this work to be a masterful exploration of historic events pertaining to the Titanic. I would have to say by the time you read A Night to Remember, The Night Lives On: The Untold Stories and Secrets Behind the Sinking of the ""Unsinkable"" Ship-Titanic and On a Sea of Glass: The Life and Loss of the RMS Titanic you will know and be aware of every little fine detail that can be put forward concerning the RMS Titanic. Even though I have read the above, I still found new details and kept saying to myself (and probably a couple times out loud) ""I didn't know that"". One of the fun new topics I learned about has led me to put The White Swan Hotel in Alnwick England on my list of places I must see when I travel along with Southampton and Belfast of course. The trove of trivia seemed bottomless for me but still my favorite part of this book was when I felt like I was being tapped on the shoulder to turn around and imagine seeing a hat tipped or a gloved hand being offered or a friendly welcoming smile of a passenger or crew member as they spoke from the pages and shared their experiences aboard the Titanic. It also became very hard not to shed a tear as those same voices spoke as the hours and minutes ticked down on that last cold night and early morning in April 1912. A book with this many depths of entertainment that not only brings the pages alive but is also a magnificent preservation of history is always welcome on my shelves. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NFZVPJP5R9QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVBZSVA#wasThisHelpful","R3NFZVPJP5R9QV","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raise your hand if you love to read anything to do with Scotland. I'm raising mine proudly, ever since I was a little girl I have been drawn to this land of: rolling green mountains, breathtaking castles, rising highland mists, mysterious dark waters, noble heritages and oh the accent, how can we forget that swoon-worthy accent. I can thank my Mother for my attraction to Scotland, by allowing me access at a young age to certain films, novels and encouraging my absolute fascination with history. So it is safe to say now when I see a new novel especially one that is fiction with historical accents about the Highlands and Loch; I must have it. Enter At the Water's Edge, when I read this novel's description such visions danced in my mind and overall it was strangely entertaining.I was a little surprised that I found myself still reading after the beginning chapters and was downright shocked I was still turning the pages after everything shifted to across the Atlantic. During a devastating world war, a crazy idea to just go sailing to look for a widely believed plesiosaur (that makes one wild plot that needs handled differently) but you know somehow this story kept up the pace of changing topics and this reader's attention. The story then shifts to trials of travel and the actual search for a monster in Scotland's lochs. I had to admit that this part especially grabbed my attention being that I love to read about folklore, myths and cultural superstitions. I was not disappointed about those details, and soon found another aspect to enjoy with this novel. Very quickly this story turned dark, it went from lighthearted and a little silly to serious and amplified. Period details are shared with the reader at this point concerning the war and how it was faced by those left behind to wait and pray for their loved ones safe return.I believe the details of this story kept me fully interested and when the true sinister aspect of the story appeared along with descriptions of the land then I couldn't put this novel down. But then around the 80% mark this novel lost all steam and left this reader rolling her eyes and at a few points slapping her kindle down in disgust. I will not spoil anything for any reader but I couldn't stop shaking my head at the end. However others may not even notice what disgusted me and love every passage and that's wonderful if so. Overall this was an okay read, it was quick, more or less entertaining and did have its moments. It may help to try to forget actual history and expect a more Hollywood approach if you are interested in this one. It would make an exciting movie and I'm a little ashamed to say this reader would go see it depending on the casting or maybe I would wait for it and get it at the library. Still this is one read for those who like me can't resist the magic of the Highland and Loch, just be prepared for something a little different than what you may be envisioning.*I would like to thank Spiegel & Grau and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy At the Water's Edge","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2BXEODPQA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5557I0#wasThisHelpful","R1L2BXEODPQA3","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decorum is an evocative portrait of late 19th-century New York City society, complete with all the glitz, privilege and of course the delicate balance of etiquette that one would expect of a novel set in this marvelous setting. With only a few pages this novel sweeps the reader into the alluring world of golden society circles of Old New York in the 1890's and introduces us to a set of characters that range from those born with silver spoons in their mouths to those on the outside looking in and finally the classic keyhole views of service. As a few more chapters pass by, the reader may soon realize that Decorum is more than a story of ornamented existences and social masks; this is a story of matters for better or for worse with a crumbling era serving only a pretty backdrop. This was probably not what the reader was expecting to hear and in Ms. Christopherson's debut, she further draws this lace curtain of comfort back and adds more events that take her multifaceted company and her readers on an unexpected journey of twisted avenues of ""unpleasantness"" and a possible search for something that matters and is worth more than gold.In the end, this was an impressive read that transported this reader back to an era that I absolutely adore and can‚Äôt stop reading about. The 1881 edition of Decorum: A practical Treatise of the Etiquette and Dress of the Best American Society was a brilliant organized theme to follow and reined in everything so nicely within this story. I would have to say the beginning was my favorite and I couldn‚Äôt put it down especially when the first twists and surprises made an appearance and a veil of mystery fell over the story. If the potential reader loves a mystery, scandals and portents of misfortune; you will love the first half of Decorum. Perhaps the rest of the story the reader may not enjoy as much; I unfortunately did not.Up until the last half I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what would happen next but by then I finally admitted to myself that I didn‚Äôt care for the central character and wanted to read more about other company. Throughout there were also odd abrupt changes within the chapters switching of point of views with no warning or lead up and it caused confusion many times to stop and reread to grasp who I was currently following. Certain exciting events were curiously brushed over and ultimately missed opportunities with this reader. There was a slight abundance of overtones that although very lovely just didn‚Äôt quite fit securely into this story and at times seemed to be competing with scenes. Finally the ending just shifted from everything I adored about the beginning, to disappointment of dropped beads of amusement; I hate to sound harsh but it just wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea and didn‚Äôt seem as polished as the beginning. Still I would happily recommend Decorum to others and eagerly look forward to Ms. Christopherson's next novel. There is a brilliant gem of talent here that would make Mrs. Edith Wharton and Mr. John Galsworthy proud with the attention to setting details, tone of dialogue and charismatic array of personalities that rounds out this lovely debut.___________________________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank Kensington and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Decorum","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AW26J8HKOGBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEW75F8#wasThisHelpful","R3AW26J8HKOGBM","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I really heard the name LUSITANIA was several years ago when I was watching Antiques Roadshow and in that episode an older gentleman had a coin he found in his late aunt's attic. It turned out to be a Sinking of the Lusitania Commemorative medal and after listening to the expert explain a little about the tragedy, I wanted to discover more but at the time I could only locate repeat cursory information that left me with the disappointed impression that was all there was to learn about the subject. Then last year the name of the ship resurfaced in quite a few books I was reading about World War I and with my curiosity of this topic rekindled I purchased a couple titles but nothing caught my attention like the description for Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania. Encompassing not only an informative account of the maritime disaster but with a unique styling that I kept receiving recommendations about; I decided to take a chance. So I pre-ordered this title, waited patiently for today and eagerly downloaded this as soon as it was available in the early hours this morning. I have just finished the final page and I can't recommend this book enough because that was fantastic.I was told that Mr. Larson was the master of narrative suspense and this was clearly evident to this reader as he took me on an entertaining and informative voyage onto the luxurious Lusitania, down the periscope of the infamous U-20, into the top secret Room 40 in London, into halls of the White House and down the war trenches across Europe. It became hard to put this read down and even though I knew from history what was to follow the way the book is set up you feel every roll of the waves, the impending danger, the dampness of the fog and crushing grief that thousands must have felt in the face of such horrible events. It may become very hard for some readers not to shed a tear about the vivid passages of small children being laid to rest in a final embrace with their mothers. Or feel a shiver reading the haunting account of the last known footage of the Lusitania and its passengers waving goodbye to their loved ones or not holding your breath when clouds of deadly chlorine gas are released coming ever closer to young men hunched in the muddy trenches.I lost count of the hidden gems of trivia and the times I forgot this was history and not some very creative imagination at work, no this actually happened. I was amazed how much the Titanic (one of my favorite subjects to learn and read about) was mentioned in this book and it was strangely fascinating how passengers and crew of the Lusitania and Titanic seemed knotted together by many eerie coincidences. I also appreciated that Mr. Larson just states the facts and doesn't step onto that sometimes uncomfortable box and break the reader's immersion by injecting personal opinions into the narrative or going on some wild tangent. He lets his reader's assemble from the historic evidence what they will by presenting the bare facts in a easy accessible fashion. Which is perfect when it comes to the story of the Lusitania and final years of World War I, a lot of controversy, mystery and theories still shadow the wake of Lusitania and in Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of Lusitania every one of those are presented to reader and it is up to them to answer those lingering questions; which would make a very interesting hour at a book club discussion. Overall, this was gripping read that goes beyond those last tragic 18 minutes in May 1915 and this reader can't wait to see what the next work will be about; perhaps a certain series of intriguing events hinted at the end of this book that will be reaching a 100th anniversary in 2018? I can only hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39S11OWVT546B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD3GE#wasThisHelpful","R39S11OWVT546B","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Brethren Fortunes of France: Volume 1, captures the violent 16th century with a narrator that is perfect to share his unsettled and conflicted world with his readers. Born of a Catholic (Papist) and a Protestant (Huguenot) Pierre de Siorac is our guide into the many bloody conflicts and the first bleak outcomes of church, crown and even his own familial discord. Nothing is certain in this era as Pierre opens his personal history to us and tells us about daily occurrences, continual fears of attack from inside and outside high chateau walls and shows us the battles that rage from personal interests. A little different from other works readers may have encountered or may expect about this era being a commoner's voice is used to recreate this fascinating era versus a strictly royal perspective of the conflicting religious opinions and views. Brief appearances of French Royalty are made but only mentioned in the occasional conversation with travelers so the reader learns information as our narrator first and continually hears about the danger that is being stoked by intolerance and political gain and there is still much to come. Being the first of thirteen novels in this series more details are shared with the reader than they may bargain for and it is assured something will be learned by the last page.In the end, I will be the first to admit I was skeptical about this title. I usually prefer the royal immersion and treatment of fiction and I can never resist when I see a crown or ornamental trinket on the cover and I quickly find the time to cast out reality and slip deep into my indulgences. I'll admit it; I want the glitter of history and sometimes overlook the earthy side of the past especially when it comes to French history. I love to be proven wrong in situations like these. For me this novel was a thundering and enthralling adventure that had all the details that I always hope to encounter in fiction: a new portion of history to look further into, multifaceted characters, a believable atmospheric story and of course an entertaining balance between historic facts with creative fiction. Perhaps a little paced at the beginning as the foundation was set but once this story gathered speed it became hard to put down, something a little different and well worth the time.

"Mythology, History and Romance collide in this memorable epic that sends the reader into a world of Kings, Heroes and Immortals. Where mere mortals share tables with demigods, legends are true and blood is spilt to appease fickle and jealous Gods and Goddesses. Here Helen of Sparta speaks and leads her listeners from megarons, to painted halls, sacrificial altars and even to the bowels of the Underworld. Another view is presented to the reader by following the famed hero and demigod Theseus, who now battles his personal demons and past tragedies opposed to the mythical beasts and monsters that the bards sing of. Together Helen and Theseus create another kind of tale for the ages that ripples with feats of will and strength, perilous journeys, drama, loyalty and determination to control one's destiny that may have already been written in the stars above.In the end, this novel may have just rekindled my forgotten love of Greek Mythology and I hope there is a sequel. If anything else it was entertaining and brilliant how it combined myth with history and a good dose of romance to create an alternate beginning to a well known heroic poem. I will be completely honest and say I had my doubts especially in the beginning. I understood it was labeled under Historical fiction so I expected to find more history but once a few chapters soared by, I realized Helen of Sparta was more of a historical fantasy type novel; so a few details, tone of dialogue and narration could be slightly bent and forgiven. Ms. Carosella certainly does have a way with words and she doesn't blunt scenes, using dramatic imagery of the dark side of human nature and ancient beliefs of conquest in her tale. So any curious readers take this as a friendly warning: a few entertainment boundaries may be stepped over for some. A few slight alterations to the stories and myths we all know also greet the reader but it ultimately brings new chapters to the saga of Helen of Troy. I would recommend Helen of Sparta to those who love a good old fashioned story, when scenes dance on the walls of imaginations or those brave to explore alternate beginnings with a rich blend of Gods, Kings, the Age of Heroes and the love of one woman that binds them all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129EJ7Z4BYF13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAJZDI2#wasThisHelpful","R129EJ7Z4BYF13","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Accidental Empress is Historical fiction at its finest and most elegant form. A stunning marriage of fact and romance straight from the pages of history, that shares with the reader the story of a Duchess who ""accidentally"" captured the heart of an Emperor and ultimately became a celebrated figure. The forgotten love story of Elisabeth of Bavaria and Emperor Franz Joseph I is brought to life by Ms. Pataki's incandescent storytelling that sweeps the reader into the gold-gilded halls of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and ultimately into the mind and heart of a young woman who may have been renowned for beauty, wit and charm but battled personal demons, incredible tragedy and to have her voice heard. This novel spans from 1853-1867 with interwoven scenes of reflections of choices, fate and possible future ventures. Reminiscent in styling of classics such as Katherine and Forever Amber with its attention to historical detail and captivating atmosphere- the reader may swear they hear notes of Imperial violins by the end of this sparkling tale.In the end, I can't recommend this title enough. This was a spectacular read that found that delicate balance between historical facts, romance and even some surprising undertones. The Accidental Empress was that rare find for this reader that I didn't want the experience to end. The departing notes shares with the reader the research, honest creative liberties that were taken with this novel (miniscule in a novel so thick and those that are imaginative fiction blend so seamlessly that I could have sworn they were facts) and clearly hints at a sequel and I cannot wait for that gorgeous encore.___________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Howard Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Accidental Empress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6GOT28ZF944/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OI6W#wasThisHelpful","R2J6GOT28ZF944","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A harmless distraction soon becomes a vivid obsession for a young woman in this atmospheric suspenseful tale that is sure to excite those who love the classic Gothic genre. In Fiercombe Manor, we are first introduced to Alice Eveleigh who explains her situation and moves on to the events that led her to the door of Fiercombe Manor and the summer of 1933. From her first view of the butter colored ancestral English manor she means to learn more about her temporary surroundings and soon her raw curiosity leads her into a near forgotten mystery that has been waiting regarding a respected beauty named Lady Elizabeth Stanton. Immediately Alice's benign interest seems to wake the manor and something else takes an interest in her as the charming facade of the welcoming stones falls away and uncovers something that will not be ignored ever again. As the pages turn we follow Alice as she sinks deeper into the dark secrets and ill-fated history of this neglected manor its shadowed grounds and reveals the story of Lady Elizabeth Stanton and a granite residence called Stanton House. It seems Alice has unclasped a malignant trove of secrets and lies and what that is finally exposed may cost her dearly.In the end, this one is a keeper. It may have started out deliberately slow and paced and unfortunately I was more interested in the past versus the present narration and couldn't wait to find another chapter regarding Elizabeth; it still ended with a resounding finish though and I am excited to recommend this read. This read captured all the allure of the some of the greats of the classic Gothic genre and even managed to stand apart from its obvious inspiration and grip this reader with a haunting story that continues to unveil different hidden topics and messages days after I have finished. Not only did Fiercombe Manor capture my interest with traversing the suspense, little psychological webs of lies and forced obligations and expectations of the eras but to my complete surprise this read touched an overlooked portion of medical history and malignant malady that brought depth to the characters and had this reader eagerly reaching for her kindle as soon as real life allowed and that is what makes this read not just a good read but a great one. I will definitely be reading another novel by this author.__________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank Harper and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy Fiercombe Manor","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HB58JVEPX7G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L19WOMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HB58JVEPX7G9","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a gripping and sinister opening chapter, a small window to the past is revealed along with a narration that plunges the reader into a distorted setting with a strange mystery that consumes the narrator and ultimately drags the reader into murky depths of human nature. In this tale the reader stays in the shadows and listens to our narrator Lord Oswald de Lacy as he explains events that led to and the aftermath of widespread suspicion, continued desolation and conflicting beliefs. The story goes from dark macabre details of daily misery to an uncertain tomorrow but ultimately begins with a grisly discovery in the forests of West Kent in the year 1350 and the twists and turns you may or not expect that follow will keep the reader turning the pages until the final reveal.In the end, I guess today wasn't my lucky day with this read. I thought this would be the perfect book to read today being ""Friday the 13th"". On the surface this title covered the expected and essential topics of a murder mystery set in England during the 14th century but I am so sorry to say, although a quick read it was disappointing. I dearly wanted to love this one and perhaps other readers will enjoy this more but for me it was just too modern in the delivery. The dialogue could be at times distracting with current phrases popping up more than once, a few characters including the narrator were a little too forward thinking for the century and almost too naive to believe. Finally the end resolution was atypical and left this reader more in an undesired realm than a fully historical one.On the other side of the coin, I did enjoy the: setting, strange superstitions, herb lore and medical details. These parts shined and I was impressed how they were woven into the story. Also the final twist to this tale gave me a shiver, although the story was predictable up this point the final page was very well done. All and all, I would recommend Plague Land and I may try another in this new series. This is one read that may have a few noticeable negatives but this story set in a few years after the Great Mortality with a search for a monster, may just be worth it depending on the reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRRTUWQZMFZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LADUN9O#wasThisHelpful","R1CRRTUWQZMFZW","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Decisions, decisions, decisions"" seems to be the reappearing theme for this tale of the private and court life of Queen Elizabeth I. Being the sequel to The Lady Elizabeth, The Marriage Game spans from 1558 to 1603 and Ms. Weir takes her readers into the heart of the religious and political turmoil that consumed England during these unsettled times and places us in the mind of the woman who was seen to bring a golden light to her people and country. Instead of an unrealistic immortal view of a queen Ms. Weir shows us a mortal being that fears, contemplates and desires love during her reign on the throne. In The Marriage Game, The Court of Elizabeth I is painted in a very frantic and complicated light with whispers of scandal and impending disaster that adds to the matters of the daily life of Elizabeth I. Love is fleeting in these pages and it is sometimes hard to imagine that true love can overpower the desire for a coveted crown. And  yet Ms. Weir recreates the complicated relationship that played out in this chaotic world with Robert Dudley as Elizabeth's connection to her past and endless future possibilities and that is when she lost this reader unfortunately.Up to this point I enjoyed the complicated shard-like view of Elizabeth I but once the many ways to say ""no"" ""maybe"" and ""wait"" made a rampant montage of the chapters I became a little frustrated and disappointed. I would have to say albeit repetitious, paced (especially towards the end), with debatable speculations and a surprising missing authentic flavour of dialogue; this will not be my last read by Ms. Weir. Hearing such praise and recommendations from other readers perhaps The Marriage Game better suited to another curious reader as an introduction to the reign of Elizabeth I and this reader will try Innocent Traitor or A Dangerous Inheritance in the near future. Overall, I would still recommend The Marriage Game to those that enjoy this period of history, complicated relationships and a private view of royalty.___________________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank Ballantine Books and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Marriage Game: A Novel of Queen Elizabeth I.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R572IJMZOVTKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSS0WR8#wasThisHelpful","R572IJMZOVTKX","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1870's the Golden Age of Old New York. In one year Newland Archer and May Welland are to be man and wife. They are the toast of New York City society and everything that is to follow is deliberate and arranged. The bride-to-be as customary receives and carries her lilies-of-the-valley in plain view with a becoming blush, the proper street has been chosen where the couple will reside and the bride's engagement ring has been approved by Mrs. Mason Mingott and even called ""liberal"". Everyone is happy, approves the match and feels secure in all to come- well except perhaps the groom. After a brief encounter with May's cousin, the exotic and scandalous Countess Ellen Olenska; Newland begins questioning everything about his life and even his future. And that's when The Age of Innocence launches the reader on a journey into the confused mind and actions of Newland Archer and his ornamental world of privilege and damaging opinions.Mark Twain's quote of ""write what you know"" perfectly applies to Edith Wharton in the case of The Age of Innocence. She was born into this decorated existence and used her extensive daily knowledge of the Golden Age of New York City to paint a vivid portrait of the society she eventually left behind. The reader will learn more about late 19th-century customs, deportment and modes than other novels you may have encountered. If the curious reader has been craving a rewarding novel of manners you have found the epitome of enveloping setting, journeys and characters. Perhaps not as biting as or slower in development than The House of Mirth, The Custom of the Country or even the first part of The Buccaneers with the familiar satire and action some may have come to expect and love or perhaps this is your first encounter with the splendor of Wharton and you may not even notice. Whatever the reader's previous experience, many will agree by the end that Ms. Wharton has rightly earned her historic Pulitzer Prize with this tale of a realistic tangled love affair in the midst of the subtle action of society on the cusp of a new era of change. You simply cannot not find writing like this anymore, a sure delight for those readers who are old-fashioned in any way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7G7GMU75GVAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451530888#wasThisHelpful","R7G7GMU75GVAE","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Memory of Violets is a delicate lovely story that may have you shedding a tear by the last touching passage. Overcoming loss, finding strength and allowing forgiveness are general themes in this novel, along with the fascinating weaving of the awful plight of the 19th to early 20th-century flower and watercress sellers of London and the sentimental language of flowers. Reflections, journal entries and ethereal reminisces hold the reader's hand as forgotten worlds and lives are shared with the curious and tug at sensitive heartstrings. Readers familiar with the children's tale The Little Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen may find a creative adult version to cherish in A Memory of Violets with its various similarities, beautiful messages and final experience for the reader.In the end, I didn't expect to have this mixed reaction. In all honesty I was ready to rate this novel lower what with the unfortunate repetitious elements, pacing, a few anachronisms and predictability that haunted every other chapter but then a poignant quote about roses bringing those memories in December touched on a personal loss and whispered so much meaning to me. At that point I just took the story as it was- a sentimental tale of flowers and sisters. I was imagining a completely different story that packed another kind of punch but what I experienced was a quiet understated lovely tale that although had some serious negatives against it somehow quite unexpectedly gave me a small piece of support for these cold days to come. I guess A Memory of Violets is one of those novels that it all depends on the reader, I invite those curious to give this one a chance-you may find something special within.___________________________________________________________________________________* I would like to thank William Morrow Paperbacks and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy A Memory of Violets: A Novel of London's Flower Sellers","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCGNIU1BN8NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOG4TOY#wasThisHelpful","R1TCGNIU1BN8NG","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With inspiration of such a picturesque locale, time period and an intricate showcased painting, The Widow's Confession had quite of a bit of possibilities to explore. So much so, that unfortunately the story became a little lost in the fog of different aspects of mystery and romance that it ultimately left this reader cold. Perhaps it is just me and I have not been having much luck with my recent title purchases but this one disappointed me. I will be honest and tell those interested that this novel is slow and ebbing, slow in developing any action or conflict and ebbing with the characters and mystery that is gets all tedious to the point that I thought about quietly moving along to other novels. Although tempting at a few points something kept me reading and I did manage to finish though. This is one of those reads you stop after turning the last page and think ""and yet..and yet..""I did find the conclusion of events plausible but the journey was just sadly predictable to this reader. And yet the true positives of this read were the details. I applaud the research that went into and the incorporation into the story and perhaps that is what kept me turning the pages. Fascinating locations are visited by the central characters and in particular a few caught this reader's full attention and I would dearly love to see Margate Shell Grotto after viewing a photo gallery of this curious site. The believable incorporation of customs and era dialogue was also a joy to read, along with the catastrophe that can ensue from stepping away from tradition. And yet the characters were painted in shadow in the beginning but reveal too much of themselves so quickly at the end that there is nothing left to wonder about after they have been fully dissected with dramatic outbursts. In the end, I found The Widow's Confession a title that showcased fascinating details, vintage styled writing and although very paced; a decent winter night read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33YCGIK5OCB16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1471128121#wasThisHelpful","R33YCGIK5OCB16","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to be honest; I was disappointed with this story of secrets of servants and masters and desire to explore memories through collected recipes. This was one novel I have been anticipating for months which sounded like a change from the ordinary with an intriguing savory Gothic journey and an under-cook as the reader's guide from the quaint English country side to refined Italian villas; I think I was expecting too much sadly. This novel starts out with a striking opening but then gradually loses its desired flavour and relies on loosely stringed events to cart the story from one destination to another with a new receipt for the narrator to collect for her journal. Although an appealing inspiration for some reason the effect became lost, overdone and it all just didn't work for this reader. I was expecting more and sadly found this lite history with tastes and smatterings of the time period but not enough to clearly distinguish the 18th century and the dialogue strange with mixtures of snippets of modern with addled country tones.I have not noticed other reviewers commenting on this next observation, there are some memorable passages with graphic content that may have a few curious readers turning away but I can only think of two graphic scenes that may disturb some. It all depends on the reader. On the other side of the coin I was very interested with the incorporation of history and food and the character of Obedience Leigh (""Biddy"") was a lively character and the very beginning of her journey and the side stories of those of Mawton Hall were also very enjoyable. There are also little glimmers of some classic Gothic inspirations such as The Moonstone and Lady Audley's Secret that make appearances but are very briefly explored and left this reader wanting much more. All and all, An Appetite for Violets could be worth some readers time if they enjoy lite history, culinary journeys with a memorable and lively narrator and an ending that makes you stop and think about those gone and the special meals you shared- this may be your next read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116K3IJ3OLLTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L73JQ68#wasThisHelpful","R116K3IJ3OLLTH","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"West of Sunset is a convincing 8x10 glossie of late 1930's Hollywood and a dramatic collaboration of fact and imagination that shares the last troubled years of F. Scott Fitzgerald's life with a new audience. The story begins with the author Fitzgerald in a darkened corner of his life, his professional and private life in shambles we can sympathize with this broken figure who battles many demons as he grasps at the last shreds of limelight and luck that have bypassed him for many years. Money can't come quick enough and so a risky venture to Hollywood is seized by a hopeful Fitzgerald and what follows is one of the golden requirements of screen writing and drawing an audience; the possibility of happiness or heartbreak to follow the desperate.In the end, I personally enjoyed much of what this novel had to offer. Last year I found myself reading different fiction about the 1920's and in a quite a few titles the golden couple of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his fascinating wife Zelda dominated the topics. I believe I enjoy the champagne years more than the after-party years though and that's possibly why I didn't love the whole experience with this novel. Unfortunately also the fact that so many ghosts of addictions and demons run in a rampant montage in this work and certain details and the endless parade of cameo appearances all felt repetitive ultimately slowing the pace for this reader. A few other debatable topics were presented but perhaps it is just my understanding of facts versus the spice of the drama. Still West of Sunset was a chance to look at the man behind the notoriety and by the ending the multiple sides of F. Scott Fitzgerald were clearly evident even if they were jagged shards. Overall I did enjoy much of West of Sunset and I would recommend this title to those who love a convincing story, setting and a behind the curtain look at the famous.___________________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank PENGUIN GROUP Viking and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy West of Sunset.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDD333MK4XZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG9L5M#wasThisHelpful","R1WDD333MK4XZE","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman is a grand murder mystery that echoes in many ways Delderfield and Wharton in its presentation, undertones, social examinations, characters and overall atmosphere; this is a read to enjoy with a piping cup of English tea. Ms. Arlen sweeps her readers to the fictional grand house of Iyntwood on June 4th 1913 and with the following days introduces and presents a cast of characters that can fill the 60 rooms of the grand ancestral house to keep the reader engaged until the final page. Tradition and social order are strong themes in this novel and the notion of ""old England"" versus the imminent ""new England"" and no better conditions can be found to explore the differences than the hierarchical hive of the upstairs and downstairs order. On the surface this grand old house may seem benign and the occupants ordinary but when a grisly murder and baffling disappearances disrupts the delicate balance and an invisible sense of security is shattered, this is when the novel really shines and becomes a keeper for aficionados of classic murder mysteries and lovers of bygone eras.In the end, this reader was beyond impressed with the attention to detail however minute and highly recommends Death of a Dishonorable Gentlemen. This novel was like a slice of classic cake for me, with its comforting and satisfying effects. Ms. Arlen has certainly found a niche with her attention to historical detail and its sound absorption into her storyline, nothing shared is not used in some way to enhance and bring a deeper level to the story and end experience. The fictional setting of Iyntwood and its surrounding grounds and the small villages are painted so vividly and grandly that you just want to put them in an album of places to visit when you go to England to make sure they are only in your imagination. The huge lists of characters/suspects in this murder mystery are also impressive, every character is introduced to the reader and surprisingly it becomes very easy to tell the Lords and Ladies from the Cook, Scullery Maids and even to the surrounding village professions. Overall Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman is a memorable start of a bright star of talent and this was quite the genteel debut.___________________________________________________________________________________*I would like to thank St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYHSXIKJB1AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0IACB8#wasThisHelpful","RZYHSXIKJB1AJ","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those readers who may have morbid curiosity about certain topics and love a clever mix of genres, here is a treat just for you. Mr. Weir has created a tale that plays with the unknown and the macabre details straight from the dark side of human nature and history that pulls the unwary into a tale of combating and debatable topics and messages. Is Will Starling a story of miracles or simple coincidences? A tale that pulls details from Mythology and Theology and invites further questions concerning the delicate balance between life and death after the reader has finished? Or is this a collaborative narration with events that are shrouded in superstition or can be simply explained by advancements in medicine? Fellow readers Will Starling is all the above.Will Starling is the reader's ""wery umble narrator"" as he weaves a twisted recollection of events by a guttering candle and leads his audience into an underworld of life and death that played out in early 19th-century London and on the battlefields beyond. Our narrator is a surgeon's apprentice who has a remarkable mind and keen interest in his benefactor's profession who loves nothing more than a large word he can mimic and a fledgling actress named Annie Smollet who only seems to see his diminutive status and his other unfortunate physical flaws. Despite imperfections and personal history our narrator welcomes his readers and takes us into a gritty realistic world that concerns advancements of the medical community and the old wives tales that pose unrelenting negative views and fear of the unknown concerning physicians, surgeons and primarily what goes on behind closed doors at the anatomical colleges. Events are further built upon and threads of a dark mystery are sewn into a shroud of speculation that enfold a fascinating cast of characters that takes us into the vary twisted bowels of Will Starling's adoptive world and opens our minds and eyes to the horrors and sometimes benefits of science.In the end, Will Starling is a book that is a little difficult for me to fully describe but was a haunting entertaining look at medical history and held so many different facets that appealed to this reader and became a title I would gladly recommend. Will Starling is so much more than a grisly story about resurrectionists or doomsday men and the consequences of playing God with the unknown or a sinister literary mix of Dickens and Shelley. Mr. Weir has created a tale that brilliantly pays homage to the advancements of medicine and science during the 19th century and even a few cameo appearances are made by those who pioneered the way for future professions that have become respected in our current era. As a Nurse I am always fascinated by these stories and am in awe at the advancements we have made, but Will Starling is still much more than a story about progress and sharing of macabre historical details. This story has so many different facets and the narrator is ideal for this tale and the dialogue is delivered in a perfect believable tone and pulled this reader straight into the dark heart of London in the early 19th century. Although this is certainly a paced read and the sometimes haphazard events strung together by the narrator caused me distraction to reread a few passages to only realize these were cleverly hidden threads to the mystery this novel was still a treat that I savored and I couldn't ask for more.

"Miramont's Ghost is a story that would fit perfectly in a section of variegated Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Instead of the dark forests of Germany, this tale takes the reader into bucolic 19th-century Beaulieu France with an established aristocratic family as the central characters and their secrets that can destroy all within. Gossip can be just as poisonous and deadly as arsenic and in Miramont's Ghost this simple fact is weaved into a complicated noose that threatens to strangle the youngest generation of the castle. Whether the location shifts from the opulent opera houses of Paris, the polished floors of the Waldorf in New York City or the majestic mountain towns of Colorado; past sins and ugly rumors seem to follow and the hushed whispers begin yet again and well to be polite there are some things best left unsaid and unknown.In the end, Miramont's Ghost was a quick read that held my interest until the final page. A decent mixture of folklore, unsolved mysteries, surprising undertones and old fashioned storytelling that served as a needed distraction is how I would describe this title. Although quite a few times I found myself wincing at anachronistic dialogue, minor slips in history and aristocratic protocol, a few strings of forced and predictable drama and the story was a little lackluster in spots of potential that really could have shined for this reader. That all aside, Miramont's Ghost is still an entertaining read that touches on all the familiar elements of a ghost story that we all still eagerly lean in to hear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6YSYLMW117K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTBWMJ6#wasThisHelpful","R2B6YSYLMW117K","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set during 1869 the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania serves as our historic backdrop for this most unusual murder mystery that begins with the ugly gossip that greedy charlatans are preying on the desperate and bereaved of the city as rich and poor reach into shadows and knock on inconspicuous doors begging for a chance to hear one final message from departed loved ones. But it can't be all bunkum, can it? Mr. Edward Clark believes it is and when asked by his employer to investigate the alarming number of claims around the city that people can contact and converse with the dead and then write an expose of the truth he is reluctant to accept the assignment and is determined not to become concerned in the matters of Spiritualism. What then starts out as a mundane and trivial venture for this reporter may soon open windows to other worlds and beg the questions of: is there something else at work in the parlors of Philadelphia or are these some of the cruelest tricks imaginable being played on the public?In the end, Things Half in Shadow was an entertaining mixture of some fascinating topics to this reader. This novel had quite a bit of details that I crave and honestly how could I not read about fraudulent mediums, the vogue of Spiritualism and a mysterious bizarre death that occurs in a locked room. With visions dancing in my mind, I jumped into this read with such expectations. Overall some of those expectations were surpassed in regards to the amount of pages dedicated to the practices of S√©ances, illusions, the Civil War seen though the eyes of a soldier and the respectful handling of the psychological aftermath. Those details shined but then I figured out too many of the twists very early, the dialogue and narration at times read as modern, there were a few holes of history in the story and one very noticeable plot hole and even though the novel moved very fluidly to the next event and topic it unfortunately tended to just ramble with going over the same locations and particulars. With breaks in between of action scenes worthy of a Hollywood production (and this would be a great novel to turn into a movie) the novel did become very vivid and fun with believable feats though. Still I would recommend Things Half in Shadow to those readers who can overlook a few negatives and prefer to just enjoy an unusual story as it unfolds. This novel seems to be the first of a new unique series that blends that mysterious fine line between life and death and I am very interested to read the next installment.*I would like to thank Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Things Half in Shadow","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVU9UJZEUPK7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYDKX38#wasThisHelpful","RVU9UJZEUPK7L","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An amazing read for those who adore rich historical pieces and wish to fully acquaint (or perhaps form an imaginary alliance) with figures from history. Mr. Druon takes this reader on a brilliant venture every time I open another novel in this addicting saga and The Lily and the Lion was my latest feast. Being the sixth in The Accursed Kings series it was bittersweet to realize as I finished this splendid work that only one more novel remains. But as the saying goes ""all good things must come to an end"" and so it goes with much to do with The Lily and the Lion. This novel's timeline is January 24 1328 to the beginning of January 1343 and then has an additional epilogue of September 22 1354 to 1362.  A lot is captured and shared with the reader and Mr. Druon had an extraordinary style in his writing that passes time effortlessly for the benefit of his readers that they are never lost with regards to time and only enjoy themselves as they rejoin their favorite characters as the years age and takes them to their next journey, alliance, deception or atrocious sin. Those familiar with this addicting series should understand all too well that no one is considered safe in these vivid pages and not to spoil anything for themselves by peeking and researching the names of characters. As always the author has stuck as close to historic fact and conjured the blood and breath to flow into his characters with his pen and this is a grand experience not to miss.

"Well that was not quite the experience this reader had unfortunately. Having finished The House of Mirth in awe and finding myself a new classic to cherish at that moment Ms. Wharton became one of my favorite authors and when I finished The Custom of the Country and had unexpectedly fallen under the spell of the wicked Undine Spragg; I just had to seek out more by Ms. Wharton. Enter The Buccaneers, when I read the description I knew this was going to be my next reason to my local library.At first my every wish was anticipated and I fell into that familiar and welcoming voice of the eloquent styling of Ms. Wharton with her distinct society scenes, fluid mingling of topics with satire and witty dialogue. The characters were as captivating as always and the scenes painted so beautifully I could see the luster from the pearls at throats and on dainty ears, almost feel the tickling kiss of gentlemen's groomed moustaches, hear the swish of elegant gowns and of course taste the English tea. That's the sort of story I crave, to immerse myself in a forgotten time period and just let myself relax forgetting the current world. It was fascinating to learn as I read that characters were mirrored after real people and that events from history were pulled into this story. I also learned as I was reading that this was sadly Ms. Wharton's last novel and it was unfinished until the 1990's. I really didn't think that should matter to me, I thought I wouldn't notice. I was wrong.I'm sure Ms. Mainwaring meant no harm and only tried to recreate the elegance and thrumming of the storyline but I am so sorry to say it just didn't work. There is an abrupt crack of styling that just spoils the rest of the story and it became very hard to pay attention with the odd descriptions and metaphors, structure and path the story raced down with an ending that felt hurried and lacking. The dialogue also felt clunky and forced with no believability and it was obvious in the hands of another author the characters failed to rise again to the magnificence of the beginning of the novel. Perhaps it was just me that I didn't think the ending satisfying enough or not what I had anticipated and I would not blatantly discourage others from The Buccaneers, the beginning is simply fabulous and you just can't find writing like that anymore which is truly a shame. Oh well, onto The Age of Innocence for this reader.Reviewed in December 2014, review written December 2014/ copy of The Buccaneers borrowed from local library","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATBYQ9WZ7TZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140232028#wasThisHelpful","RATBYQ9WZ7TZ0","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been consistently amazed by this series and cannot recommend this collection of works enough to those who have been searching for a brilliant series to curl up with, forget the outside world and entrust themselves in following the lives of a distinct album of characters that brings the courts of 14th-century Europe and the beginning of the battle thunder of the Hundred Years War to life for the modern reader. These novels introduce complex characters, believable dialogue, rich scenes and unparalleled storytelling each time another part of this epic into the House of Capet is opened. Seven novels make up this epitome of historical research and daring imagination and the new reader is strongly encouraged to please begin their journey into the cursed halls of the House of Capet with The Iron King. Although the succeeding novels have a short summarization for the benefit of the unfamiliar, it still may help to grasp all the alliances, compounding secrets, betrayals and reasoning behind all shifting political manoeuvres by starting at the very foundation that Mr. Druon has set- but it is ultimately your choice.The She-Wolf is the fifth installment of The Accursed Kings series and takes the reader this time to across the channel to England in a time span of August 1 1323 to the end of September 1327 and examines human frailties in many forms along with a daring tale of escape, exile and returns. In this realm two souls wait, one burning with resentment and desire for revenge and the other neglected and starving for love and attention. And when fate throws these two souls together disaster may ensue for those all involved. In The She-Wolf love has many forms and there are many ways to kill a man and in this tale, legends and whispers are brought to brutal light in forms of unbridled imagination that only deepens one of history's shrouded mysteries with the cryptic message of ""without trace"". The sharing of court secrets are as tempting as ever to reveal and it is a simple fact that no one's hands are free from a drop of previously spilled blood. So let the wheel of fate spin another round with The She-Wolf and who knows you may finish questioning just who the real wolf is.Reviewed in December 2014, review written December 2014/ copy of THE SHE-WOLF OF FRANCE (THE ACCURSED KINGS, BOOK 5) borrowed from local library","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEO11W88O2AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007491336#wasThisHelpful","R3PEO11W88O2AA","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Astrologer is a stellar read that may have been missed by quite a few readers and that's truly a shame because this was marvelous experience as well as an unexpected momentary break from this reader's usual that proved most fortunate. I say momentary because I couldn't stop reading this title and finished it in two sittings. But with an enthralling tale teeming with deception, madness, and cries of vengeance from restless ghosts with disastrous twists worthy of Shakespeare, it really should be no wonder that I finished The Astrologer so quickly and highly recommend this gem of a find.Set in 17th-century Denmark the reader is immediately confronted with a battle to the death scene with our narrator Soren Andersmann standing on the edge of all the disorder. But this is only the opening and there is still much more to come. As royal astrologer Soren is privy to the secrets of the household of King Christian IV and as the story continues little by little our narrator reveals his past and his ultimate vow of vengeance against the King of Denmark for the murder of Tycho Brahe- a genius and mentor to Soren but a dangerous madman to many others. Now armed with his wooden box full of death and falsified charts the scene is set for a unique and magnificently fashioned tale of the throne of power and desire, combating philosophies of beliefs and the unsteady fickle hand of fate all set in a land that can freeze a man's heart. I don't know about you, but I couldn't possibly ask for more from a historical novel. Bravo Mr. Bailey!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMZ3UR0T9EBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFCAPQS#wasThisHelpful","RXMZ3UR0T9EBE","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Firebird's Feather was my first title but certainly not my last read from Ms. Eccles. With a setting and plot I would never decline an invitation to visit, I had no idea what to expect and by the last page I had a neutral feeling that finally settled this morning on I liked this title enough to try another. A light historical mystery is how I would describe The Firebird's Feather; enough details shared to capture a wispy postcard of London during 1911 with a genteel lady's murder at the center and the beginning of a desperate quest for answers for a young woman on the cusp of entering society. This alone would usually completely enchant this reader but I am sorry to say I had a difficult time staying focused on this title in the beginning and a few parts throughout.Characters were introduced only at a distance and the main character even more at a distance to this reader. It seemed many times the main character fluttered from event to event and I never felt engaged and more interested in following other characters. Unfortunately no character could be found however what I did find to follow were the unique details and topics that propelled the story. With the brilliant introduction of Slavic folklore and particularly the story of the Firebird this title became an interesting find and a clever meeting of England and Russia that I would recommend to those potential readers who love to encounter unorthodox and Orthodox themes.*I would like to thank Severn House and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Firebird's Feather.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5DHLW0GTRQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OERTV00#wasThisHelpful","RI5DHLW0GTRQ7","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Queen of Bedlam is a mixture of well researched fiction that splits into multiple viewpoints that may leave the reader with a feeling of closing well spent hours on a surprising anti-fairy tale. The novel delves into the shadows of an overlooked branch of the British monarchy, and swirls around the choices and projected obligations of characters in the faces of chaos, illness and tradition. Although choppy at times in pacing and jumping unexpectedly forward in years and location, Queen of Bedlam creates a swift read that pulls the eager reader into the heart of the 18th and early 19th-century English court. With transitioning of chapters that center around one out of the three main characters, passages take on beautiful symbolic meaning and almost seem poetic in description. At times over dramatic but still overall enchanting, the novel weaves detailed history, complex relationships and even some religious undertones into a surprising good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TP16G9DC0YC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8P53ZI#wasThisHelpful","R1TP16G9DC0YC9","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Appearances can be deceiving, take for an example this novel's cover art. What an unsuspecting appearing cover, I will be the first to admit I thought of a completely different genre when I first saw it and began reading I felt I had made a mistake and this was not the type of story I could finish and should quietly move on to the other reads that have been waiting patiently. Ah but how quickly this book proves the adage: don't judge a book by its cover. This book transforms quickly within a few chapters from an innocent love story to a tragic wicked nightmare that grips the reader and it becomes nearly impossible to look away from.In The Ripper's Wife, our narrator flips through her album of dark memories and invites the reader to look over her shoulder and witness the sinister side of romance. She only asks that all judgment be held until the final tattered page falls and what soon appears from the snap shots of our narrator's reminisces is a twisted tale with a young woman in the midst of a brutal nightmare. Horror can come in many forms and for our narrator hers wears a deerstalker, carries a bag of gore and whose shadowy secrets will become one of the most debatable historical mysteries the world has ever known.In the end, The Ripper's Wife was a chilling unsuspecting tale of noteworthy historical research that coincided with an entertaining fictional tale of ""what if""; that this reader couldn't put down. If the potential reader is not familiar with the names James Maybrick or his wife Florence Chandler Maybrick- do yourself a favor and not spoil the experience by researching anything before you finish The Ripper's Wife. Ms. Purdy has created a tale that seems so innocent but the passages that follow may haunt your dreams with the vivid descriptions that show the multifaceted levels that can be accomplished by those who have a brilliant imagination and are not afraid to step over the line and explore the alternate of history or turn a warped mystery into a page turner. I hope it is no surprise to any potential reader that this story can be disturbing at times and does contain strong unexpected language; so please take this as a friendly warning that entertainment boundaries may be overstepped for a few with The Ripper's Wife. Still this read was an unexpected page turner for this reader and one read that I am sure will stay in my mind days to come about the creation of a monster and ""the Autumn of Terror"" of 1888.*I would like to thank Kensington Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Ripper's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYZWFA7PLG6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVW6GZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XYZWFA7PLG6N","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Beautiful Lies was an elegant historical novel that captured multiple locations in Europe during 1887, I am sorry I did not enjoy this promenade of secrets and deceptions. This novel immersed this reader into familiar and enthralling details but lost me on the pacing and the repetitious nature and habits of the characters. A lot of patience is asked of the reader and perhaps I was not in the mood to submit, I was hoping more in terms of the appeal of the secrets or even the resolution but I guess this one just wasn't for me. However, the attention to historical detail was exquisite and I will be reading another title from Ms. Clark in the near future. I would recommend this read to those who love the Victorian Era and those readers who have been looking for an elegant read about a strong personality that wears a string of secrets with pride and walks the streets with a hint of a smile.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R768I3EYZM9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LQ22WO#wasThisHelpful","R768I3EYZM9N","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
